 Analysis and Planning. Subcontractor shall support the Prime in the conduct of engineering analyses to predict performance attainable through experimentation and tie experiment objectives and scenarios to relevant mission use cases. Subcontractor shall provide inputs to requirements definition and feedback to design of platforms, systems and equipment needed for successful execution of experiments. 
 
 Experiment Prep. Subcontractor shall configure and make ready ground support equipment needed for execution of experiments. Subcontractor shall provide sample data representative of that anticipated in the experiment and support the Prime in the pre-test analysis of the data.
 
 Experiment Execution. Subcontractor shall provide field support to experiments at designated test sites in accordance with project test plan, sites to be pre-approved for Subcontractor s system test activities. Subcontractor shall provide necessary ground support equipment and personnel, and provide data collected in the conduct of the experiment. (S0003, S0004, S0005). Subcontractor shall participate in a  Dry-run  experiment in Ypsilanti, MI and customer experiment in Huntsville, AL with Eglin FL as a back up. Tentative dates are Oct, 2020, and late Nov, 2020. Duration of the Michigan event is eight contiguous days; the Alabama event is seven contiguous days.
 
 Data Analysis. Subcontractor shall support the Prime in the interpretation of processed results from the experiment and in the generation of sample products.
 
 System Concept Development and Mission Modeling.  Subcontractor shall provide data and support the Prime in the development of models which enable performance prediction in association with prospective mission concepts.
 
 Program Management.  Subcontractor shall provide project management to coordinate its efforts with the Prime and to manage Subcontract execution. Subcontractor shall provide status inputs in support of monthly reporting objectives.
 
 Meetings.  Subcontractor shall participate in a project Kickoff meeting, a Test Readiness Review meeting, and a Final Review meeting.
 
 Deliverables
  System parametric data and constellation characteristics in support of experiment planning and mission modeling (S0001).
  Data which are representative of that which will be collected in the experiment, in support of pre-test development of applicable processing algorithms and software (S0002)
