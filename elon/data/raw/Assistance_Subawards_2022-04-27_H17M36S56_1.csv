 understanding that, if this proposal is approved and reasonable progress is maintained over the 
 execution period, the grant is expected to be renewed on a yearly basis over this timeframe.
 Specific Aim 1: Enable the development and execution of human research in commercial spaceflight 
 opportunities at SpaceX
 (a) Establish a research capability at SpaceX to effectively and efficiently interface with all 
 stakeholders in the pursuit of human research opportunities in commercial spaceflights
 (b) Support all of the research-related work specific to the I4 mission and any other commercial 
 missions that are contracted over the grant period
 (c) Pursue and promote research as a core component of future commercial spaceflight missions
 Specific Aim 2: Develop research infrastructure to support data management, integration of multiple 
 data sources, and streamlining of standard measures
 (a) Support the development of a data repository that can host all data from commercial spaceflight 
 research, including facilitating the transfer and uploading of research, and relevant operational 
 and medical data to the database
 (b) Provide feedback and relevant operational expertise to help inform the development of standard 
 measures for commercial spaceflight in coordination with TRISH, including preliminary assessment of 
 hardware needs that would support collection of standard measures
 Specific Aim 3: Flight certification of new research hardware
 (a) Formulate a risk posture at SpaceX for commercial missions with respect to 
 commercial-off-the-shelf electronics, in order to have a clear path towards hardware certification
 (b) Provide relevant operational and hardware feedback to PIs in the development of their in-flight 
 experiment
 (c) Work with certification engineers to perform hardware qualification testing campaigns and 
 obtain flight certification for research hardware Milestones, Deliverables and Timeline
 Deliverables for year 1 include:
 - Creating the necessary infrastructure for human research, including obtaining Federal-Wide 
 Assurance (FWA) approval, IRB approvals, and ensuring up to date human-subject training for all 
 relevant personnel
 - Supporting all of the research development for I4, including pre-flight, in-flight, and 
 post-flight protocols, and execution of the experiments
 - Transferring all research and relevant operational data into the research repository
 - Collaborating in a timely manner with experiment PIs on the preparation of manuscripts for 
 publication
 - Promoting commercial spaceflight research through relevant PR opportunities in coordination with 
 all relevant stakeholders
 
 Key Milestones for the project for year 1 include: (1) launch of I4 mission, currently scheduled 
 for Sept 15, 2021, and (2) successful completion of all post-flight data collection and data 
 transfer to the respective PIs, estimated to occur before end of 2021. Upcoming milestones for 2022 
 calendar year will include development of a research portfolio for a 2nd upcoming commercial 
 spaceflight (not yet confirmed) and the publication of research from the I4 mission. Upon 
 confirmation of the next SpaceX commercial flight, a similar set of deliverables will be assembled 
 and included as part of the research work. The overall expectation is that a similar workflow and 
 set of deliverables will be included as part of research work in any future commercial missions that are contracted and executed within the grant
 period.",Gwynne  Shotwell,4077012.00,Bret  Johnsen,3079137.00,Timothy  Hughes,1868953.00,David  Anderman,1818183.00,Mark  Juncosa,1753618.00,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NNX16AO69A_8000/,2022-03-23 15:20:22+00
