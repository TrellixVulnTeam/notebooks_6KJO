# Trump tweets

This repo contains an analysis of President Trump's tweets — specifically the daily frequency and mentions of California — based on data downloaded in `JSON` format from the [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive) and scraped over the years using [Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint). Also included in this repo are Jupyter notebooks detailing analysis and charts. 

The data and analysis in the repo were used in a story about Trump's California-related tweets in the *Los Angeles Times*.
