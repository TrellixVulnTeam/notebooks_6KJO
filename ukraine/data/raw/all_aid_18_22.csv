The purpose of this GDA is to increase the incomes of 4,300 rural households in Upper Egypt. The implementing partner will improve the capacity of smallholder farmers to respond to market signals, produce high quality produce, and maintain that quality through cold-chain infrastructure, increasing access to national and international markets through the facilitation of direct linkages with exporters and processors. -Provide technical assistance to 15 smallholder farmer associations (FAs) at the Center of Excellence -Guide production planning using timely market and logistical information-Facilitate the utilization and maintenance of a state-of-the-art post-harvest collection center at the Luxor Perishable Terminal.-Support the establishment of forward contracts between FAs and the domestic and export markets.",AID-263-A-15-00014,2015-02-04,2018-09-30,2,Obligations,2020,-43747,-43747
