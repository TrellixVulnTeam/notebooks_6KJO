In a five to four decision Thursday, the nation‚Äôs highest court ruled the Biden administration can terminate the Trump-era Remain in Mexico policy. The high court found the administration‚Äôs push to end the policy did not violate federal immigration law.Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh sided with the court‚Äôs liberal justices in the ruling. The policy, first enacted in 2019, required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their claims were processed in court. Thursday‚Äôs decision now paves the way for Biden to go through with ending the policy. Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has called on the Biden administration to reinstate Trump-era policies, while asserting they have proved to be effective.‚ÄúBuilding a border wall, keeping in place both Title 42 and the Remain in Mexico policy and enforcing those,‚Äù Abbott stated. ‚ÄúSo, those policies remain in effect right now. However, it is my understanding that the way we see it, Biden is not enforcing those. Ending catch and release. Those are the four things that are very simple to do.‚ÄùEarlier, the Supreme Court sided with Joseph Kennedy, a former high school football coach in Washington State, who was let go for publicly praying on the field after games. In the court‚Äôs opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch explained that both the free exercise and free speech clauses of the First Amendment protect expressions like Mr. Kennedy‚Äôs.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for the Christians or the Jews, or the atheists or whoever,‚Äù said Kennedy. ‚ÄúIt is for all Americans and that‚Äôs why I thought this was such a huge win. It‚Äôs more a freedom of speech thing for me personally because it was just a moment between me and God. It had nothing to do with anybody else.‚ÄùAdditionally, the Supreme Court issued a ruling limiting the federal government‚Äôs authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. In a six-to-three decision, the court ruled the EPA cannot pass sweeping carbon dioxide emissions regulations without congressional approval. This is a victory for West Virginia and a number of other GOP-led states that challenged the EPA while arguing the Clean Air Act did not give the agency power to impose such broad regulations.The ruling could have far reaching ramifications as it may curb the Biden administrations capability to promote green energy through regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey responded to the Supreme Courts decision and thanked all the states that were part of the process.Alos, the Supreme Court welcomed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson Thursday as she was sworn in as the first black woman to serve on the nations highest court. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer officially stepped down from the bench after a 28-year career. Jackson is slated to participate in arguments for the first time during the court‚Äôs next term beginning in October.","FILE ‚Äì This Oct. 4, 2018, file photo shows the U.S. Supreme Court at sunset in Washington.¬† (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21302863422771-e1656534397130.jpg,"¬†N.Y.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:20 AM PT ‚Äì Friday, July 1, 2022The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act does not give the EPA broad or expansive powers to regulate carbon emissions, in turn, leaving it up to states. In a six to three vote on Thursday, the high court decided the executive agency could not impose regulations on states that restrict carbon emissions to encourage a transfer to renewable energy.The decision was met with praise from Republicans who argued the EPA could not implement such regulations nationally, while Democrats viewed it as a step backwards in fighting so-called climate change. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who spearheaded the legal challenge, called the decision a huge victory because it reaffirms the concept of separation of powers.‚ÄúWe want to make sure that the Biden agenda is limited by basis of what Congress authorized these agencies,‚Äù Morrisey. ‚ÄúWhat a concept that is and this should not be considered to be anything other than consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and our separation of powers.‚ÄùMeanwhile across the aisle, several Democrat governors vowed to double down on their efforts to fight so-called climate change. Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) expressed disappointment in the decision and said state and local governments will have to pick up where the executive branch left off.‚ÄúWe have to accelerate our efforts to reduce carbon pollution in the state of Washington in the upcoming years and that‚Äôs necessary because the federal government now is going to be, frankly, much less effective in restraining pollution, which means more of that burden is going to be on our shoulders,‚Äù said Inslee. ‚ÄúAnd we are willing to accept that because Washington State is not going to allow climate change to swallow our state.‚ÄùInslee did not clarify what he plans to do in light of the ruling. However, California Governor¬† (D) took a more direct approach by announcing on Twitter that he will be signing a $54 billion climate fighting plan.‚ÄúThe idea that the US Supreme Court moved to take away one of the most significant and historically powerful tools to address the ravages of climate change is incomprehensible,‚Äù asserted Newsom. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to wake up to what‚Äôs going on, Supreme Court.

It is a day that reveals to him more than any other day of the year. The gross conduct and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham.‚ÄùOn July 5, 1852 in Rochester, New York, former slave Frederick Douglass addressed a white audience about America‚Äôs Independence Day. Douglass was invited to speak on the Fourth of July but instead chose to give his remarks the following day, which is when most African Americans who were free and enslaved chose to celebrate. He wanted to show a contrast between the high ideals of freedom with the hypocrisies of the existence of slavery in the nation.Douglass was born into slavery in 1818 but managed to escape his Maryland plantation 20 years later. He became a successful author after gaining his freedom. He wrote autobiographies about his life experiences as an American slave.Douglass became the pre-eminent fighter for liberating all slaves in the years following. He advocated for their equality and citizenship. While speaking before the Rochester Ladies‚Äôs Anti-Slavery Society in 1852, he informed them of his first hand account of the horrors he was made to endure because of the ongoing violation of the nation‚Äôs highest ideals.‚ÄúMark the sad procession,‚Äù he spoke. ‚ÄúHeat and sorrow nearly consumes their strength. Suddenly you hear a quick snap like the discharge of a rifle. The fetters clank, the chains rattle, your ears are saluted with the scream that seems to have torn its way into the center of your soul.‚ÄùHowever, Douglass recognized the foundations of the US to be based on that of human liberty. He declared American society of the time to be rife with hypocrisy and flagrantly violating the founding principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution.‚ÄúYou boast of your love for liberty, your high civilization, your pure Christianity, while all the while, your whole political power of the nation conspires to hold in bondage three million of its countrymen,‚Äù he uttered.Despite the deep criticisms of contemporary American society, Douglass recognized how vital the Fourth of July is to the nation‚Äôs spirit.‚ÄúThis, for the purpose of this celebration is the Fourth of July,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúIt is the birthplace of your national independence. It is to you what the pass over was to the emancipated people of God. It brings your minds back to that day and an act of your great deliverance!‚ÄùHe expressed his great fealty to the Declaration of Independence and the war for independence from the crown.‚ÄúBut your fathers, who had not chimed in of the popular idea of the day, of the infallibility of government, began to differ with those burdens and restraints,‚Äù Douglass said passionately. ‚ÄúThey went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the English Government as unruly, unjust and oppressive.‚ÄùDescendants of Frederick Douglass deliver his famous ‚ÄúWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?‚Äù speech https://t.co/JtEv9LvMq6 pic.twitter.com/Fd9PuGHBvh‚Äî philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) July 4, 2022‚ÄúWhat to the slave is 4th of July?‚Äù By Frederick Douglass, read by James Earl Jones. #FourthofJuly via @democracynow pic.twitter.com/c9PbrgrOKt‚Äî Nina Turner (@ninaturner) July 4, 2022While Douglass was a harsh critic of American society at the time he also understood the high ideals of the nation‚Äôs founding. He believed the Constitution to be a great anti-slavery document.
