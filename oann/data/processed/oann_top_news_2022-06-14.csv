10:07 AM PT",GAO: Biden’s ‘infrastructure’ bill was inefficient,"The Government Accountability Office found President Joe Biden’s so-called infrastructure bill, which passed last year, was inefficient. According to new GAO report, Democrats spent at least $65 billion with “no national strategy” or obligation to update America’s internet services.The reported noted, the Biden administration does not have a plan to provide high-speed internet to all Americans. The $1.2 trillion bill did not even require government agencies to develop a broadband strategy.It’s unclear how that money was spent. Republican lawmakers have said Biden’s spending spree was the main factor behind runaway inflation sweeping the US.“You have to understand why demand went up everywhere, why did it go up across all segments of the economy,” explained GOP Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “Because we printed money, we just passed out money. We literally passed it out this time around, but inflation is basically a consequent of debt. So in the last two years, we added $6 trillion worth of debt. We’ve never added that much debt in our history.”New GAO report finds that the Administration has no national strategy guiding the federal government’s spending of billions of dollars on broadband infrastructure.That’s like turning the spigot on full blast and walking away from the hose. Taxpayers are bound to get soaked. pic.twitter.com/XRfbaNWW2U— Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) June 10, 2022Following the GAO report, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr called for accountability and transparency at the federal government. He asserted its spending spree has, indeed, fueled inflation.","FILE- In this June 19, 2018, file photo a router and internet switch are displayed in East Derry, N.H.

If you have a permit, you should be good to go everywhere. I have a permit and I’m not shooting people here. If I carried in the city, would I be a danger to shoot people? Absolutely not. The only one I’m going to shoot is someone who needs shooting, someone who’s a threat to me or someone else. Those of us who have permits, who have gone through the process of permitting, we’re the most law abiding people on the planet.”Additionally, Second Amendment advocates voiced their disdain for the banning of high capacity magazines, which was part of an omnibus package passed by the House of Representatives in response to the mass shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo.“Illegal gun owners are running around with high capacity magazines,” voiced the instructor. “But me, as a legal gun owner in the state of New York, I’m limited to ten rounds in my magazine. That person could have 30. Who would you bet on to win that fight? Some of my bullets are not going to make contact and some of his are not, but he has more of them.”They then went on to voice their support for a solution to mass shootings being advocated for by most conservatives both at the state and federal level.“Schools are a soft spot for me having been a father,” he expressed. “I personally feel that if someone is going to educate my child, they should also protect my child. When it comes to teachers personal feelings are removed from it, they’ve already shown that they’re capable of higher education. Firearms are not complicated devices, they’re very simple. I personally feel you are the last line of defense with that room full of children. If you’re there willing to educate them, you should be there willing to defend them with your life.”Across the country, gun violence is wreaking havoc on our communities, and New York is not going to wait for another tragedy to step up and act.I'm proud to join New York leaders to enact nation-leading, common sense gun laws that will protect our communities. pic.twitter.com/AKbWz2wdfk— NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) June 6, 2022In the meantime, the Supreme Court is expected to issue their ruling within the next few weeks.

The President accused Big Oil of exploiting supply shortages to boost profits.While addressing dockworkers at the port of Los Angeles on Friday, Biden claimed oil and gas companies are using the war in Ukraine to justify excessive price hikes. His finger pointing comes as the national average price of gas is $4.99 per gallon and is more than $5 a gallon in 19 states, according to AAA.Joe Biden’s America: •40-year high inflation•Record gas prices•Baby formula shortage•Disastrous border crisis•Crime surge Biden’s policies have failed Americans.— GOP (@GOP) June 13, 2022However, the President went into his typical “whisper mode” to deflect responsibility away from his policies that have cancelled oil field leases and restricted drilling .“They have 9000 permits to drill, they’re not drilling. Why aren’t they drilling?” Biden asked. “Because they make more money not producing more oil. The price goes up, number one. And number two, the reason they’re not drilling is they’re buying back their own stock, which should be taxed, quite frankly. Buying back their own stock and making no new investments.”Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton responded to Biden’s comments.

For starters, Norton said Exxon is significantly expanding its operations in Texas.Last month, the Biden administration cancelled three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska, removing millions of acres from possible drilling.","President Joe Biden arrives at Kirtland Air Force Base to meet with state and local officials on the New Mexico wildfires, Saturday, June 11, 2022, in Albuquerque, N.M.

That, as Director Roemer said, is literally costing American lives on both sides of the border.”Pence went on to say the American people see what’s happening at the southern border and he hopes voters will elect a new generation of leaders who’ll focus on border security. This comes as critics have lambasted the Biden administration’s immigration policies, with several claiming it is causing more illegal immigration.Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) tested positive for COVID-19 and wasn’t able to attend the planned political event with Pence. Both are working to amplify GOP messaging on border issues that they see as a potent political issue.","WASHINGTON, DC – NOVEMBER 30: Former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the National Press Club on November 30, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on domestic terrorism, Tuesday, June 7, 2022, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:20 PM PT – Monday, June 13, 2022A bipartisan group of senators announced a framework for gun control following the recent mass shootings in New York and Texas. On Sunday, the senators announced they had reached an agreement for increased mental health and school security funding, as well as expanded checks on buyers under 21.However, one provision could allow states to violate multiple constitutional rights of it’s citizens. Part of the framework includes a provision to give taxpayer funded incentive grants to states, which implement so-called red flag laws.Such laws, already in place in 19 states and Washington D.C., allow neighbors, coworkers, ex-relations and family members to go to a judge and petition to have guns taken from individuals they claim are dangerous. A judge can typically order an immediate seizure of firearms, sending police to the home to remove the guns.“Put simply, red flag laws empower the government to take firearms first and ask questions later. Often much, much later,” stated Senator Ted Cruz.No crime has to have been committed, just the accusation of being “dangerous” to yourself or others. The judge can have the separation order enforced without the citizen being present to defend themselves in court. According to the far-left ACLU, such laws can infringe not only on the Second Amendment, but also violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment if they are not tailored properly.A prime example of an issue that could arise from such measures occurred in Maryland back in 2018. A man had a red flag order placed against him and while no information on the reason for the order has been released, the man was not committing any crime by continuing ownership of the firearm.Despite this, police showed up to his door and he was armed, but placed the weapon on the ground until police informed him why they were there. The man reportedly became irate, picked up the firearm and had an argument with police. The argument turned violent and shots were fired, resulting in the man’s death.According to Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, this suppression of rights has no positive tradeoffs. He said research showed that red flag laws do not stop mass shootings and negligibly reduces suicides.“No research has found any statistical reduction in crime,” said Cruz. “Including, mass shooting fatalities from confiscation laws and studies about suicide reduction show mixed results.”Despite the red flag incentives being proposed, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican leader in the negotiations, has maintained an A-Plus rating from the NRA. The gun rights organization has said they will oppose efforts to strip constitutional rights from Americans, but only once a bill is drafted outside of a framework.Along with Cornyn, nine other Republican senators, including Ohio’s Rob Portman and South Carolina’s Lindsay Graham, back the framework proposed red flag grants and all.","Sen.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:35 PM PT – Monday, June 13, 2022Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has claimed the Democrat-controlled January 6 Committee could come up with criminal charges against former President Donald Trump. The California Democrat alleged Sunday that he has “very powerful” evidence that Trump was responsible for clashes at the US Capitol.“And we’ll be presenting what we’ve found,” Schiff told reporters. “I don’t want to predetermine or prejudge the strength of what we will show you. We’ll show you what we’ve been able to determine.”This comes despite Trump saying he offered to deploy 20,000 National Guards ahead of the protest, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (R-Calif.) rejected his offer. Republicans have said Trump’s impeachment failed back in 2020 despite Schiff’s similar claims of “powerful evidence” at the time.“Well I don’t think we learnt anything new,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). “I mean, we already knew that they want to get rid of the electoral college, they want to make it so that President Trump can’t run in 2024…I don’t think we learned anything new, even with hundreds of witnesses, thousands of hours of testimony, no ability for Republicans to do any type of cross examination.”pic.twitter.com/57aYUXneGT— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) June 12, 2022Trump has also criticized the latest January 6 show trial, while asserting that it’s led by a gang of “political thugs” pursuing partisan goals.","Rep.
