8:30 AM PT",Biden invokes DPA to mass produce solar panels,"Biden invokes DPA to mass produce solar panelsWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, June 6, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:30 AM PT – Tuesday, June 7, 2022The Biden administration decided to mass produce solar panels, while Americans continue to pay record prices at the pump. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre disclosed President Joe Biden had invoked the Defense Production Act to sure up the materials needed to create the panels.Jean-Pierre claimed the move was made to advance his so-called Clean Energy Agenda. The order is also intended to increase the production of fuel cells, heat pumps and build insulation. When asked why Biden invoked the DPA, which is supposed to be reserved as a war-time measure, Jean-Pierre failed to come up with a concrete justification.“When the president takes the Defense Production Act, it’s to make sure he is delivering for the American people,” stated Jean-Pierre. “It is an important tool that he has used a couple of times and it has been incredibly effective. He is invoking the act to rapidly expand domestic production of solar panel parts.”Many critics were concerned with the benefits communist China stands to gain from the solar panel production. The global titan has dominated the solar panel supply chain for years with many components originating in China. Additionally, a large portion of the world’s Polysilicon, which is also used to produce solar panels comes from the Xinjiang province. This is where China has been accused of committing a genocide against Uighur Muslims. Jean-Pierre brushed off concerns and said China is not a variable in the White House’s plan.“Today’s announcement is about one country and one country only,” she declared. “It’s about the United States.”Furthermore, Biden’s move grants a two-year tax exemption on solar panels imported from southeast Asian countries. The topic of fossil fuels was eventually addressed during the press conference. When asked about soaring costs with no end in sight, Jean-Pierre offered no solutions, but diverted the blame away from the Biden administration.“Everything is on the table,” the press secretary voiced. “If you look at what happened when Putin started amassing troops on the border with Russia, the price of gas has increased by $1.51The White House’s statement on the matter mentioned no efforts being made to combat surging fuel prices.","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, June 6, 2022.

Pat Toomey (R-PA) leaves the Senate chamber on January 30, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:30 AM PT – Monday, June 6, 2022Republicans have lamented that the path to solving gun violence in America seems to be impossible amid an extremely partisan White House. This comes as Democrats in Washington, D.C. seem to be unwilling to lay down their partisan arms to solve the problem of gun violence.While speaking on Face the Nation Sunday, lame duck Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) lamented Biden has not been helpful in current negotiations. Toomey was tapped to be on a bipartisan group that seeks to bring forward legislation that hopes to lessen the likelihood of mass shootings. The Pennsylvania Republican stressed he and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) have advocated to expand background checks for private purchases. However, Toomey claims Biden misled voters when he campaigned on being the unifying president who would reach across the aisle.“He has sided with the far left of his party and really not reached out to Republicans,” said the GOP senator. “He gave a speech on this topic where he advocated policies that he knows for sure have no chance of passing the Senate, probably couldn’t even get 50 votes…So once again, the President is not being very helpful. I think at the end of the day, this is going to come down to whether we can reach a consensus in the United States Senate.”Expanded background checks make sense. We all agree that violent criminals and dangerously mentally ill people should not have firearms. We need a mechanism to increase the likelihood that we'll identify such a person and prevent them from buying a gun legally. pic.twitter.com/EBFymLe9OD— Senator Pat Toomey (@SenToomey) June 5, 2022Additionally, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) warned Democrats’ objective is to take guns away from law abiding citizens. The Louisiana lawmaker claimed Democrat proposals to adopt red flag laws is unconstitutional and would allow the federal government to seize firearms from individuals based on an assumption they pose a threat. He asserted that even a liberal federal court upheld the Second Amendment by striking down a bill raising the gun ownership age in California. Scalise urged lawmakers to focus their efforts on actual solutions.“We need to be focused more on stopping things before they happen,” he noted. “This isn’t something that we’re having a conversation about right now and it should be. It immediately becomes about Democrats wanting to take away guns.”Meanwhile, top officials within the Biden administration officials are trying to end mass shootings by launching a barrage of ad hominem attacks across the aisle. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg slammed Republicans for criticizing school doorways in light of the shooting in Uvalde, Texas. This comes as reports indicate a door was open at Robb Elementary School that allowed the shooter to enter and kill 21 people.“The idea that us being the only developed country where this happens routinely, especially in terms of the mass shootings, is somehow a result of the design of the doorways on our school buildings is the definition of insanity of not the definition of denial,” said Buttigieg,In the meantime, experts have warned Democrats could try to jam through gun control bills through the House while the lower chamber has a slim majority. However, they said those proposals would likely be blocked in the 50-50 Senate.","WASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 30: Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) leaves the Senate chamber on January 30, 2020 in Washington, DC.

During an interview Saturday, she argued the panel failed to address the real issue: inadequate capitol security.

In response to this, the House Republican conference chairwoman asserted that the panel is only looking to punish political opponents.Her remarks came after former White House economic advisor Peter Navarro was charged with contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before the committee. McCarthy along with congressmen Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)and Scott Perry (R-Pa.) were also subpoenaed by the panel.The American people are smart.

(AP Photo/Jeremias Gonzalez)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:28 AM PT – Monday, June 6, 2022One of the most important operations in World War II took place on June 6, 1944 One day prior, General Dwight Eisenhower approved ‘Operation Overlord’ an ambitions strategy in Normandy, France that would be the largest seaborne invasion in history.Shortly after midnight on this day in 1944, the first part of the operation was put into action in the air. Numerous American and British bombers attacked targets along the coast. In addition to that, thousands of allied paratroopers dropped into the surrounding area while other allied forces used gliders to secure key structures like bridges.In the water, minesweepers cleared the area in preparation for the landing. Then at 6:30 a.m. the first Higgins boats would hit Normandy’s shores, which were divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword Beach.""I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory."" – Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, June 6, 1944.#DDay pic.twitter.com/S8UsNVANJw— Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III (@SecDef) June 6, 2022Weather not only proved to be a challenge in the air, but in the water as well as many of the crafts were blown east of their intended positions. However, there was a greater obstacle when the allied troops made landfall. Axis opposition was heavy as the allies not only faced gunfire, but a beach strewn with obstacles.The casualties were numerous with at least 10,000 on allied side, but so too was achievement as nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day. One of those allied troops was Theodore Roosevelt Junior. At age 56, he’s believed to be oldest person to storm the beaches, but he wasn’t the only Roosevelt. His son Quentin landed at Omaha Beach.While all of the operation’s ambitious goals were not achieved on the first day, the heroic efforts of the allied forces on D-Day eventually proved vital in the European theater. In 1984, on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, Ronald Reagan said this about the brave troops that stormed Normandy on this day in 1944:“Strengthened by their courage, heartened by their value, and borne by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died…”","A World War II reenactor pays tribute to soldiers during a D-Day commemoration ceremony of the 78th anniversary for those who helped end World War II, in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, Normandy, France, Monday, June 6, 2022.

(Seth Wenig/AP Photo)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:13 PM PT – Monday, June 6, 2022Far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), once again, took to social media to disparage US institutions. In a recent Facebook livestream, the New York lawmaker accused her colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Congress of being corrupt.The Democrat pointed to the failure of the Build Back Better Act, among other progressive legislation, to pass as evidence. Additionally, Ocasio-Cortez claimed she’s not among those influenced by the depravity. However, critics have pointed out her radical policies would alter the very fabric of the country.“It’s just really wild to be a person that works in a corrupt institution, which is what Congress is,” stated the congresswoman. “And to try and be a normal person surrounded by so much decay and moral emptiness that, frankly, transcends party is very difficult.”Her online remarks came after her push to transition America’s economy into a socialist state by pushing countless radical policies that all failed. One of the main factors behind her failed efforts is that fact that inflation, which is already soaring and hurting Americans, would have continued to increase over time.It appears those in the Democrat Party are choosing to point fingers and play the “blame game” rather than take responsibility for the many issues facing the nation, such as the border crisis, continuous pain at the pump and more.

Rittenhouse spoke to Fox News on Monday, along with his attorney. He declared that he is going to “make the media pay” for it’s coverage of him.“We’re going to look at everything that’s been said,” stated lawyer, Todd McMurtry. “Then determine which of those comments are legally actionable and proceed from there.” The teen was charged in the fatal shooting of two men during the 2020 Kenosha riots. He testified that he acted in self-defense and was ultimately acquitted of all charges. Several news outlets have referred to Rittenhouse as a white supremacist and mass murderer.“Let’s just use for an example what Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg said about Rittenhouse,” McMurtry voiced. “They said that he was involved in a mass murder incident. This was not a mass murder incident. It was clearly factually false. To call somebody a mass murderer is seriously defamatory. Then to use the power of social media to basically censor any views that would take opposition to that mass murderer statement is a serious effort to destroy his character.”His attorney acknowledged the teen was charged with a crime and the media is allowed to report that, but giving him labels without evidence is clearly defamatory. He believes Rittenhouse has “10 to 15 solid” cases against “large defendants.”","KENOSHA, WISCONSIN – NOVEMBER 12: Kyle Rtttenhouse looks back as attorneys argue about the charges that will be presented to the jury during proceedings at the Kenosha County Courthouse on November 12, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

A fifth climber died before crews could reach them.“It’s 14,000 feet,” said Siskiyou County Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue. “You really need to make sure you have the appropriate equipment and also the training.”Multiple climbers were airlifted off #MountShasta Monday with serious injuries, including one fatality. We do not advise climbing the mountain the next 2-3 days due to unstable conditions. @CHP_Northern #Siskiyou #climbing #searchandrescue pic.twitter.com/9Pn1sZqCOL— Siskiyou County Sheriff (@SiskiyouSheriff) June 7, 2022The guide was leading a couple, male and a female, in Avalanche Gulch when they all fell. Eyewitnesses said one of the climbers fell about 1,000 feet. Mount Shasta rises 14,180 feet above sea level in the Cascade Range and typically has snow all year round.“What makes it dangerous right now is the change from really cold to really warm,” stated Courtney Kreider, a spokesperson for the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office. “We had snow over the weekend, just a little bit of snow, and it created this thin layer of ice in Avalanche Gulch. When it warms up, that thin layer of ice sloughs off so you have to have really good climbing gear and climbing boots that can really dig into ice.”The climbers have not yet been identified publicly. The sheriff’s office is working to notify the next of kin. Officials are blaming a fresh snowfall on the Avalanche Gulch Trail that turned to ice overnight.","A remote canyon area northeast of the town of Mariposa, seen on Wednesday, Aug. 18, 2021, is reported to be the area where a family and their dog were found dead on Tuesday, the Mariposa County Sheriff’s Office said.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, as of 2020 there are 130, 930 K-12 schools. If the federal government divided the foreign aid to Ukraine evenly among those schools each would receive just under $405,000 .Former President Donald Trump recently proposed a top-to-bottom overhaul of school safety while urging lawmakers to take back unused COVID-relief money. He pointed out that if the US has $40 billion to send to Ukraine then the government should “be able to do whatever it takes to keep our children safe at home.”President Trump comments regarding school safety n America completely opposite of bumbling Joey President Trump: ""If the United States has $40 billion dollars to send to Ukraine, we should be able to do whatever it takes to keep our children safe at home."" @dailyrealtimenews pic.twitter.com/SVK8u7TLAW— Zeke_gary2 (@ZekeGary2) May 27, 2022The 45th president went on to say, “before we nation build the rest of the world, we should be building safe schools for our own children.” Meanwhile, Republicans have lamented that the path to solving gun violence in America seems to be impossible amid an extremely partisan White House.This comes as Democrats in Washington, D.C. seem to be unwilling to lay down their partisan arms to solve the problem of gun violence. Experts have warned Democrats could try to jam through gun control bills through the House while the lower chamber has a slim majority.","An empty classroom at Yung Wing School P.S. 124 shows that a teacher has prepared for the start of the school year on September 02, 2021 in New York City.
