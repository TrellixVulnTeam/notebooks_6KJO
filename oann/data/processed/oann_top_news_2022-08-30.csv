2022-08-28,4:20 PM PT,All systems go for highly anticipated Artemis 1 mission,"All systems are a go for the highly-anticipated Artemis 1 test flight. The $37 billion Orion spacecraft is set to launch from Kennedy Space Center on Monday. The unmanned lunar rocket will take a lap around the moon to test its capabilities before returning to earth six-weeks later.This morning I had my first look at the fully assembled #Artemis1 rocket – I’m speechless! Years of dreams and exceptional hard work at @NASA have paid off – WE ARE GOING!  Launch window to the Moon opens at 08:33 ET tomorrow! Follow along: https://t.co/6mIYz4bUa5 pic.twitter.com/nBgt78ecxp— Jessica Meir (@Astro_Jessica) August 28, 2022James Free, the Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development at NASA spoke on the topic.“We have, I would say, simple but aggressive objectives, that is to get the vehicle into orbit, in orbit and back home and understand how the systems operate,” explained Free. “We need to understand how the heat shield performs on its re-entry and we need to recover the vehicle.”More than 100,000 people are expected to line Florida’s space coast to watch the launch. While there will be no crew onboard, NASA astronauts are excited for its launch because its success brings them “one giant leap” closer to a moon landing mission. If everything goes according to plan, there could be a crew flying around the moon in 2024 and a moon landing in 2025. That would be 56-years after Neil Armstrong took a giant leap for mankind.However, NASA explained that this lunar landing has a different set of objectives than Apollo 11 did.“We’re going to be sustainable this time,” Free said. “That doesn’t mean we’re staying 365 days a year. It means that we’re going to be able to stay for 30 days and help enable others to stay there while we’re not there.”The agency recently announced 13-possible landing sites on the lunar south pole for Artemis Mission 3. It would be the first-time humans have ever visited the permanently shadowed regions of the moon and it would serve as a steppingstone for future missions to Mars. NASA astronaut, Randolph Bresnik spoke on the potential mission.“If you think of going to the moon as, you know, a camping expedition and Mars being a further out camping expedition, you’re not going to go out to the Alaskan wilderness with just going to the sporting goods store and buying a tent and getting your boots that are brand new out of the box. And you’re not going to go out to the Alaskan wilderness without having tried that stuff and yet broken it in – make sure it works,” explained Bresnik. “You’re going to go to some local place. It’s a little closer that maybe, you know, you can come back pretty quickly, come back home if you’re if your shoelaces break or something like that. We’re not going to have that option when we go to Mars. It’s you know, we take everything that we need with us.”The last manned mission to the moon was Apollo 17. That mission occurred in December of 1972. So why has it taken more than half-a-century to take another “small step” back on the moon’s surface? NASA spokesperson Derrol Nail said it has much to do with previous presidential administrations and with them changing national priorities.President Obama wasted eight years that could’ve been spent getting Americans beyond low earth orbit. His cancellation of Project Constellation drew public outrage from the space exploration community, including from famous astronauts Neil Armstrong and James Lovell. Obama’s pie-in-the-sky Journey to Mars Program was seen as a last-ditch effort to save face. The “obamacare of space exploration,” was expensive, unsustainable and not designed to do what it promised.Now, the inspiration and dedication to go back to the moon and to further explore deep space has been renewed. It was advanced in hyper-speed under President Trump’s watch.","The NASA moon rocket stands ready less than 24 hours before it is scheduled to launch on Pad 39B for the Artemis 1 mission to orbit the moon at the Kennedy Space Center, Sunday, Aug. 28, 2022, in Cape Canaveral, Fla.

FDA officials claimed that the rush is necessary to ‘protect’ the population from, what they expect to be, another COVID-19 surge in the fall.The agency did not address the hundreds-of-thousands of injuries and deaths caused by COVID-19 vaccines. FDA Vaccine Chief Dr. Peter Marks spoke on the announcement.“What we’re hoping to achieve with these boosters is to restore the level of protection toward that which we saw with the original vaccines in which we not only protected against hospitalization and death, but we also protected against symptomatic disease,” explained Marks.There has been numerous cases of COVID-19 in ‘fully-vaccinated’ patients including in President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, former White House Spokesperson Jen Psaki and in a number of high-profile Democrats.","HINES, ILLINOIS – APRIL 01: A nurse administers a second COVID-19 booster shot to a patient at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital on April 01, 2022 in Hines, Illinois.

If passed, Homekey would require hotels in the city to report vacancies. From there, they would offer the vacant rooms to the homeless who have a voucher from the city. Nightly, more than 20,000 hotel rooms in the county are left empty.Many people are skeptical of this idea. They worry how guests would react to sharing their hotels with non-paying guests. Those in favor of the bill claim that it will primarily benefit seniors, students and working people despite concerns that they will be unable to screen dangerous voucher recipients.Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the city saw a 16.1% increase of people living on the streets compared to years prior. Currently, there are more than 60,000 homeless people living in Los Angeles County. This year, the number of homeless seniors has been on the rise.","A man walks past tents housing the homeless on the streets in the Skid Row community of Los Angeles, California on April 26, 2021.

Trump’s Florida residence. Barr went as far as to say that the attacks towards the FBI at a variety of their field offices have been over the top. “I think that a lot (of attacks) on the FBI are over the top because a decision like this is not going to be made by the FBI,” Barr said. “In fact, I don’t think that the FBI would come and pound the table pushing a decision like this. In this kind of situation, that it’s best to go in and search and obtain those documents after being jerked around for a year and a half, that’s the way the department would look at it, would be made at the DOJ.”While the former Attorney General admitted that the FBI was somewhat misused during the Russiagate collusion hoax, he defended the FBI director Chris Wray and he sided with him on the raid.“I think there are problems in the FBI, but it’s not Chris Wray,” said Barr. (Chris Wray) isn’t going to wake up and say ‘how do I throw the FBI’s weight around to interfere the political process?’ Just the opposite. I think he’s very cautious about that.”Barr claimed that Conservatives should give the FBI the benefit of the doubt. He also stated that it’s best to reform these government institutions.","ST LOUIS, MISSOURI – OCTOBER 15: U.S. Attorney General William Barr on October 15, 2020 in St Louis, Missouri.  (Photo by Jeff Roberson – Pool/Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1229087712-656x437.jpg, CNN Host Cooper Can’t Stack Up To OAN Alum Christina BobbTOPICS:bill barrDOJFBInewsOANOANNpoliticsRAIDRussiagateTrump SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/barr-tired-of-constant-pandering-on-the-right/

U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ordered the Justice Department to make public a redacted version of the affidavit it relied on when federal agents searched Trump’s estate to look for classified documents. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:12 AM PT – Saturday, August 27, 2022Lawmakers are outraged at the heavy redactions in the highly anticipated affidavit used to obtain a search warrant for the raid on Mar-a-Lago.20 of the 38-pages that were released on Friday were either significantly or fully redacted. However, page-19 of the affidavit may point to the can of worms that the Department of Justice (DOJ) knows it opened by ransacking the 45th President’s Florida home earlier this month.Page 19 cited a Breitbart article from May 5, 2022. That article stated that former Trump administration official, Kash Patel, said the 15-boxes of documents had already been declassified but that the classification markings had not been updated.Patel maintained that President Trump retained and declassified those documents in anticipation of leaving government. He said that Trump did this because he thought the American public should have the right to read it for themselves.“The President, by law, is the ultimate arbiter of the classification authority. If he says it, it’s declassified,” stated Patel. “It doesn’t need to go through the bureaucratic rigmarole (and) be written down in appropriate style. That’s not what the constitution says.”Patel also vocalized that reports claiming that Trump took classified information are completely false and is just another disinformation campaign against him.Trump appointed Patel alongside John Solomon in June as his representative for access to Presidential records. As the former Pentagon Chief of Staff, Patel explained that all previously classified documents have classification markings on them. This simply means they used to be classified. He added that “government simpletons” did not follow the President’s orders to have them marked as “declassified,” which he did and has the unilateral authority to do.“When these rubes get in the way because they say ‘ohh well you know so-and-so didn’t sign the letter, White House counsel didn’t do this’ that’s a farce,” remarked Patel. “And not only did the President do it by writing in October of 2020, he did it verbally at least, to the best of my recollection, multiple times in the whole sets of documents.”Patel did not go into specifics about the document, but he said they contain information on Russiagate and the Ukraine impeachment fiasco which Trump wanted the public to have access to. The former Pentagon Chief of Staff suggested that the documents may have selectively be leaked to advance a false political narrative. Patel posted a statement on Truth Social shortly after the redacted affidavit was released.From Kash Patel on Truth Social: pic.twitter.com/Upg4d7lPAv— Kristina Wong 🇺🇸 (@kristina_wong) August 26, 2022","The affidavit by the FBI in support of obtaining a search warrant for former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate is photographed Friday, Aug. 26, 2022.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:50 PM PT – Saturday, August 27, 2022New data from the CDC suggests that monkeypox cases are on the decline in the United States. While speaking at a virtual conference on Friday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said she was cautiously optimistic about these reports.“We have started to see globally that we may be turning a corner,” Dr. Walensky said. “We in the United States had our first case about two weeks after some of the European countries that we have also started to see turn around and, as you note, or turned downward. As you note, there are certain jurisdictions, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, that are starting to report that they’re starting to see a downward trend. I want to be cautiously optimistic about these, not only because of the downward trend, but because of the AMIS (American Men’s Internet Service) data that Dr. Daskalakis just noted.”However, Walensky raised concerns about the so-called racial disparities in vaccine delivery despite the Biden administration saying they will have shipped at least three-million vaccines by the end of their next phase in addressing the outbreak. She pointed to several factors which included the lack of trust in public health initiatives from the federal government among other reasons.“Now the administration data also show that among the first doses given, the majority of recipients have been adults age 25 to 39, with around 53% of first doses administered in this age group so far,” stated Walensky. “The majority of first dose recipients, 92% have been males, and 6% of doses have been administered to women. Regrettably, we at the CDC are not receiving data by gender and are unable to report it as such.”Despite this, Walensky announced that the organization will begin promoting the equitable distribution of monkeypox vaccines and will work with communities to ensure their deliveries are to those who have a high risk of contracting the virus.“Given the early evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in monkeypox vaccine administration, the CDC remains committed to reducing the impact of health disparities by collaborating with jurisdictions on provision of educational materials and promotion of equitable access to monkeypox vaccines,” the doctor said. “We’re also working with communities to provide vaccine and harm reduction education at large events attended by groups at highest risk for monkeypox right now.”So far, over 17,000 monkeypox cases have been reported in the United States. The virus mainly spreads between men who have sex with other men, but recent reports from health officials suggested that it can spread to everyone.","WILMINGTON, DELAWARE – DECEMBER 08: Dr. Rochelle Walensky, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to head the Centers for Disease Control, speaks during a news conference at the Queen Theater on December 08, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware.

Both leaders said the renewed efforts to secure Canada’s northern region comes as enemies of the West, namely China and Russia, are looking to expand a military presence in the Arctic. NATO is reportedly growing its members in the Arctic region -with experts saying the acceptance of Finland and Sweden is near. Their acceptance would mean that Russia would be the only country in the region not a part of the Western Alliance.“NATO is an Arctic alliance. Canada plays a very important part in that both with the radar sites, the NORAD the presence in the high north, but also, of course, with the advanced fighter jets, the air defense systems,” said Stoltenberg. “The… many advanced systems you have throughout Canada, which is, of course, important for the whole alliance.”So far, Canada has contributed nearly $3.5 Billion to Ukraine amid its conflict with Russia.Our support for Ukraine remains steadfast – as does our commitment to holding the Russian regime accountable.

The report found that Biden’s actions have already depleted some types of US ammunition. It also discovered that the Pentagon is not able to replenish its arsenal quickly enough. This comes as Russia controls more than 20-percent of Ukraine’s territory. Ukrainian casualties are currently mounting.Meanwhile, the United States has reportedly imported six-billion-dollars worth of goods from Russia since the conflict flared up.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:50 PM PT – Monday, August 29, 2022President Joe Biden’s Student Loan Forgiveness Plan continues to be polarizing to all, even to individuals within his own party. Progressives rejoiced at Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness announcement while vulnerable Democrats broke with the President’s decision.Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT.) praised the move that a Penn Wharton model estimated would cost taxpayers an excess of one trillion dollars over the next decade.If SoFI, a student loan refinancing company, could give its CEO a 92% raise last year paying him a grand total of $103 million in compensation and spend $625 million to put its name on the LA Rams football stadium, you know what President Biden can do? Cancel all student debt.— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 23, 2022However , during an interview on ABC this week, the Vermont Senator said the President’s plan didn’t go far enough and he called for further government subsidization of the education system.“We have got to really be thinking about higher education in general,” Sanders said. “And, in my view, at a time when hundreds of thousands of bright young people can’t even afford to go to college – if we’re going to be competitive in a global economy – we need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.”Fellow Progressive Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Sanders’s sentiments. While speaking with CNN’s Dana Bash, Warren expressed that she believed the debt transference was justified because of the surging cost of higher education in the United States. However, Warren’s statements failed to address why universities demand such a high price tag.“Our public education system is no longer creating opportunities for kids like me and other kids whose families can’t afford to write a check,” Warren said. “Instead, we’re saying to these young people ‘you’ve got to get an education but we are gonna wrap the chains of debt around you.’”A direct correlation can be drawn between federal subsidization of student loans and tuition costs. The 1992 Higher Education Reauthorization Act ensured loans directly from the Department of Education to borrowers. Between 1993 and 2006 tuition at public universities rose 47-percent.Not all Democrats are supportive of further government investments into student debt. A number of Democrats in swing state races, such as Representatives Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) and Sharice Davids (D-Kan.)  as well as Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.)  have come out in opposition to the bill. The lawmakers have claimed that the move will help well-to-do Americans while failing to address the cost of education.Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who served under both President Obama and President Clinton, has argued that forgiveness will encourage institutions to raise tuition.“I did not support large-scale student debt relief,” says @LHSummers in regards to President Biden's recent decision. “It does add to demand, which does increase inflationary pressures, but that's something that the Fed should be able to offset” https://t.co/5z9NOOERJl pic.twitter.com/DyX1v6AdmU— Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) August 26, 2022Former Top Advisor to President Bill Clinton, Paul Begala, expressed outrage that the White House would unfairly distribute funds into the hands of the educated at the expense of the lower class.“Why is my party doing with this?” Begala questioned. “They’re disadvantaging. I think they’re not helping people we’re here to help which is poor people and underprivileged communities and they’re not helping their politicians who are running.”Currently, 87-percent of American adults do not have student loans. 58-percent of all student debt is held by the wealthiest 40-percent of Americans.The Biden administration has defended student loan forgiveness by conflating it with Paycheck Protection Program loans, which the government dispersed to employers in order to retain their employees after forcing them to shut down during the COVID-19 lockdowns.","President Joe Biden speaks about student loan debt forgiveness in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022, in Washington.

The death toll in Afghanistan rose to 192 this month. The large number of deaths prompted the Taliban administration to appeal for help from the international community.The flooding marks the latest in a string of natural disasters. Recent natural disasters include a drought and an earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people in June. Qalandar Ebad, the Minister of the Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan spoke on the recent disasters.“Following the recent earthquakes and floods in the country, we encountered various diseases, the reason for which is the lack of clean drinking water, and other diseases such as pneumonia, which many children are affected by, and the reason is the change in climate and temperature,” Ebad said.The nation has been largely cut off from foreign financial systems ever since the Taliban took control a year ago.","People collect their belongings from their damaged homes after heavy flooding in the Khushi district of Logar province south of Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, Aug. 21, 2022.

In the letter, the Senators referred to the briefing as unnecessary and said it was done at the behest of Democrats in order to falsely peddle the idea that Republican investigations were promoting Russian disinformation.Their request comes one day after Sen. Johnson spotlighted a whistleblower’s allegation. The whistleblower claimed that agents were told by the FBI that they did not need to prioritize Hunter’s laptop in the weeks leading up the to 2020 presidential election because the bureau was “not going to change the outcome of the election again.”According to new whistleblower allegations, local FBI leadership told employees, “you will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop.” Read more about these revelations and my letter to the DOJ IG here:https://t.co/qn4zSj7pAU pic.twitter.com/bfi2PkX5G8— Senator Ron Johnson (@SenRonJohnson) August 25, 2022On Thursday, it was revealed by Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, that the FBI warned Facebook of an imminent “dump” of “Russian propaganda” shortly before the Hunter Biden “laptop from hell” story broke.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 5:18 PM PT – Sunday, August 28, 2022After President Joe Biden declared Republicans to be “semi-fascist,” leading Democrats have been either silent or supportive of his remarks.Recently when speaking to Democrats, Biden not only said that the 74-million Americans who voted for former President Donald Trump were threatening to democracy and he declared that those individuals are on a path to “semi-fascism.”In years past, that type of rhetoric about half of America’s voters would give party leaders a pause. In 2016, Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton made a campaign defining statement by referring to half of Trump’s supporters, or about a quarter of voters, as being “in a basket of deplorables.” Many Democrats at the time criticized Clinton and she was later forced to backtrack on the comments.However, now Democrats have stayed silent on the heating up of rhetoric against their fellow citizens even if they don’t outright support it. DNC chair Jaime Harrison was asked if he embraced the label. He said his party’s leader was just calling a spade a spade.“Well, it’s not about the embracing – its calling what it is what it is, in the end of the day, we are a country built on freedom. And when you chip away at that, when you see the bullying that takes place in place like Florida with DeSantis,” Harrison said.Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said something similar, although she more closely matched Biden’s rhetoric.“You look at the definition of fascism and you think about what they are doing in attacking our democracy, what they’re doing in taking away our freedoms, taking away, wanting to take away our rights, our voting rights. I mean, that is what that is,” Jean-Pierre said.On the other side of the aisle, there are some Republicans demanding that President Biden apologizes for his inflammatory statement. Moderate New Hampshire Governor, Chris Sununu, referred to the Presidents remark as insulting.“Horribly insulting. I mean the fact that the President would just go out and insult half of America, because effectively half of America votes Republican and half of America ultimately votes Democrat.” Sununu continued, “It’s horribly inappropriate and insulting, and people should be insulted by it and he should apologize.”While that type of rhetoric coming from Biden and its defense by other party leaders is new, the Democrats have been trending in the direction of ratcheting it up ahead of the midterms.After the 2020 election and the January sixth protests, far left Democrats have declared the Republican party to be a fascist and white supremacist movement. A notable Democrat who has spoken out is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).“If we fail to remove a white supremacist president who incited a white supremacist insurrection, it’s communities like Missouri’s first district that suffer the most,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “Well, you know I do think that fascistic tendencies, and we certainly saw a lot of fascist sympathizing.”Now that the sentiment has gone all the way to the top of the Democrat party, it remains to be seen how it could benefit or hurt them in the November elections.","President Joe Biden talks with reporters before he boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Friday, Aug. 26, 2022, as he heads to Delaware for the weekend.
