4:40 PM PT",WH Press Secy. questioned on protesters accosting,"The White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was grilled by a reporter on the White House’s stance on abortion rights protesters accosting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at a restaurant this week. Pierre said “it’s ok” for abortion rights protesters to accost Supreme Court justices.During a Friday press conference, she was asked by Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy if President Joe Biden found it appropriate for protesters to “intimidate Supreme Court justices when they’re out to eat.” Pierre asserted that the administration condemns the intimidation of judges and added that the administration had drawn the line as to which actions against judges would be permitted. She noted that protesters organizing outside of restaurants was well within the guidelines. Her response lead Doocy to push the issue further. He questioned if there was anywhere where she doesn’t think it’s appropriate to go.“We have been pretty clear on this,” Pierre stated. “The president has been very clear that we condemn any intimidation of judges in this specific question here. He has signed legislation making sure they have the protection that they need.”The secretary once again sidestepped the question and asserted that the administration condemned ”intimidation” but noted that demonstrators should be permitted to peacefully protest anywhere.“If protesters know a justice is out to eat at a restaurant then they can go and protest as long as they are what you consider peaceful?” Doocy questioned.“Well we have said that what we want to see is peaceful protest,” the secretary voiced. “That’s what we have said. We want to see protests that are peaceful but when it comes to intimidation that is something we have condemned.”The reporter went on to ask whether justices were afforded the same rights to privacy as anyone else. He questioned whether the protesters even had the right to be there.“People have the right, this is what a Democracy is,” she said. “Of course. People have a right to privacy, but they also have a right to be able to protest peacefully.”Karine Jean-Pierre on Brett Kavanaugh being forced out of a DC restaurant by protesters over his opinion:""This is what a democracy is."" pic.twitter.com/A8bsOXNXuc— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 8, 2022Doocy was unsatisfied with Pierre’s response and questioned whether allowing protesters to follow justices around could potentially create a dangerous situation for them. He also claimed that protesters would likely ”be angry.” The White House Press Secretary went on to repeat her previous answer to the reporter.The discourse comes after Kavanaugh was forced to escape through a back door of a restaurant in Washington.","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre listens to a question during a press briefing at the White House, Tuesday, July 5, 2022, in Washington.

This time he spoke about his relationship with the late Arizona Republican John McCain.At a recent Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony McCain was posthumously honored. Biden claimed he is the reason McCain ran against Barack Obama and himself for the presidency. He also said he hated running against McCain and claimed he never said a bad word about the Arizonian.“I will admit to my Democratic friends I’m the guy who encouraged John to go home and run for office,” Biden stated. “For real, because I knew what incredible courage, intellect and conscience he had.”I am very pleased to see President Biden is honoring my dear friend John McCain with the Medal of Freedom.John dedicated his life to fighting for freedom, democracy, and human rights.  There is no more deserving recipient of this honor.

McCain’s award was presented to his widow Cindy McCain who currently serves as the US Ambassador to the UN Agencies in Rome.“We ran against each other, which I didn’t like, on tickets for the highest office in the land,” he said. “I was a candidate for vice president, he was the candidate for president. I never stopped admiring John. Never said a negative thing about him in my life because I knew his honor, his courage, and his commitment.”However, Biden allegedly called McCain a “angry man” who wanted to “take the low road to the highest office in the land” on the 2008 campaign trail.","President Joe Biden posthumously awards the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to Sen.

(AP Photo/John Locher)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:40 PM PT – Saturday, July 9, 2022Former President Donald Trump discussed law and order at his “Save America” rally in Nevada.“A bunch of real winners, that’s what we need,” Trump said. “That’s what our country needs.”The desert sky above Las Vegas glowed a little brighter Friday night as the Trump train pulled into Treasure Island Hotel and Casino for a “Save America” rally. He started off the night by paying tribute to former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe who was assassinated Friday morning.“Prime Minister Abe was a friend of mine and an ally,” he voiced. “We will miss him greatly.”Trump drew inspiration from Abe’s assassination to focus on the topic of law and order. He claimed that civilization itself is under siege, noting that 16 cities set an all-time homicide record just last year.“In Democrat run cities these people are leaving,” President Trump uttered. “Is that a good way to live?”Though he said it might be controversial, Trump’s call for stiffer penalties for drug traffickers and cop killers was well received. He described Biden’s America as a cesspool of violent crime.“We must also have the death penalty for those and human trafficking,” he stated. “Babies are being killed, women are being shot in the face and being raped. Elderly women are being raped. Children are being stabbed, disfigured.Thank you to President Trump, @LVPPA, @JoeLombardoNV,  @AdamLaxalt, and Tom Homan for a wonderful discussion last night on how to make Nevada safer.Democrats are defunding the police and releasing dangerous criminals into our communities.

Morton’s Steakhouse when he was confronted by pro-choice protesters. The justice was forced to leave through the back door.“Honorable Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh and all of our other patrons at the restaurant were unduly harassed by unruly protestors while eating dinner at our Morton’s restaurant,” a Morton’s spokesperson told Politico in a statement. “Politics, regardless of your side or views, should not trample the freedom at play of the right to congregate and eat dinner. There is a time and place for everything. Disturbing the dinner of all of our customers was an act of selfishness and void of decency.”The six conservative justices targeted by ShutDownDC formed the majority that voted to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v.

On Wednesday evening, the massive storm moved over Goshen and Fayetteville. The storm leveled buildings and left tens of thousands without power.The National Weather Service determined that the tornado touched down at 3:06 p.m. and remained on the ground until 3:14 p.m. The NWS also said the tornado’s maximum wind speed was 130 mph and its path length was 4.5 miles. As the tornado approached Goshen it strengthened rapidly and grew to about 750 yards in width.As of Friday, nearly 10,000 people in the region are still without power. Ohio Governor Mike Dewine surveyed the damage in Goshen and said the destruction showed how fragile life truly is.“It brings home to all of us how fragile life is and how in one minute the world can fundamentally change,” voiced Dewine. “That’s what’s happened to the people’s whose homes have been lost or homes have been destroyed.”Yesterday, I visited Goshen Township in Clermont County to survey tornado damage and talk with local residents and community leaders.

On Friday, a state judge said she cannot extend a restraining order on the state’s so-called “trigger law” imposed by a judge in New Orleans after Roe was overturned.The court has denied the request to extend the temporary restraining order in New Orleans. Abortion is again banned in Louisiana.— Emily Woodruff (@emily_woodruff_) July 8, 2022The decision came the same day President Joe Biden issued an executive order to protect access to abortion in states where it is still legal and mitigate the potential penalties women seeking the procedure may face after the high court’s ruling on June 24.Abortion rights advocates in numerous states have filed court challenges to laws restricting the procedure. In Mississippi, home of the case that led to the Supreme Court decision, attorneys for the state’s sole abortion clinic filed a petition on Thursday asking the state’s highest court to temporarily block a new law that bans most abortions. The attorneys made the request on the day the law took effect and two days after a Mississippi judge rejected the same request.Legal experts said this gives the state a green light to enforce its near-total abortion ban. However, Louisiana’s Attorney General Jeff Landry lamented that judges are punting the decision to other districts.“If they continue to operate, they do so under their own risk,” Landry said.Speaking after the court hearing today, @AGJeffLandry tells people who disagree with Louisiana’s abortion ban that they can move to another state pic.twitter.com/UFbdc3q3qG— Sam Karlin (@samkarlin) July 8, 2022Landry went on to vow that he will fight legal challenges to the state’s abortion ban in any court he’s sent to.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:21 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022The Los Angeles Department of Elections determined the petition to recall District Attorney George Gascon has enough signatures to trigger an election. In a press release Saturday, the voter registrar stated the raw count of recall petition signatures was 715,833. A total of 567,000 valid signatures are needed to trigger a recall which the department will verify by a random sample of the signatures turned in by petition organizers.“As authorized in the California Elections Code, the RR/CC will use the random sampling technique for the verification of petition signatures,” said Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan. “The random sample is 5 percent of the total number of signatures submitted. Based on the random sampling results the petition will be certified as sufficient, require verification of all signatures submitted, or certified as insufficient. If the petition meets the sufficiency requirement the RR/CC must certify sufficiency to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors at its next regular meeting.”The earliest a recall election could take place is November 8 in a general election that includes runoff races for Los Angeles city mayor and county sheriff, as well as congressional midterms. If it’s put to a vote more than 50 percent of voters would have to vote to oust Gascon.“The concept that these changes were made solely because of the outside pressures, I know it may appear to be that way, but I can tell you it’s much more nuanced than that,” voiced Gascon. “Frankly, regardless of where the recall goes, there will be additional adjustments.”BREAKING: Los Angeles Voter Registrar (Dept of Elections) has determined the raw count of recall petition signatures to be 715,833 , way above the threshold for recall.

On his first day in office, Gascon barred prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, trying juveniles as adults and filing sentencing enhancements. This increased the amount of prison time a defendant will face in certain situations, including if they use a gun in the commission of a crime.An attempt to recall Gascon failed last year when the recall campaign was unable to garner enough signatures on a petition to put the issue to voters.","Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon in San Francisco, California.

His remarks on Sunday, come in wake of a mass shooting in Highland Park where a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens of others during a Fourth of July parade.According to Rep. Bob Morgan (D-Ill.), “everything is on the table.” Morgan was marching in the Highland Park parade on Monday with his wife, 4-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son when the dozens of shots rang out just two blocks away. The Deerfield Democrat said he ran toward the scene and is grappling with the traumatic aftermath of the bloodshed.“If anyone’s going to reject any single solution, well they’re going to hear about that from me,” Morgan said. “And so, everything has to be on the table and we have to look at this as a comprehensive problem because it really is a comprehensive problem.”The gun epidemic is not just a Chicago or an Illinois problem.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:05 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022President Joe Biden defended his upcoming meeting with Saudi leaders despite outcry from critics. In a Washington Post op-ed allegedly written by Biden, the president asserted his commitment to upholding human rights.However, he argued that he has to position America to take on Russia and China. He claimed bolstering ties with Saudi Arabia will help do that. The Saudi Royal Family, especially crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman have been suspected of aiding the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the recent mass executions of political prisoners.“I know that there are many who disagree with my decision to travel to Saudi Arabia,” Biden said. “My views on human rights are clear and long-standing. Fundamental freedoms are always on the agenda when I travel abroad as they will be during this trip, just as they will be in Israel and the West Bank.”Additionally, critics have condemned Biden’s recent attempts to reach out to the Saudi government to beg for oil exports amid his war with American energy companies. Biden said the Middle East he will be visiting is more stable and secure than the one his administration inherited 18 months ago.“As president, it is my job to keep our country strong and secure,” he voiced. “We have to counter Russia’s aggression. We have to put ourselves in the best possible position to outcompete China and work for greater stability in a consequential region of the world. To do these things we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes. Saudi Arabia is one of them and when I meet with Saudi leaders my aim will be to strengthen a strategic partnership going forward that’s based on mutual interests and responsibilities, while also holding true to fundamental American values.”Biden will be the first president to fly from Israel to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. He claimed his travels will be a small symbol of the budding relations and steps toward normalization between Israel and the Arab world, which his administration has worked to deepen and expand.He is expected to visit Saudi Arabia on Friday during his tour of the middle east.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, July 8, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:30 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022A new study from Italian researchers find that COVID booster vaccines are less than 20 percent effective in combating the virus. The recent study also found that vaccines are less than 25 percent effective against symptomatic disease after only a few months. It directly contrasts between what Doctor Anthony Fauci and other top scientific researchers have said. They claimed that boosters were 75 percent effective against preventing the spread of the Omicron variant.“Our booster vaccine regimens work against omicron,” Fauci said. “At this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster.”According to White House COVID response coordinator Jeff Zients, the unvaccinated are eight times more likely to end up in the hospital and 14 times more likely to die compared with people who are fully vaccinated. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said 36 states have detected Omicron so far and the variant makes up about 3% of COVID cases nationwide.“And so the message remains clear,” Fauci voiced. “If you are unvaccinated get vaccinated and particularly in the arena of Omicron, if you are fully vaccinated get your booster shot.”Fauci said the initial two dose series is incapable of maintaining the initial standard. According to the Doctor, the booster dose was made to “keep people healthy,” but it rapidly fades to half that percentage against symptomatic illness.As of July 7, 260.3 million people have received at least one dose of a #COVID19 vaccine. Of those, 222.5 million are fully vaccinated.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:47 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022Former Chief White House Strategist Steve Bannon agreed to speak with the January 6 committee after getting permission from Donald Trump. According to reports on Sunday, Bannon will testify before the Democrat committee after Trump waived his executive privilege in a letter sent on Saturday.“When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked executive privilege,” Trump wrote. “However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated, having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees and all of the trauma you must be going through for the love of your country. Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive executive privilege for you.”A separate letter from Bannon’s attorneys said the former Trump aide prefers a public hearing before the committee. This after the Democrat-run panel issued a number of subpoenas to top Trump administration officials, which Republicans said are unfair and political.“This allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,” he continued. “As per the request of the Unselect Committee of political thugs and hacks who have allowed no due process, no cross-examination and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present or interviewed.”This letter comes only weeks before Bannon was scheduled to be tried for contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the subpoena in the first place. The Committee has long been seeking to obtain testimony from Bannon since issuing the subpoena in September 2021.Trump’s letter to Bannon.The Legend writes the Honey Badger… pic.twitter.com/7EwriUIm3S— Steve Cortes (@CortesSteve) July 10, 2022“Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy the lives of so many and cause such great harm to our Country? It has been from the time I came down the escalator at Trump Tower, a political hit job against the overwhelming majority of Americans who support the concept and policy of Making America Great Again and putting America First. Good luck in all of your future endeavors,” the former president concluded.Bannon was not working with the Trump administration at the time of the Capital riot on January 6. The Committee claimed that Trump’s invocation of executive privilege was invalid. Trump said the January 6 committee is a partisan effort that serves no legislative purpose.","FILE – Former White House strategist Steve Bannon speaks with reporters after departing federal court on Nov. 15, 2021, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:20 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022A political insider revealed that disgraced former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) sought the advice of his friend and former President Bill Clinton in 2021 on how to spin sexual misconduct allegations.Cuomo was subject to a state sexual harassment probe following accusations by 11 women who worked for the governor. Democrat strategist Lis Smith revealed that Cuomo had not garnered sympathy from advisors following claims of sexual harassment. The allegations included a range of inappropriate behavior including that he alluded to wanting to engage in sexual relations with a young female staffer, forced kissing, unwanted sexual advances and more.The exception was Bill Clinton who had been accused of sexual harassment himself. He advised Cuomo to deny allegations and continue his term. Within a week of the allegations, Cuomo ended up announcing his resignation with two weeks notice. He has yet to run for office since then.“The sole exception was former President Bill Clinton who told him that he needed to go out and address the people of New York directly to state that his fate was in their hands not the politicians,” Smith wrote. “The consensus among advisers was that unless Clinton, with his legendary political skills, was willing to do the mea culpa himself, it would do more harm than good.”The former president had been impeached in 1998 for lying under oath about the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate and continued to serve out the remainder of his second term.","FILE – New York Gov.

The incident was surprising given Japan’s strict gun legal guidelines and very low charge of gun violence in the nation.Trump reminisced on his friendship with the former prime minister at a Nevada rally on Friday. He expressed his appreciation to Abe for being the first foreign leader to acknowledge his win in 2020. The two leaders shared numerous phone calls, visits to each others nations and several golf games.“He was a great man,” he voiced. “He was a great leader. He loved his country and he loved our country. We did incredible deals together. We made a new deal with Japan. Japan had a one-sided deal and he brought back some fairness because we had just a terrible group of trade deals with Japan. We renegotiated it. He was a real friend of mine. He really was a distinguished, incredible person.”Trump also called for a “steep price” to be paid by the gunman who killed Abe. Trump called Abe’s death “bad news for the world.”“We have some very good leaders now in Japan who really were put in place to a certain extent by Shinzo,” he said. “You know, Shinzo gave the blessing to your leaders right now. But to lose him is very hard to ever make up. He was really unique.”Donald Trump on the assassination of Shinzo Abe:“His assassination is not only a grievous atrocity, it is a devastating loss for the entire world.
