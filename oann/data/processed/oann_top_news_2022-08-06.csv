In a press briefing Thursday, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra called on Americans to take Monkeypox seriously as the US posted more than 7,000 cases. The disease has been spreading in the US since May and cases are expected to continue to rise.In light of evolving circumstances on the ground, I am declaring a public health emergency on #monkeypox. We are prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus. We urge every American to take monkeypox seriously.‚Äî Secretary Xavier Becerra (@SecBecerra) August 4, 2022He added that the emergency designation allows the government to accelerate the distribution of Monkeypox vaccines. The Biden administration also appointed FEMA officials to coordinate the Moneypox response. This comes after California, New York and Illinois designated Monkeypox a health emergency which prompted calls to do the same on the federal level. A public health emergency opens up funding for disease response and could help accelerate access to¬†existing treatments¬†for the painful disease. Monkeypox vaccines already exist and are in use around the country, but they‚Äôre still in¬†short supply.The declaration follows the World Health Organization announcement last month that Monkeypox is a public health emergency of international concern. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as ‚Äúan extraordinary event‚Äù that constitutes a ‚Äúpublic health risk to other States through the international spread of disease‚Äù and ‚Äúto potentially require a coordinated international response.‚Äù‚ÄúThis public health emergency will allow us to explore different strategies to get vaccines and treatments more quickly out to impacted communities and it will allow us to get more data from jurisdictions so we can effectively track and attack this outbreak,‚Äù stated Robert Fenton, White House national Monkeypox response coordinator.The Administration has announced a four-part strategy to combat monkeypox, including:‚Äì Scaling production and distribution of vaccines‚Äì Making testing more convenient‚Äì Expanding access to treatments‚Äì Empowering communities impacted or at risk of contracting the virus‚Äî The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 4, 2022HHS recently said it‚Äôs adding 800,000 doses of Monkeypox vaccines to its stockpile amid calls for mass-vaccination for Monkeypox among the gay circles.

During a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell called for changes to the bail system to make it easier to keep repeat offenders behind bars.‚ÄúThis is not attacking some of the needed reforms that we have,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúThis is about a small number of people that are taking advantage of the existing laws to endanger our city.‚ÄùAccording to officials, the number of individuals arrested three or more times in a calendar year for crimes such as robbery, burglary and grand larceny has increased through the first six months of 2022.

His career of 101 arrests includes 88 busts since the bail laws took effect.

During a press conference Thursday, DeSantis said Warren has continued to ignore the law and his suspension is effective immediately.DeSantis said crime has spiked under the 13th Judicial Circuit in Hillsborough County because prosecutor Warren picks and choosea what laws to enforce based on his personal agenda.¬†Warren recently signed a joint letter promising to avoid prosecuting people for providing or seeking abortions. The letter was published in June by the organization Fair and Just Prosecution, which bills itself as bringing together elected local prosecutors to promote ‚Äúa justice system grounded in fairness, equity, compassion and fiscal responsibility.‚Äù‚ÄúThe role of the state attorney is to apply the law and enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws you like and which laws you don‚Äôt like,‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúThis is a law and order state. We‚Äôre not going to back down from that one inch. We‚Äôre not going to allow locally-elected people to veto what our state has decreed through our legislative process. When you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre not going to enforce certain laws that you don‚Äôt like, that‚Äôs neglect of duty that quite frankly is incompetence as defined in Florida law.‚ÄùWarren signed the letter along with more than 90 prosecutors from various states, some of which have enacted limitations on abortion similar to the Florida measure. The Florida Legislature passed the 15-week abortion restriction this spring, and DeSantis signed it in April. Providers could face third-degree felony charges for breaking the law.‚ÄúNot all of us agree on a personal or moral level on the issue of abortion. But we stand together in our firm belief that prosecutors have a responsibility to refrain from using limited criminal legal system resources to criminalize personal medical decisions,‚Äù the June 24 letter said. ‚ÄúAs such, we decline to use our offices‚Äô resources to criminalize reproductive health decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions.‚ÄùProsecutors have a duty to enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws they agree with.

While the White House touted the strike on ‚ÄùAl-Qaeda‚Äù leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri at a compound in Afghanistan, Republicans said its only indicative of Afghanistan being a hotspot for terrorists in the region. In a press conference Tuesday, White House National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby asserted the White House ‚Äùmet its commitment‚Äù in regards to controlling terrorist activity in the country.‚ÄúAs President Biden has consistently said, we will not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists who might bring harm to Americans, to the homeland,‚Äù said Kirby. ‚ÄúWe met that commitment. This action demonstrates that without American forces on the ground in Afghanistan and in harm‚Äôs way, we still remain able to identify and locate even the world‚Äôs most wanted terrorist and then take the action to remove him from the battlefield.‚ÄùNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan added onto Kirby‚Äôs statement and said Al-Zawahiri‚Äôs death has ‚Äúundoubtedly made the United States safer.‚Äù Sullivan noted that the killing of the terrorist justified Biden‚Äôs‚Äô withdrawal from Afghanistan last year and asserted that the US no longer needed to keep thousands of troops there.‚ÄúHe was the man who was the most inspirational figure, the strategic leader, someone who sent guidance regularly to affiliates around the world,‚Äù Sullivan voiced. ‚ÄúSomeone who sent out messages inspiring his followers to attack and kill Americans and harm the United States. Someone who tried to hold together a global network of terrorists that could continue to threaten both America and Americans and taking him out has undoubtedly made the United States safer.‚ÄùOn July 1, President Biden meets with his national security team to discuss the counterterrorism operation to take out Ayman al-Zawahiri. At this meeting, the President was briefed on the proposed operation and shown a model of the safe house where Al-Zawahiri was hiding. pic.twitter.com/W0A0mDk9Lr‚Äî The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 2, 2022The White House‚Äôs sentiments contrast those of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who pointed to the fact that Al-Zawahri felt safe enough to stay in Kabul and showed the US lack of control of terrorist activities in Afghanistan.‚ÄúI want to focus for a minute on the successful strike against Al-Zawahri,‚Äù McConnell stated. ‚ÄúOur professionals did an extraordinary job. Congratulations to them, but I think it‚Äôs also important to remember that about a year ago, we pulled out of Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban was out of power and Al-Qaeda was not around. So it is noteworthy where Al-Zawahiri was in Kabul. So Al-Qaeda is back as a result of the Taliban being back in power and describing the current situation in Afghanistan as success is utterly absurd.‚ÄùThe targeted CIA attack raised questions about the presence of Al-Qaeda which was supposedly purged from the country. There were many questioning whether the Taliban was providing refuge to the group behind numerous attacks against America, including 9-1-1.Al-Zawarhiri was accused of planning the September 11 attacks as well other bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990‚Äôs, among other attacks.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,¬†Biden Admin.

Speaking at the event on Thursday, Orban accused progressive liberals of trying to silence him and attempting to keep him away from the event.‚ÄúThey did not want me to be here and they made every effort to drive a wedge between us,‚Äù said Orban. ‚ÄúThey hate me and slander me and my country as they hate you and slander you and the America you stand for. We all know how this works. Progressive liberals didn‚Äôt want me to be here because they knew what I would tell you. Because I‚Äôm here to tell you that we should unite our forces.‚ÄùHe then went on to suggest that today‚Äôs progressive left is equivalent to Nazi‚Äôs and communist dictators by trying to move the US away from Judeo-Christian values. Orban, who came to power in 2010, has increasingly clamped down on political opposition and press freedom, consolidating his power further over the last two elections.¬† During his speech, Orb√°n also attacked Jewish billionaire George Soros, former President Barack Obama, ‚Äúglobalists‚Äù and the Democratic Party. He went on to voice, ‚ÄúThey hate me and slander me and my country, as they hate you.‚Äù‚ÄúThe horrors of Nazis and communism happened because some western states in continental Europe abandoned their Christian values,‚Äù he voiced. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs progressives are planning to do the same. They want to give up on western values and create a new world, a post-western world. Who is going to stop them if we don‚Äôt?‚Äùüá≠üá∫ü§ùüá∫üá∏PM Orb√°n opens @CPAC calling for conservatives to unite forces & fight for a bright(er) future in the West.

Politics, my friend, are not enough. This war is a culture war. We have to revitalize. We have to revitalize our churches, our families, our universities and our community institutions.‚ÄùA day before his appearance at CPAC, Orb√°n and his delegation met with former President Donald Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Szijj√°rt√≥ also commented in a tweet that Hungarian-US relations were ‚Äúat their peak when Donald Trump was President‚Äù and expressed the hope that he‚Äôll be president again. .45: Great spending time with my friend, Viktor Orb√°n, the Prime Minister of Hungary.

Speaking to the media from the White House Friday, Biden appeared optimistic about securing her release.‚ÄúWe call on President Biden and the United States government to redouble their efforts to do whatever is necessary and possible,‚Äù the Rev.

Her sentencing could now pave the way for a prisoner swap between Griner and Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in Illinois. The result is a painful quandary for the Biden administration as it tries to maintain a hard line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over his war in Ukraine.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing good here,‚Äù said Andrea Schneider, an expert on international conflict resolution at Cardozo School of Law. ‚ÄúNo matter what Biden does, he‚Äôs going to be criticized.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:14 AM PT ‚Äì Friday, August 5, 2022The Biden administration has paired up with Big Business to promote its latest social spending bill. The President said a Democrat-backed spending binge will combat inflation, but hundreds of economists disagree.On Thursday, Joe Biden held a virtual conference with representatives of large businesses and labor unions to promote his so-called Inflation Reduction Act. He claimed the mega corporations had American families‚Äô best interests at heart by putting their weight behind the bill. The Delaware native touted the multiple ways he alleged Americans will save money from health care to effects from the so-called climate crisis.‚ÄúThe Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug prices, lowers health insurance premiums, invests in clean energy that will create jobs and economic opportunities for business and labor, reduces the deficit, and makes common sense reforms to our corporate tax code,‚Äù claimed the President. ‚ÄúThese are the facts‚Äù.Biden praised the bill in tandem with the recently passed CHIPS Act, which the Democrat proclaimed would bolster clean energy investments and American manufacturing.‚ÄúThey see how already because of our work over the last 18 months, American manufacturing is coming back stronger than ever,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúWhere is it written that America can‚Äôt lead the manufacturing in the world? Six-hundred, thirteen-thousand manufacturing jobs created just since I took office, the most created in three decade.‚ÄùWhen we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, working families will get rebates to buy efficient appliances and weatherize their homes. And folks will have tax credits for efficient heating and cooling and rooftop solar.Families will see their energy bills drop by the hundreds.‚Äî President Biden (@POTUS) August 5, 2022However, analysts are less optimistic about the bill than Mr. Biden. Two-hundred, thirty economists penned a letter to House and Senate leadership warning the spending package will serve as gasoline for red hot inflation. The economists warned the spending tax hikes will serve as a one-two punch to the economy, boosting demand while handicapping supply.Furthermore, they asserted the suggested minimum corporate tax rate would suffocate a supply chain on life support, while medical price controls will stifle innovation. In a subsequent interview with Fox‚Äôs Larry Kudlow, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called the bill a ‚Äúcomplete fraud‚Äù because it will fail to attack inflation, while serving as shrapnel to taxpayers and businesses.‚ÄúThat the subsidies to Obamacare include people $304,000 a year,‚Äù Graham noted. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like helping the poor and it also says the 15 percent minimum in tax that you described will create distance to build factories, buy equipment during a recession. Now who in the right mind wants to tax and spend during a recession?‚ÄùDemocrats, however, shot back at the bill‚Äôs skeptics by producing a letter signed by 126 economists in support of the spending binge. The bill‚Äôs ambitions were once thought to be extinguished until Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) came to an agreement on the measure with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) With Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) vocalizing her support for the legislation, it‚Äôs almost certain to pass through reconciliation.","FILE ‚Äì President Joe Biden speaks about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022.
