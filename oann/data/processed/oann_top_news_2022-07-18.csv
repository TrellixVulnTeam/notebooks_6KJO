(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:12 PM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022A new suicide prevention lifeline is launching nationwide. Starting Saturday, the code 988 will be available for call or text as the Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline. The line will remain open around the clock and anyone who wants to talk about their struggles can speak to a trained counselor.“Our goal is to make 988 like 911,” Secretary Xavier Becerra said. “If you are willing to turn to someone in your moment of crisis, someone will be there. 988 won’t be a busy signal. 988 will get you help. That is the goal.” The 988 Suicide and Crisis Line launches tomorrow. Suicide is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 10 to 34. With this new, around the clock crisis line, countless lives will be saved. #988Lifeline pic.twitter.com/0mACjhQTfH— Rep. Alma Adams (@RepAdams) July 15, 2022At the same time, advocates hope the renewed focus on emergency assistance and the spending that has accompanied it will prompt expansion of other mental health services that are in desperately short supply in many communities.“I look at 988 as a starting place where we can really re-imagine mental health care,” said Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “We’re really looking at a fundamental tide shift in how we respond to people in mental health crisis.”The number of suicides in the United States rose steadily from 29,350 in 2000 to 48,344 in 2018 before declining to 45,979 in 2020, according to the National Center on Health Statistics. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and other factors, government and health officials agree that the country is in the grip of a mental health crisis, especially among younger people with sharply rising rates of depression and anxiety.The lifeline has been in operation under a ten digit number since 2005 and has reportedly taken over 20 million calls since. Officials predict those numbers are going to increase with the transition to a three digit number.","In this Sunday, Aug. 11, 2019, photo, a man uses a cell phone in New Orleans.

Biden visited Abbas in Bethlehem on Friday, where he affirmed he is still working toward a two-state solution and lasting peace between Israel and Palestinian authority.#Now: President Biden meets President Abbas in Bethlehem 🇺🇸🇵🇸 pic.twitter.com/kZ34UEZj6u— Noga Tarnopolsky (@NTarnopolsky) July 15, 2022Biden said the violence between both sides has devastated too many families and added that it is “heartbreaking” that so many Palestinians and Israelis have died this year. He acknowledged that a two-state solution will not be a reality anytime soon, but pledged to not give up on pursuing it.“There must be a political horizon the Palestinian people can actually see or at least feel,” Biden said. “We cannot allow the hopelessness to steal away the future that so many have worked toward for so long. So even if the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations, the United States and my administration will not give up on trying to bring the Palestinians and Israelis and both sides closer together.”This comes as the Biden administration announced Thursday that it is providing $316 million in additional aid to the Palestinian authority, including around $200 million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.The administration also proposed a multi-year contribution of $100 million for the East Jerusalem Hospitals Network, which provides medical care ranging from oncological care to emergency services for 50,000 local patients, though the funding would require authorization from Congress.Furthermore, Israelis are in the midst of more political chaos after the government’s collapse last month. The country is headed for its fifth election in under four years and the polls show yet another toss-up. That opens the possibility for a return to power for Benjamin Netanyahu, an antagonist to a peace deal that isn’t lopsided in Israel’s favor.","U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a joint statement with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Friday, July 15, 2022.

On Thursday, the top Democrat doubled down on her commitment to federalizing abortion policy throughout all 50 states.“A woman’s right to choose is a kitchen table issue,” Pelosi voiced. “Contraception, birth control — they are kitchen table issues.”House Democrats planned on sending a bill to codify Roe to the Senate whether it is likely to succeed or not. Pelosi proclaimed both congressional Democrats and Joe Biden support enshrining the procedure into national law and that the act is intrinsically American.“This is something that is core to who we are,” she said. “It’s about freedom. It’s about health care. It’s about respect for women and that is something that the president is wedded to.”“Catholic” Nancy Pelosi Nationwide abortion-on-demand is “core to who we are” and about ""freedom"". pic.twitter.com/lZ4GsIQzuv— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 15, 2022Pelosi promised to bring a revamped version of the Women’s Health Protection Act to the House floor, once again. This will codify several aspects of Roe into law. The bill would make abortion access a right, while removing waiting periods and bans which would provide admitting privileges to hospitals to perform the procedure.Critics of the bill have claimed it violates states’ rights as state-level restrictions would be superseded by the new law. The House originally passed the bill, only for the legislation to be shot down in the Senate in a 49 to 51 vote.  However, Pelosi has refused to compromise on the bill’s proposals to vault the 60 vote filibuster threshold.Pelosi has not given up on making Roe the law of the land, even if the bill is stifled in the Senate. The California Democrat pivoted to making an abortion based campaign pitch that encouraged Americans to vote for Democrat candidates nationwide this November.“In fewer than 100 days people will be voting,” she stated. “We have to elect a couple more Democratic senators so that we can get around the filibuster. We have great candidates. Our country is at risk.

He was treading water around 200 yards from shore when a small shark approached and nipped his ankle.

Shark deterring efforts, including the deployment of spotter drones and lifeguards on wave runners have been initiated.

He appreciates the love and will be back to work soon.”Today I will be striking out my @NHRA racing number in memory of Bobby East, I knew his dad pretty well and my USAC cars raced against him.

During an interview Saturday, Rep. Mullins said Americans are motivated to vote for Republicans amid Joe Biden’s massive failures in foreign and domestic policies.He targeted Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, his fiscal policies that led to record high inflation and gas prices as policies continue to negatively affect everyday Americans. Mullin stressed that America First warriors need to take a page out of President Trump’s playbook if they want to be an effective leader who will fight the Washington establishment.The Biden legacy: – $5 gasoline– 40 year high inflation– record crime wave– partisan witch-hunts– 3M illegal border crossings– supply chain shortages– baby formula crisis– brutal overregulation– unhinged spending– disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal– $30T national debt— Markwayne Mullin (@MarkwayneMullin) July 8, 2022“He was fighting for this country each and every day,” said Mullin. “There is not another president out there that’s took as much punishment. Even Board Magazine came out and said he’s the only president in modern history that cost him to be the president. They said his net worth dropped $680 million. That means he’s not doing it for fame and fortune. He’s doing it for the love of this country and that’s why we’re in this fight too.”The former undefeated MMA fighter went on to lambast Biden’s energy policies and said his war on American energy is going to further sink the economy. He derided Biden for stopping the oil flow from several US pipelines and rigs, adding Trump had to reverse the same actions from the Obama administration to bring down gas prices. Mullin believes if America was energy independent then energy costs would decrease rapidly, which would spillover into other products.“Biden comes in January 20 and immediately cuts that flow rate again,” he stated. “You immediately saw increase on pricing because people are competing to get the product to the refinery and away from the refinery’s because their is not enough compacity now in the pipeline. It’s a simple move like that that’s allowing the pipelines to increase capacity to what they were originally permitted for and inspected for, which would bring down the cost probably in the neighborhood of 15 percent or 20 percent.”Additionally, Mullin stressed it is imperative that Americans come out to vote this November for the America First agenda and the candidates who wave the MAGA flag follow through on their campaign promises. He asserted that the GOP needs to flip seats beyond what is needed to get a majority in the upper chamber.Mullin lamented that there are several Republicans, including Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) whose party loyalty is dubious. He added that a strong majority is needed to provide an adequate check on the Biden administration and his cabinet officials so they don’t conspire to subvert the will of the people.“We got to put a lot of pressure on these agencies,” he voiced. “These agency heads that are accountable to the Senate. We confirm them to go set in that place and that’s got to put a lot of pressure on them when they try to go outside the will of Congress and go at it on their own.”Meanwhile, Mullin is expected to face off against T.W.

He hinted that they could increase supply to the market.“This is the fastest decline rate that we’ve seen against a major increase of oil prices during a war in Europe,” he voiced. “Where one of the parties in the war is the third largest producer in the world. So these are extraordinary circumstances. We’ve taken very tough measures to address them right away. Both of the American consumer but really for global economy, too.”President Biden’s top economic priority is tackling inflation and bringing down the energy prices that account for half of it.Under @POTUS’ leadership, the price of gas has decreased for 30 days in a row, and the price at the pump has gone down by about 40 cents since mid-June.— The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 13, 2022Over the past year, fuel prices across the US surged more than 60 percent.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is “intentionally sabotaging” President Biden’s agenda. During an interview on Sunday, Sanders called out Manchin for being untrustworthy and not representing the Democratic party.Sanders claimed Manchin has been talking “nonsense” for the past year. He also claimed the West Virginia Sen. has continued to deviate from the president’s agenda by not supporting tax and climate provisions being proposed by Democrats.Manchin said he would not support provisions in the bill that increase spending to combat climate change and close tax loopholes. Democrats cannot pass the bill without Manchin’s support in a US Senate that is divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker in the event one is needed.“He has sabotaged the president’s agenda,” Sanders said. “If you check the record, six months ago I made it clear that you have people like Manchin, Sinema (D-Ariz.) to a lesser degree, who are intentionally sabotaging the president’s agenda, what the American people want, what a majority of us in the Democratic caucus want.”Joe Manchin is someone who is a major recipient of fossil fuel contributions.

A strike is still not ruled out pic.twitter.com/IgABAjXdb0— Lauren Kaori Gurley (@LaurenKGurley) July 15, 2022Union leaders said conductors and engineers have not received a raise in years despite record profits for several railroad companies. The industry has reportedly lost 20 percent of its workforce since 2017, which led to under staffing and longer hours for employees that stay.The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway is the largest Class I railroad in the country and is one of the two major freight railroads in Wyoming. It employs about 40,000 people and operates in 28 states on over 32,000 miles of track throughout its system.The railroad has been one of the major economic drivers and employers for many of the Wyoming communities it passes through. Many owe their existence to it. In February, BNSF instituted an attendance policy known as Hi-Viz, which drew immediate criticism from employees and railroad unions. Kevin Knutson is a Gillette-based conductor and union leader who has worked for the railroad for over 40 years. He said the policy is very stringent.“The attendance policy we had in the past, it would allow basically any person to take two weekend days and five weekdays per month off,” explained Knutson. “This policy that they have now, cut that in half and in half. For instance, if I took off every other Sunday, no other days, I would be dismissed by the end of the year.”BNSF said more than 50 percent of train crew employees work less than 40 hours on average.","MIAMI, FL – MAY 24: An Amtrak train is seen as people board at the Miami station on May 24, 2017 in Miami, Florida.
