Spurred by the Tuesday, May 24, 2022, deadly elementary school shooting in Texas, California senators approved giving citizens the power to sue those who traffic in illegal firearms, mimicking a Texas law that is intended to deter abortions. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:28 AM PT – Tuesday, May 31, 2022The Second Amendment is apparently up for debate in Washington, D.C. as lawmakers attempt to signal they are doing something about gun violence. On several corporate news outlets, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle put in their two cents on how to make sure another mass shooting like the one in Uvalde, Texas doesn’t happen again.While appearing on CNN, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said he would support a number of gun control measures, including banning bump stocks, AR-15’s and raising the minimum age to buy guns. He said his philosophy on gun control evolved after seeing mass shootings in Las Vegas, Parkland High School in Florida and Buffalo, New York.Kinzinger went on to flip-flop on whether he supports a full ban of so called assault weapons, while emphasizing his preferred measures as added qualifications.“You know, fairly recently, I think I’m open to a ban now,” he stated. “It’s going to depend on what it looks like because there’s a lot of nuances on what constitutes certain things, but I’m getting to the point where I have to wonder maybe for somebody to own one maybe you need an extra license, maybe you need extra training. So the question is: is it a ban or additional certification?”Meanwhile, Senate Democrat Whip and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin believes “different feeling” among his colleagues on gun reform. Durbin has claimed red flag laws could be adopted as well as a crackdown so-called “straw purchases,” where people with clean criminal records buy guns then give them to criminals. He also claimed bans on so-called assault weapons work and said the number of Americans who have AR-15s is alarming.“Well, when we had one, there was a reduction in crime, in mass shooting with these weapons,” he noted. “That expired years ago and unfortunately in the meantime, there’s been dramatic increase in purchases of these weapons. The AR-15 that was used by this individual in Uvalde, there are now 20 million of those owned by American across the nation to put it in perspective.”Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) went so far as to say mass shootings in school will dissipate when Americans love their kids more than they love their guns.“Until the redemptive power of the love for all of our children is greater than the destructive power of the love of our guns and money and power…until that until the redemptive love of our children turns into action, then nothing is going to change,” he stated.However, retired Navy SEAL, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) said many of the proposals in Washington, D.C. won’t work. He claimed establishing red flag laws attempts to enforce the law before it’s broken and questions the standards that would make a gun purchaser a “threat.” Crenshaw also challenged raising the minimum age to buy a gun by warning lawmakers will just keep raising the age limit after each mass shooting. Instead, he urged lawmakers to focus on bolstering background checks and school safety.“A lot of these policies that the Democrats often propose, these gin control policies, they do two things,” said Crenshaw. “One, they infringe of the rights of millions and millions of gun owners. And two, they probably wouldn’t have the outcome that you’re hoping for. So if you’re not going to get the benefit that you want, but it’s going to come at great costs, it generally means it’s not a good policy.”Additionally, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) urged lawmakers to look at reducing gun violence commonsensically. The Republican, who led an NRA task force, said banning specific weapons like AR-15s is tricky because lawmakers would have to distinguish problematic properties that could be found in other long guns or pistols. He added, AR-15s have been around long before they were used in mass shootings and believes lawmakers should be looking into the people behind these shootings.“I want to give a little bit more history; AR-15s were around for 40 years before they were ever used in any type of mass killing or attack,” explained Hutchinson. “And so, it is about the human heart. It is about identifying the culprits and going after them and I think it is a discussion you can have.”Legal scholar Jonathan Turley echoed this point while stressing landmark precedent, including District of Columbia v. Heller, cemented Americans’ right to keep and bear arms. Turley pointed out that Democrats push gun control legislation that fails in the courts and ends up strengthening Second Amendment protections.","FILE – An ATF agent poses with homemade rifles, or “ghost guns,” at an ATF field office in Glendale, Calif., on Aug. 29, 2017.

(AP Photo/Meg Kinnard)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:13 AM PT – Tuesday, May 31, 2022South Carolina congressional candidate Katie Arrington put incumbent Rep. Nancy Mace on blast ahead of the state’s primary election. In a recent interview, Arrington accused Mace of turning her back on 45th President Donald Trump and being a RINO.Previously, Mace blamed Trump for inciting the January 6 capitol protest and voting to certify Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election despite his support of her 2020 congressional campaign.“Since that time, Nancy has done nothing but cozy up to the Democrats and the radical left to, you know, promote her moderate, you know, liberal agenda,” Arrington asserted. “I mean, she literally is a RINO in every sense of the word and this district has had enough.”Additionally, the Trump endorsed candidate accused Mace of flip flopping on several issues such as the COVID-19 vaccine. Arrington also called her opponent desperate and claimed she was willing to say anything to get re-elected.“She goes on Fox one day to talk about how, you know, everyone should be aware of their natural own immunity and that, you know, only take the vaccine if needed,” explained the congressional candidate. “And then goes in the same outfit to CNN and says, you know, vaccine mandates mandatory and goes to MSNBC to say the same thing.”Arrington then went on to slam Mace for expressing optimism for the US under Biden despite high inflation and the current baby formula shortage.“I don’t understand where she’s coming from and what bizarro world she lives in,” Mace stated. “We have record high inflation, record high gas prices. It’s disgusting, the fact that our country has a baby formula shortage. We’re the greatest country on the planet and yet the federal government under the Biden leadership has driven it to the point where babies are going hungry in our own country, and she thinks this is optimistic.”South Carolina’s Republican primary is expected to take place on June 14.","Former South Carolina state lawmaker Katie Arrington speaks at a rally ahead of an appearance by former President Donald Trump on Saturday, March 12, 2022, in Florence, S.C.

Adm. Karl L. Schultz is being relieved by Adm. Linda Fagan as the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:23 AM PT – Wednesday, June 1, 2022President Joe Biden is reportedly upset with his administration’s handling of the highest inflation in decades. According to a Washington Post report published on Wednesday, over the past several months Biden has privately sounded off about how White House aides are not sufficiently addressing inflation.Biden was said to have told aides they are not doing enough to explain what is causing inflation and what they are doing to reduce it. The President’s reported frustration comes as recent polls indicate most Americans do not approve of his handling of inflation or the economy as a whole.Despite this, Biden administration economists have said the looming economic recession is nothing to worry about. Administration officials appear to be keeping their heads in the ground as the US economy is on its way to catastrophe. At the White House and on corporate networks Tuesday, several of President Biden’s economic advisors tried to downplay the severity of rampant inflation and chocked supply chain.Director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese echoed the long defunct talking point that the economy is in a “transitory period.” Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell blasted officials for using that term last year. At that time, he said it was too late in the game to call the crisis transitory. That didn’t stop Deese from downplaying the economic woes experienced at the hands of the Biden administration while also claiming the US economy is in a good place.“The economy we have right now is in a transition from this period of historical economic growth to a period that can be more stable, resilient growth,” he stated. “That required focusing on inflation and doing so from a position of relative strength. The US is in a better position to do so in part because of the strength of our labor market recovery, the strength of household balance sheets.”National Economic Council director Brian Deese speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, May 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)However, the numbers show the economy is not in a good place. Economists have lamented the inflation rate is at a more than 40-year high. Additionally, gas prices have soared since Biden occupied the Oval Office with national averages exceeding $4.00 and in California more than $6.00. It appears that those prices keep hitting record highs week after week. Other experts have pointed to the problems with the supply chain that is causing store shelves to run dry and is keeping baby formula from nurturing children.Recently, Powell warned Americans are going to feel some more pain while the central bank posits to fight inflation. However, the Biden administration appears to be incapable of admitting its mistakes. Instead, Biden officials have continued to blame COVID-19 and Russia’s Vladimir Putin for America’s crumbling economy.“What we understood about inflation at the time was that it was tied to the pandemic, said chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Cecilia Rouse, PH.D. “We are still in the midst of this pandemic. Russia’s war on Ukraine disabled not only gas prices and food prices, but also disrupted supply chains. We didn’t foresee Delta, we didn’t forsee Omicron. And So, yes, there have been unexpected challenges, which have disrupted getting us back to the natural equilibrium that would help bring down those prices.”There is one Biden administration official who is taking responsibility for her miscalculations. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters that she was wrong to say inflation would not snowball in several interviews last year. She admitted there were several Biden administration programs, including massive spending bills, energy cutting policiesand insufficient supply chain, that contributed to the economic crisis.However, Yellen and President Biden have said the administration is not ready to correct course and is deferring responsibility to the Federal Reserve. The Treasury secretary said the fed will have to lead the way on combatting inflation and the rest of the Biden administration will follow suit.“And for our part, President Biden is focused on supplementing what the Fed does with actions we can take to lower the costs that American face for important expenditures they have in their budgets,” Yellen stated.In the meantime, Powell has vowed to wage war on inflation until the Consumer Price Index returns the Fed’s target at 2 percent. Some economists and lawmakers warned a recession could come in the coming months if the Biden administration fails to take hold of inflation.","President Joe Biden participates in a change of command ceremony at U.S. Coast Guard headquarters, Wednesday, June 1, 2022, in Washington.

Jacob Albarado recalled his experience of rushing to the Uvalde school to save his wife and daughter.During an exclusive interview with NBC on Tuesday, Albarado said his day began with an award ceremony for his daughter, breakfast with his mom, and a car wash. Things took a turn when he sat down for a haircut at a barber shop, which wasn’t too far from his daughter’s elementary school.“My barber actually heard shots,” he said. Albarado’s wife, who is a fourth grade teacher, and his daughter, a second grader, were inside the Uvalde Elementary School as the tragic shooting unfolded. The off-duty Border Patrol agent said he did what he was trained to do and jumped into action. He said when he arrived at the school, he was armed with his barber’s shotgun. Police let him inside.“I looked for a gun,” the agent stated. “My barber said he had a gun. Both of us raced over to the school and met up there.”The agent described seeing absolute chaos with some police already there and parents trying to get into the school. According to the New York Times, his daughter was locked inside a bathroom while his wife hid under desks with her students. He eventually learned they were both safe and helped evacuate children as they climbed through windows for safety.“I was just trying to get towards my wife’s room and my daughter’s room,” Albarado voiced. “As I was going in, I could just see kids coming out the windows, kids coming my way.

On Wednesday, Abbott requested the creation of the committees through a letter addressed to Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R-Texas) and House Speaker Dan Phelan (R-Texas).“As Texans mourn the tragedy that occurred at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde last week, we as a state must reassess the twin issues of school safety and mass violence,” Abbott wrote. “As leaders, we must come together at this time to provide solutions to protect all Texans.”The committees would examine and develop legislative recommendations on school safety, mental health, police training, social media, firearm safety and more.Texas is among 14 states where only the governor has the power to call a special session. During his governorship, Abbott has ordered five special sessions to address matters, including abortion laws, COVID relief funding, a transgender sports ban, bail reform and voting laws.JUST IN — Texas Gov.

8:20 AM PT",Critics claim Canada’s handgun ban will punish law-abiding citizens,"Critics claim Canada’s handgun ban will punish law-abiding citizensCanada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces new gun control legislation in Ottawa, Ontario, on Monday, May 30, 2022. (Patrick Doyle/The Canadian Press via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:20 AM PT – Wednesday, June 1, 2022A gun shop owner in British Columbia said Canada’s hand gun ownership freeze punishes law-abiding citizens, while the government rewards criminals. Matt Mendel, the co-owner of Wanstall’s Hunting & Shooting, strongly disagrees with the sweeping declaration by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The legislation freezes the buying, selling and transfers of handguns between consenting parties until further notice. Mendel thinks the order is unlikely to decrease violence in Canada as most weapons used at crime scenes are obtained illegally. He lamented the measure will greatly reduce his sales volume, in turn, diminishing the recreational shooting industry from year-round to seasonal.“This does not do anything to address the illegal firearms that are being picked up after the scene of the crime where 82 percent of them are smuggled in coming from the United States,” explained the gun shop owner. “I think it’s a waste of resources that could be better allocated towards anti-trafficking, for example.”While addressing the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday, Conservative Party Leader Candice Bergen found it hypocritical for Trudeau’s government to punish law-abiding citizens, while simultaneously loosening repercussions for criminals.“On one hand, they’re banning handguns,” he noted. “On the other hand, they’re pushing through Bill C-5, which tells criminals, don’t worry if you’re convicted of a gun crime, you just hang out at home for your sentence. This is not keeping community safe, and it is not reassuring to moms and dads who are worried about their kids.”Bill C-5, which was proposed late last year, removes minimal sentencing for a number of gun-related crimes, excluding the usage of a firearm in connection to a criminal organization. Trudeau, however, doubled down on his progressive policy, while claiming it will fix the inequitable composition of Canada’s penal system.“The Bill C-5 legislation does not stop police from charging people with gun offences or prosecutors from pursuing convictions,” claimed the prime minister. “What it does do is make sure criminals face serious penalties, while addressing the overrepresentation of black Canadians and indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system.”The legislation, pushed forward by Trudeau on Monda,y will also limit magazines to a five-round capacity and even ban toys resembling guns. Additionally, Canada’s public safety minister also announced a mandatory buyback program for so-called assault weapons later this year.Despite years of more gun control, bans, buybacks, and nearly a billion dollars spent, gun violence continues to go up in Canada. Today Trudeau doubled down on his failed approach and again promised Canadians it will keep them safe. It won’t, just as it hasn’t for years. #cdnpoli— Raquel Dancho (@RaquelDancho) May 30, 2022Conservative MP, Raquel Dancho blasted the move on Twitter, while claiming Canada’s crime rate has been rising despite years of gun bans and buy-backs. However,  Trudeau has made it clear he won’t allow discussions on effectiveness slow down gun control agenda.“We cannot let the guns debate become so polarized that nothing gets done,” stated the prime minister. “We cannot let that happen in our country.”","Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces new gun control legislation in Ottawa, Ontario, on Monday, May 30, 2022.

Elise Stefanik (@RepStefanik) May 27, 2022As parents try and address the growing crisis, children with special needs or health issues who need certain formula to survive are more at risk. According to an exclusive report, 14-year-old Morgan Furhman has a rare genetic disorder and needs a specialized formula.“Because of her disorder, her life expectancy isn’t what a typical person would be,” explained the teen’s mother, Kathy Furhman. “If the formula, if that was the reason, I don’t think I could ever forgive myself.”As the shortage worsens, some parents are feeling responsible. While the US is working to get more baby formula back on shelves, some practitioners are blaming the shortage on a drop in breast feeding rates, which is a problem they said increased during the pandemic.The baby formula crisis started long before the Abbott recall.Our country is failing and the Biden admin’s government solutions are not solving the crisis.America is like a third world country now incapable of providing food for our babies. https://t.co/W8kuSlWmav— Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) May 25, 2022The longer the crisis persists, however, the more parents are searching for different alternatives to feed their children. Some have even tried making their own formula at home.“It doesn’t take much to make a baby become very sick,” warned Jessica Smith, Pediatrician at Mercy Clinic Pediatrics. “Can have seizures, not get the calories they need and end up in the hospital, so it is not safe to make your own formula at home. I would not even use your grandmother’s recipe.“Meanwhile, FDA Commissioner, Robert Califf believes the shortage may be over within a few months.","Only a few scoops are left in her next to last can, as Yury Navas, 29, of Laurel, Md., feeds her infant son, Jose Ismael Gálvez, 2 months, with the only formula he can take without digestive issues, Enfamil Infant, from her dwindling supply of formula at their apartment in Laurel, Md., Monday, May 23, 2022.
