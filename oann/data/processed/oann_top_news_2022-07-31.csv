2022-07-29,5:45 PM PT,"Flash flooding worsens across Ky., death toll rises","The Biden administration moved to ramp up federal aid to help with local recovery efforts in Kentucky after the president issued a Major Disaster Declaration in the state. Biden’s declaration Friday, covers all areas of the Bluegrass State recently stricken by severe storms, flooding, mudslides and landslides. The order comes as FEMA is assisting with efforts to find survivors and conducting federal recovery operations.“With more than 20 search and rescue teams on the ground,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated. “FEMA has deployed rescue personnel to assist with those efforts and they have dispatched an incident management assistant team.”Governor Andy Beshear called the situation quote “one of the worst, most devastating flooding events in Kentucky’s history” with more than a dozen deaths already reported. As damage assessments continue, Beshear said the death count is “going to get a lot higher.” He also sought to console those who have lost loved ones or cannot get in touch with them.“To all the families that know you’ve already sustained a loss. We’re going to grieve with you. We’re going to support you. We’re going to be here for you, not just today, but tomorrow and in the weeks and in the years to come,” voiced Beshear. “Everybody out there that is scared, that can’t get in touch with one of their relatives. Cell phones are down in so many of these regions. We tell you, I know how you feel. I couldn’t get in touch with members of my family after the tornadoes. So please continue to hope, continue to pray and we will try to connect as many people as possible.”Drone shots of the #Flooding in #Kentucky after it the water has receded several feet. #KyWx pic.twitter.com/UPgp6XRzx4— WxChasing- Brandon Clement (@bclemms) July 28, 2022At least 13 counties, so far, are listed for receiving the funds, but damage assessments are continuing. This means more could be added to the tally. At least 16 people have been killed as a result of the severe weather, a number the governor fears will double.The flooding that has hit Eastern Kentucky is absolutely devastating and there is even more rain expected.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:45 AM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022The House passed the $280 billion CHIPS Act. All but one Democrat and a cohort of Republicans pushed the legislation through in a 243-to-187 vote on Thursday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the spending package while claiming it would put taxpayer money towards union jobs and lowering costs.“Make it in America, as Mr. Hollier would say,” stated Pelosi. “Doing so is an economic imperative creating again nearly 100,000 good paying union jobs and lowering costs for American consumers, while producing a crucial component of nearly every major technology we enjoy.”The bill provides subsidies to domestic semiconductor manufacturing and invests billions in science and technology to help the US compete on the world stage. Fifty-two billion dollars is set aside specifically for microchip makers in the US to encourage them to build plants in America. However, the total cost of the bill is estimated to balloon up to $280 billion over the next five years.House Republican leadership attempted to rally against the bill, but to no avail. In the lead up to the vote, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) lambasted the bill as wasteful spending in a time of economic turbulence.McCarthy said the Senate passed a bill that took a small program and “turned it into a $280 billion blank check.” He added, it includes millions in mandatory spending on corporate welfare for whoever President Biden chooses.The stated objective of the bill is to jump start American semiconductor production to outpace China and ensure American technological independence should Taiwan fall to the People’s Republic. However, Rep. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) argued that pork is more prevalent in the bill than resource war logistics.“Chips are one of 10 sectors where China is seeking to break American dominance,” he noted. “This bill does not address our issues with China and it certainly does not address issues, the other nine issues.”The legislation moved through the Senate Wednesday and is now headed to President Biden’s desk.","FILE – The inside of a computer is seen on Feb 23, 2019, in Jersey City, N.J.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is defending his “about-face” on the Inflation Reduction Act, Republicans are criticizing the bill. On Thursday, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said it’s absurd to raise taxes on “job creators” during a recession.The GOP lawmaker explained the 15 percent minimum tax on corporations changes the way they can expense and deduct, which will only increase inflation. Cramer added, the bill neglects the country’s real economic problems to address hypothetical ones.“There’s like, what is it, 50 or 60 billion dollars for a green bank?” he asked. “Five billion dollars for urban trees? I mean, give me a break. We’ve got real serious problems in this country and they want to give money away for tree planting for crying out loud.”I have tried to work across party lines when it makes sense, but this Democratic power grab through reconciliation will make every economic problem in America worse. Terrible deal.— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 28, 2022Also on Thursday, Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) specifically asked the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate the impact of the Democrat’s spending package, which he calls an updated version of Build Back Better.","FILE – Sen Kevin Cramer, R-ND, speaks during a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee oversight hearing, May 20, 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington.

On Thursday, prosecutors said the girl confirmed 27-year-old Gerson Fuentes attacked her and DNA testing proved he impregnated her.The Guatemalan National faces two counts of raping a child under 13-years-old. Franklin County Judge Julie Lynch said Fuentes is a “substantial flight risk” after detectives confirmed there was no documentation that he was in the US legally.The girl became pregnant after the second rape but was unable to get an abortion in Ohio because state law prohibits the procedure after six weeks, with no exception for rape. The girl realized she was pregnant after six weeks and three days. The young girl turned 10 before having to travel to Indiana for an abortion and Judge Lynch highlighted the trauma she endured.At today's Gerson Fuentes bond hearing, the judge suggests that the out-of-state abortion becoming ""a national hot point"" to the extent of President Biden referring to the rape case was part of the ""mental and emotional trauma"" the 10-year-old Ohio child endured. pic.twitter.com/aTQ3YtnIa3— Mia Cathell (@MiaCathell) July 28, 2022“To allow him to return to that home, the traumatic and psychological impact would be undeserving to an alleged victim,” Lynch said.BREAKING: Judge rules 27-year-old illegal alien Gerson Fuentes, accused of repeatedly raping and impregnating the 10-year-old Ohio girl, will be held WITHOUT BOND pic.twitter.com/GEpcmo1fQc— Mia Cathell (@MiaCathell) July 28, 2022President Biden mentioned the story while signing an executive order about abortion rights, noting that the girl got the abortion on June 30, six days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Conservatives, including Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost suggested that he made it up. They changed their tune after Fuentes was arrested and charged with two counts of raping a child under age 13.“Having to drive to another state, have this whole entire incident in this child’s life become a national hot point to the point where the president of the United States is referring to this case,” the judge voiced. “The court finds that that trauma is enough to never have that child be around the alleged defendant.”27-year-old illegal alien Gerson Fuentes was indicted Thursday by the Franklin County grand jury on two counts of first-degree felony rape for the impregnation of the 10-year-old Ohio girl.Video from Friday's preliminary hearing: pic.twitter.com/XScAXnziXJ— Mia Cathell (@MiaCathell) July 22, 2022He has pleaded not guilty and faces life in prison without parole if convicted.","Gerson Fuentes, right, the man accused of raping a 10-year-old girl who then traveled to Indiana to have an abortion, enters Franklin County common pleas court for his bond hearing in Columbus, Ohio, Thursday, July 28, 2022.

Federal lawmakers unveiled a statue honoring Earhart in the Capitol building. In a ceremony held on Wednesday, senators from both sides of the aisle delivered heartfelt remarks about her legacy of being the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean in 1932 before tragically disappearing during a flight over the Pacific in 1937. Among those attending the ceremony was Kansas Senator Roger Marshall (R) who expressed enthusiasm that the statue has been added to the Capitol’s statuary hall.“It was great to share this moment, the unveiling of Amelia’s statue with the people who had been working for two decades on this,” said Marshall. “I got to spend several days there with this community and they’re just so proud.

What new balance will come out of the world. from a little corner in a capital of her dreams, still living in boundaries unfold of what could be broken.”The ceremony was held on the 90th anniversary of her historic flight across the Atlantic and what would have been her 125th birthday.","Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, center, is joined by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., center left, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., far left, former Kansas Sen.

Steve Scalise, R.La., speaks during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, July 19, 2022. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:33 PM PT – Thursday, July 28, 2022Americans are facing pain at the pump, rising consumer prices, increased crime rates and an open border. These are all issues covered by House Republicans at a recent press conference while presenting their plan moving into the coming summer recess.Committee Vice Chair Mike Johnson (R-La.) highlighted the mistakes made by the Biden administration while illustrating that they are focused on the wrong things.“Well they are taking guns from law-abiding citizens, they are dishing out corporate welfare and yet another tax and spend reconciliation bill,” he listed. “The Democrat agenda alternates between attempts to distract the American people at best and outright misguided policy at worst.”Johnson continued by stating what the Republicans believe are the three I’s of the coming election: inflation, immigration and incompetence.“Of course, many expect that the update tomorrow will confirm what we seem to feel and know intuitively — that we’ve officially entered a recession,” said the GOP lawmaker. “And instead of working to keep our economy out of recession, the White House is busy in itself trying to redefine what that term means.”Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) continued by reaffirming the dangers of the Democrats’ Build Back Better bill, asserting it will only reduce costs of drugs by limiting production which will ultimately slow research and development of cures and treatments for disease. He affirmed the solution to this is the bipartisan House Resolution 19, which will lower costs and increase transparency.“And one of the worst parts about this bill, if you’re someone like most Americans that pays into Medicare your whole life, this bill is robbing Medicare to get go ahead and pay for insurance premiums,” explained the Ohio lawmaker. “The money that is saved is going to insurance companies, not even targeted for care.”Closing out the conference, Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) doubled down that we have already reached a recession and that the Biden administration is merely in denial.“We’re seeing denial and what you’ve seen in the last week is President Biden spending more time trying to redefine what inflation and a recession rather than working to lay out a plan to stop us from going into a recession,” he stated.Scalise said the only way to escape the current recession is to reverse the failed policies that led to it, but the first step to ending any crisis is to admit that there is one.","House Minority Whip Rep.

According to the New York Times report Monday, cartels are earning an estimated $13 billion annually from the illicit practice. Revenue soared from an estimated $500 million back in 2018 as cartels have ramped up their involvement in human smuggling operations over the past few years.The billions in earnings from those activities exclude revenue from drug smuggling. According to congressional testimony from the Acting Director of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last year, cartels are becoming more profitable as they have teams have teams specializing in logistics, transportation, surveillance, stash houses and accounting.During the America First Agenda Summit Tuesday, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) noted the estimates cartels are making on a regional level. He said in South Texas cartels are making $150 million a week by trafficking people, also adding the current administration is turning their head on the issues.The Biden Admin is allowing a flood of drugs to come over our borders—just this year in the Rio Grande Valley, 144lbs of fentanyl & 27,550lbs of meth have been interdicted.These drugs are overwhelming & killing people in my state.Biden has got to do his job & enforce the law. pic.twitter.com/XOCXXbWOAj— Sen.

Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / APOAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:20 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022Senate Republicans discussed the rise in crime that’s affecting communities across the nation amid soft-on-crime Democrat policies. On Capitol Hill Thursday, Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) were among those who spoke on the policies. Senator Cornyn highlighted the amount of drugs coming across the border due to the open border policies. He noted that 108,000 Americans died of overdoses last year marking an all-time high.“Almost all of those drugs come across the south western border and the human smugglers and the drug cartel’s understand that if they overwhelm the capacity of the border patrol to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming across, that they can divert the attention of the border patrol and open up a 4-lane highway for the exportation of illegal drugs into the United States,” said Cornyn.He pointed out that the Biden administration failure to recognize the rise in gun violence, drug smuggling and criminal street gangs are all connected to the open border policy. Senator Cotton stressed that the man who is accused of attempting to stab GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) was immediately released under New York’s lax bail laws.“The reasons for this crime wave is simple,” voiced Cotton. “The Democrat party cares more about criminals than it does about victims. Today’s Democrats want to defund, disarm and demonize our police. They elect extreme Soros prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law as it is written and they’ve abolished bail in some places, including New York.”NOW: Senate Republicans discuss the rising crime affecting communities across the country, thanks to soft-on-crime democrat policies.  https://t.co/oxjH4uGQ8Q— Senate Republicans (@SenateGOP) July 27, 2022Cotton said liberals are refusing to allow police to enforce the law and imprison those who violate the law. He added, Democrat voters in San Francisco voted to remove District Attorney Chesa Boudin from office claiming his progressive agenda was leading to high levels of crime on the streets.Additionally, residents in Los Angeles are ousting L.A. County District Attorney George Gascon after prosecutors have argued “criminals feel emboldened, residents unsafe and victims abandoned as he fails to prosecute a slew of crimes.”GOP senators went on to suggest disorder and chaos will only continue throughout the US as long as Democrats push their soft-on-crime policies.",Cornyn.

Democrats have no plan to help Americans, but their policies only make it worse.”McCarthy continued to address recent conflicts in the House after being asked his reaction to the mayor of D.C. requesting for the National Guard to help patrol for illegal immigrants in the city and how the Republicans are being accused of using migrants as a political pawn.“Because what has happened because of their actions, every single community in America is now a border city,” he continued. “This is a national crisis. Fentanyl is now the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. This is their policies, which they created. They created a national security issue throughout the entire country.”McCarthy was also asked about his potential to become Speaker of the House after midterms. As the minority leader, he is a likely choice to become Speaker if Republicans win a majority. He has not agreed with the way Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has handled the position, especially after issues with her husband’s apparent stock purchases.“I think its ironic that the Speaker of the House now talks about bringing up a bill at the very end of a term of Congress,” he noted. “So her husband could trade all the way through, but now it becomes a crisis?The California Republican continued to challenge Democrat policies, illustrating the issues many people have with the apparent effects they have on inflation. From rising gas prices to salary losses and increasing crime, McCarthy believes more needs to be done to fix Democrat failures. The House begins recess in August and representatives will return in September.﻿","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calif. speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, July 29, 2022.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 4:00 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin (D) responded to the backlash he’s received for striking a deal on a reconciliation package.“I’ve never reversed,” Manchin said. “I’ve never been in reverse in my lifetime and I never walked away.”Senator Manchin defended his controversial decision to strike a deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a sweeping reconciliation package called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which they said will lower the deficit by over $300 billion over a period of 10 years.In a video released on Thursday, Manchin described the new legislation as a quote win-win for the US. The bill will invest over $369 billion into fighting so-called climate change and extend Obamacare subsidies over the next three years.“So, I think it’s a win-win here, but people are all getting hyped up,” he voiced. “It might help the Democrats and I’m a Republican so I’ve got to be against it. Come on, guys. We’re Americans. Look at the bill, it’s a good bill. It’s a Democrat and Republican bill.”Additionally, he claimed the bill would not raise taxes on anybody though it would impose a 15 percent minimum corporate tax and close so-called tax loop holes for big corporations. The legislation is also estimated to raise another $124 billion by bolstering the IRS to go after tax cheats.“We don’t raise taxes on anybody and anybody that says we’re raising taxes by putting a minimum of 15 percent corporate tax on corporations, the largest corporations have $1 million of book value or greater that that’s going to be inflammatory,” the West Virginia senator stated. “I don’t think many of us can figure out why. When we reduced it from 35 to 21 in 2017, that tax cut was cut by 14 percent so that people weren’t paying at least 15 percent or supposedly paying 21. If someone’s upset they weren’t paying anything please come forward and tell us why you were able to have this great country protect you and give you these opportunities. You didn’t have to pay anything into it.”BIDEN on the Schumer-Manchin reconciliation deal""I want to thank Senator Schumer and Senator Manchin…If enacted, this legislation will be historic, and I urge the Senate to move on this bill as soon as possible, and for the House to follow as well."" pic.twitter.com/L6ii8HFvRK— Alayna Treene (@alaynatreene) July 27, 2022He then went on to claim the legislation will keep the fossil fuel industry strong despite measures to make large investments into so-called climate change programs.“This is a bill that keeps the fossil industry and keeps the country in a very strong position until those new technologies kick in, whenever that may be,” he expressed. “That transition will happen when whatever you have that you’re using, you’ve got something better to replace it with and can do just as well. If not better, cheaper prices. The market takes over.”The package will be put to a vote on the senate floor next week.","Sen.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested the FBI exaggerated domestic terrorism statistics to hit performance metrics manufactured by the bureau itself.On Wednesday, Jordan wrote a letter to the agency’s director sharing alleged whistleblower accounts. He said through these accounts he found that FBI officials are “pressuring agents to reclassify cases as domestic violent extremism” even if the cases do not meet the criteria. Jordan went on to say one whistleblower has called it an environment of “pressure” as superiors use these metrics to give awards and promotions.They contend the manipulation is done to satisfy the Biden administration’s narrative that domestic violent extremism is America’s “greatest threat.” One of the implicated operatives is Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault who was also among those previously accused of covering up Hunter Biden’s money trail.🚨 #BREAKING 🚨Whistleblowers: FBI Leadership Pressuring Agents to Artificially Pad Domestic Terrorism Data pic.twitter.com/fGuQbUbjX3— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) July 27, 2022On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) accused the FBI of a widespread effort to discredit any unfavorable but legitimate information about the President’s son leading up to the 2020 presidential election.“This guy by the name of Thibault,” Grassley said. “All you got to do is go back to a lot of his social media stuff and then very partisan comments. He was the one making these decisions to shut down or open an investigation. I brought that information to Director Wray, or let’s put it this way, I put out a press release and that guy was moved out of that decision making process.”.⁦@ChuckGrassley⁩ office has been in contact with credible whistleblowers who acknowledged that FBI officials were asked to downplay Evidence of Hunter Biden’s activity/ his laptop and push the claim that these truths were disinformation 👇👇 pic.twitter.com/ACqV21C3x3— Sara A. Carter (@SaraCarterDC) July 26, 2022In October 2020, just one month before the election, Thibault allegedly ordered to shut down an avenue of derogatory Hunter Biden reporting. This allegation came when a whistleblower told Grassley there has been a pattern of active partisanship at the bureau on matters about investigations of the Trump campaign and Hunter’s suspicious financial deals.To seemingly counter GOP’s investigative efforts, Grassley said that in August 2020 that he and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) were subjected to a “unnecessary” briefing from the FBI, which they said had been “weaponized” against sitting members of the Senate.“I want to know what concrete steps Wray’s is going to take to shut down this partisan approach,” Grassley shared.  “This is hurting the credibility of the FBI.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:20 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022The White House attacked Texas and Arizona amid D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for National Guard Troops to deal with the bus loads of migrants coming from both states. During a press briefing Thursday, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre accused both GOP led states of using migrants as a “political ploy.”“That is shameful and that is just wrong,” voiced Pierre. “What Republicans are doing, the way that they’re meddling in the process and using migrants as a political pawn is just wrong.”Both states have sent thousands of migrants to the nation’s Capital since April as part of an effort to deal with the influx of migrant crossings at the southern border. Jean Pierre said the Biden administration is in touch with Bowser and claimed Texas and Arizona are not following proper protocols.Still, reporters pressed Jean-Pierre on whether the White House “preference” would be for migrants to stay in small towns in Texas and Arizona rather than coming to big cities. She said migrants should be expelled under Title 42, transferred into custody or placed in the care of local organizations for proper processing.“That is not what I said. They said that they’re sending migrants to big cities on purpose using them as a political point,” she responded. “I’m saying is what Republicans are doing is wrong and there is a process in place. We should follow the process. There’s a legal process in place and they should follow it.”""So the White House's preference would be for small towns in Texas and Arizona to have to take care of these migrants instead of a large metropolitan city like Washington, D.C.?""KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: ""There's a process.""🤔 pic.twitter.com/GEXMp1dnH5— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 28, 2022In response to Bowser’s request, Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas) pointed out that D.C. finally understands what Texas is dealing with. He said thousands of migrants have overwhelmed and overrun Lone Star State communities.“Washington D.C. finally understands what Texans have been dealing with every single day as our communities are overrun and overwhelmed by thousands of illegal immigrants thanks to President Biden’s open border policies,” Abbott’s office said in a statement. “If the mayor wants a solution to this crisis she should call on President Biden to take immediate action to secure the border, something he has failed to do.

According to NBC News on Thursday, cited Congressman Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) claimed that Chinese diplomats are trying to pressure lawmakers into preventing Pelosi from going to Taiwan.In addition, the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is reportedly contacting US lawmakers with a similar demand. This after China threatened Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan posed a risk of military conflict in the far east. Meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Biden earlier on Thursday that the US is “playing with fire” over Taiwan.“I think should Speaker Pelosi proceed with the trip, it would coincide with the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army in China,” said Mark Cozad, acting associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corp. “We’re likely, I think, to see an increase and a noticeable increase in Chinese airspace incursions in and around Taiwan in the event that she proceeds with her trip. We may even see something called a median line incursion and that’s a breach of the maritime border that exists in the center of the Taiwan Strait.”They also said that a stepped up US military presence to safeguard Pelosi risked raising tensions. US lawmakers said it is a “miscalculation” on China’s part to try and pressure them.The #Chinese side has repeatedly made clear to the #US side our serious concern over Speaker Pelosi’s planed visit to #Taiwan and our firm opposition.

(AP Photo/Christian Chavez)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:40 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022Authorities discovered nearly 100 migrants bound for the US hidden inside an abandoned trailer in Southern Mexico. Ninety-eight migrants, including several children, from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were found on the side of the highway in Veracruz on Wednesday.Paramedics estimated around 400 people could have been in the trailer at one time, but frantically tried to escape once they started running out of air. Many of the migrants were injured while attempting to get out.“We were told there were close to 400 immigrants travelling in the trailer,” said Cristobal Cisneros Valencia, Civil Protection Paramedic. “When they started to feel suffocated, they hit the roof of the trailer and most of them jumped out. That is why most of the injuries we treated were ankle and knee fractures with damaged sense of balance. We had to move one person (to a hospital for treatment) because he was unconscious.” According to border officials, transporting migrants in truck-trailers is one of the most dangerous methods smugglers use. A recent New York Times report noted cartels are earning an estimated $13 billion annually from the illicit practice. Revenue soared from an estimated $500 million back in 2018 as cartels have ramped up their involvement in human smuggling operations over the past few years.The billions in earnings from those activities exclude revenue from drug smuggling. According to congressional testimony from the Acting Director of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last year, cartels are becoming more profitable as they have teams have teams specializing in logistics, transportation, surveillance, stash houses and accounting.This comes as the Biden administration’s lax border policies encourage migrants to make the journey. Around 1.7 million migrants and unaccompanied child have crossed the border since President Joe Biden took office.","People cross the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico into El Paso, Texas, Tuesday, March 23, 2021.
