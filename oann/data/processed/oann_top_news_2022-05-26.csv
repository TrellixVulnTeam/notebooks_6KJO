The governor toured Texas National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety border security assets in Eagle Pass, Texas.During a press conference, Abbott provided an update on his state’s border security strategies along the Rio Grande. He said the Lone Star State will use resources to build a stronger, more efficient barrier to deter illegal crossings including razor wire.“One of those strategies is increasing the quantity and quality in the types of barriers that we’re putting up,” said Abbott. “A tool that people agree is an effective tool is the concertina wire, which is the razor wire barrier that makes it far more difficult for people to cross the border.”Abbott also discussed the state’s continued efforts to work alongside law enforcement partners in Mexico and the several Mexican states including Chihuaha, which he signed historic border security agreements with last month. The Republican governor also detailed the state’s ongoing support for local border communities, including Eagle Pass, as they grapple with the mass influx of illegal immigrants. If all else fails, sending more buses of illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C. could be in the cards.“We are also making available to Eagle Pass and Maverick County the ability to be bussed to Washington, D.C. if a large number of people are milling around,” the governor voiced. “As of today we have sent 45 buses to Washington, D.C. and a whole lot more where that’s coming from.” Toured border security assets along the Texas-Mexico border & provided an update on our strategies to secure the border in Eagle Pass yesterday. Texas will not allow the federal government’s inaction to impede the safety & security Texans deserve. https://t.co/KLOSpDsLs6— Gov.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:55 AM PT – Tuesday, May 24, 2022The man accused of attacking Dave Chapelle admits he was triggered by the comedian’s jokes. In an exclusive jailhouse interview with the New York Post, 23-year-old Isaiah Lee confirmed the reason he rushed on stage during a show at the Hollywood Bowl.Lee said he identifies as bi-sexual and felt Chapelle’s jokes about the LGBTQ community were too insensitive. He claimed he intended to enjoy the show but instead grew increasingly angry.“I identify as bisexual,” said Isaiah Lee. “I wanted him to know what he said was triggering.”The rapper who once wrote a song about Chapelle said he brought a replica handgun with a retractable knife that night because he is a “minor celebrity” and needed the protection. Lee has remained behind bars since his May 3 arrest in connection with the alleged attack on the comedian with a judge refusing to lower his bail.“I wanted him to know that next time he should consider first running his material by people it could effect,” Lee voiced. “I’m also a single dad and my son is five. It’s a struggle and I wanted Dave Chappelle to know it’s not a joke.”Prosecutors decided that the Bowl incident did not rise to the level of a felony, noting that Chappelle was not injured in the attack and Lee did not have the weapon in his hand at the time.Update: Soros-supported Los Angeles district attorney @GeorgeGascon has declined to pursue the case against Isaiah Lee, the man who was arrested over tackling Dave Chapelle on stage at the Hollywood Bowl.

(AP Photo/Joe Maiorana, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:47 AM PT – Monday, May 23, 2022Former President Donald Trump still holds an immense sway over who will lead the Republican Party in several down ballot races. According to numbers crunched by Breitbart News Sunday, Trump is 81-and-three in picking the winner of GOP primaries heading into Tuesday’s batch of elections.This includes 23 wins and two losses garnered in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Kentucky and Idaho last week. Georgia lawyer and candidate for the states sixth congressional district Jake Evans (R-Ga.) touted how the so-called “trump bump” influenced his candidacy.“We are surging and have continued to be surging really for the past month,” said Evans. “Trumps endorsement catapulted us forward and he has really pushed us on a strong trajectory, we feel great about it. The reality is voters want to get back to the America first agenda. They wanna get back to the agenda that delivered four of the best years we’ve had in a very long time.”Trump has orchestrated key wins in battleground elections including in Ohio’s senate race to replace outgoing Republican Senator Rob Portman. Trump-endorsed JD Vance (R-Ohio) won the GOP primary against Josh Mandel (R-Ohio) who was backed by other establishment Republicans.Additionally, the former president oversaw a huge victory for the America First movement in Pennsylvania when Doug Mastriano (R-Pa.) won the states GOP gubernatorial primary. Other major victories for him include  Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Bo Hines (R-N.C.) and Andy Barr (R-Ky.).“We’ve got to get back to putting American’s first,” declared Evans. “The liberals seem to be more focused on Ukraine over in Europe than they are actually here at home domestically making sure that we can actually feed our babies. We need to make sure American manufacturing returns back to America.”In the meantime, their are several key primaries that could set the course of the general election coming up. the jury’s still out over who won the GOP senate primary in Pennsylvania. The election results were too close to call.","FILE – Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at the Delaware County Fairgrounds, April 23, 2022, in Delaware, Ohio.

According to officials, the patient is being quarantined as their investigation continues. This marks the second confirmed case in the US after another man was found in Boston earlier in the week.Monkeypox causes flu-like symptoms before the characteristic rash develops. The virus is spread through close contact with people, animals or material infected with the virus. It enters the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, the eyes, nose and mouth“We’ve seen a few cases in Europe over the last five years, just in travelers,” said Dr. Rosamund Lewis, who runs the WHO’s smallpox research. “This is the first time we’re seeing cases across many countries at the same time in people who have not traveled to the endemic regions in Africa.” #Monkeypox has so far been reported from 11 countries that normally don't have the disease. WHO is working with these countries & others to expand surveillance, and provide guidance.There are about 80 confirmed cases, and 50 pending investigations. More likely to be reported. pic.twitter.com/YQ3pVJVNVQ— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) May 20, 2022The outbreak has quickly advanced across Europe and North America over the last week and is expected to be far more widespread as more doctors look for the signs and symptoms. The CDC has put medical professionals on alert and is warning those with higher risk factors, particularly men who have sex with other men, to be vigilant.“Many diseases can be spread through sexual contact. You could get a cough or a cold through sexual contact,” said WHO advisor Andy Seale. “It doesn’t mean that it’s a sexually transmitted disease.” Seale’s agreed many of the people infected in the current outbreak identify as gay or bisexual, but “this is a virus that could affect anyone.” Monkeypox is taking over the global conversation and has left many questioning the validity of the virus’s actual threat.PCR tests are used to identify the infection.TOPICS:AfricadiseaseEuropeINVESTIGATIONmonkeypoxNew York CitynewsOANOANNPCRrosamund lewissicknesssmallpoxWHO SHARETWEETPINSHARE","This 1997 image provided by the CDC during an investigation into an outbreak of monkeypox, which took place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formerly Zaire, and depicts the dorsal surfaces of the hands of a monkeypox case patient, who was displaying the appearance of the characteristic rash during its recuperative stage.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:37 AM PT – Wednesday, May 25, 2022More FBI agents took the stand at the Sussmann trial and confirmed they were led astray from the very start of their investigation into claims of Russia collusion with former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.The link between the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Russia collusion narrative got clearer in day seven of the trial. Taking the limelight in the courtroom was a file titled ‘Crimson Rhino.’ This file was reportedly basis for the investigation into the 2016 campaign and was provided to former top FBI lawyer James Baker from Sussmann.It’s origins come from tech executive Rodney Joffe who was tied to the Hillary Clinton campaign and was a confidential human source for the FBI. He ordered client Jared Novick who ran a data analysis firm to do research on several people tied to then candidate Trump. He also said he felt uncomfortable doing the work because he knew it was opposition research for a political campaign.Meanwhile, a mid-level FBI agent from the Chicago field office Kurt Hydie took the stand. Hydie reportedly wrote a memo that formally kicked off his office’s investigation. He admitted to writing a typographical error when he said the information came from the Department of Justice and not Sussmann. That caused confusion within the FBI where officers thought they were doing research for the federal government not a political actor.“That created a lot of confusion,” Hydie said. “May not have had otherwise.”Berkowitz is talking about this Grasso email showing Joffe called him and provided some info about the Alfa Bank matter.

They could wrap their case as soon as Friday and leave it up to the jurors to decide Sussmann’s fate.","Michael Sussmann, a cybersecurity lawyer who represented the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign in 2016, leaves federal courthouse in Washington, Monday, May 16, 2022.

He commented about how had previously spoken following the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting while noting there have been over 900 reported incidents of gunfire on school grounds since that incident.“Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen?” Biden asked. “Where in God’s name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with it? It’s time to turn this pain into action.”Meanwhile, the shooting remains under investigation as police try to determine the motive behind the massacre. On Wednesday, police revealed all 21 victims, 19 students and two teachers, were in the same fourth grade classroom when the gunman entered and opened fire. The bodies of all victims have since been removed from campus, while DNA matches are still being conducted to confirm parents relations to the students.","Law enforcement personnel stand outside Robb Elementary School following a shooting, Tuesday, May 24, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas.

That’s why the School Safety Act is so important. It creates what is a clearinghouse that provides best practices and allows people to understand what are the pathologies, what are the things that you look for before before this happens?”The School Safety Act would include threat prevention, preparedness, protection, incident response and recovery. So far, the measure has only passed the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.","Sen.

She held a press conference at the Children’s National Hospital on Tuesday.During her speech, Harris acknowledged the pandemic-related lockdown has led to stress, burnout and mental health problems. She noted this particularly true among health care workers. Harris also acknowledged poor mental health among children.The CDC recently found over a third of high school students reported they have experienced poor mental health amid the lockdown, while nearly half said they felt sad or hopeless over the last year. Harris then attempted to show her commitment to America’s youth.“You know when we talk about our children, and I know for this group, we all believe that when we talk about the children of the community, they are a children of the community,” stated the Vice President. “And in that way, we should all feel a direct sense of responsibility for their well being.”﻿Harris also acknowledged the baby formula crisis and said one of her and President Joe Biden’s highest priorities is to make sure there is enough supply.We're working to ensure that there is enough safe baby formula available for all those who need it.

9:57 AM PT",Suspect in NYC subway shooting apprehended,"Suspect in NYC subway shooting apprehendedAndrew Abdullah is escorted into the Fifth precinct, Tuesday, May 24, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:57 AM PT – Wednesday, May 25, 2022The primary suspect in a deadly subway shooting in New York City surrendered after a lengthy manhunt. In a Tuesday press conference, the NYPD Commissioner announced the arrest of 25-year-old Andrew Abdullah.“Today the manhunt for Andrew Abdullah is over,” said NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell. “Less than three hours after the NYPD released his photograph to the public, Mr. Abdullah knew he had nowhere left to run.”Abdullah stands accused of fatally shooting 48-year-old Daniel Enriquez in New York’s Q Line subway train over the weekend. Police were able to identify the suspect through canvassing by transit officers, community engagement and social media outreach. The arrest came after a local bishop went to negotiate the suspects surrender with the police.“He was arrested in his lawyer’s office this afternoon and is now being prepared for arraignment,” stated Sewell. “The murder of Daniel Enriquez was every New Yorker’s worst nightmare. Tragically, it’s a scenario that we’ve seen play out far too many times before. Andrew Abdullah was well known to the criminal justice system, but again and again his repeat offenses were not enough to keep him off our streets.”Andrew Abdullah is now in custody. We’re grateful to New Yorkers who shared information — and to the @NYPDDetectives for their hard work investigating this senseless homicide. https://t.co/v05nARQ0oP— Commissioner Sewell (@NYPDPC) May 24, 2022Commissioner Sewell revealed Abdullah’s lengthy criminal history, which stretched back to 2016. That history includes felony assault, attempted murder, grand larceny and an ongoing gun charge. New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) blamed the shooting on what he called a “revolving door” criminal justice system.“We got him and we got him in a way that he did not cause more injuries to New Yorker’s,” voiced Adams. “I think the commissioner stated something that’s important, we got a killer off our streets. Far too many killers are back on our streets through a revolving door criminal justice system that appears to pit the NYPD and good New Yorker’s against the bad guys.”In the meantime, he’s being charged with second degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree while investigators review the evidence against him.","Andrew Abdullah is escorted into the Fifth precinct, Tuesday, May 24, 2022, in New York.
