Abrams spoke at a University on Wednesday. There, she stated that if immigrants have finished high school, then they should be able to attend college. She added the difference between American citizens and immigrants is “artificial obstruction.”“Right now, you don’t have the choice because in Georgia if you are undocumented, you are denied full access. That does not make sense. We are growing the next generation of leaders and I believe we should be investing,” Abrams said. “It doesn’t take away from anyone for immigrant students to be able to attend our schools.”Meanwhile, even Democrats are worried about Abrams’s current standing in Georgia’s gubernatorial race.

During a press conference on Wednesday, DeSantis refuted the Democrat’s recent criticisms of Florida by saying that California “can not even keep the power on.”This comes amid an energy crisis in the Golden State. The State is at risk of blackouts which Newsom blames on the summer heat wave. Earlier in the week, Newsom warned about the threat to California’s power grid. He urged residents to reduce their use of electricity.“Californians, you’ve stepped up to help in a big way to keep the lights on so far,” Newsom said. “But we’re heading into the worst part of this heat wave. And the risk for outages is real and it’s immediate. These triple- digit temperatures throughout much of the are State are leading, not surprisingly, to record demand on the energy grid.”DeSantis stressed that it was ridiculous that Newsom criticized Florida. The Republican added that the Sunshine State has always stood for freedom, especially during the COVID-19 crisis.","Florida Gov.

1:50 PM PT","Legal Nonprofit: Michigan Unwilling to Purge ‘25,000’ Dead People on Voter Rolls","Legal Nonprofit: Michigan Unwilling to Purge ‘25,000’ Dead People on Voter RollsDaniel Baldwin, OAN White House CorrespondentUPDATED 1:50 PM PT – Thursday, September 8, 2022The Public Interest Legal Foundation scored a victory in court over Democrat Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. A U.S. District Court Judge rejected Benson’s request to dismiss the lawsuit regarding Michigan’s voter rolls.“The goal is to get dead registrants off the voter rolls in an important state like Michigan,” said J. Christian Adams, president of PILF. “The National Voter Registration Act requires states to do reasonable list maintenance, to remove deceased registrants and voters. Unfortunately in Michigan, some of these people have been dead for over 20 years, and they’re still on the voter rolls. We just want the law to be enforced.”PILF is a legal nonprofit group suing Benson regarding an alleged violation of the National Voter Registration Act. Benson is a facing count of failure to conduct list maintenance.“We found 25,000 people were dead and still on the voter rolls in Michigan,” Adams revealed. “The fact that there’s dead registrants on the rolls is not a Michigan problem,” Adams continued. “What’s a Michigan problem is the seeming unwillingness to do anything about it.”Adams claims PILF gave the names of these allegedly dead registrants before the 2020 election.“As far as we can tell, years have gone by, after we gave the names to Michigan, and nothing has happened in large part,” Adams said. “And they’ve just demanded to know more about us than the actual investigation they ought to be doing of the names.”Adams says PILF has a rigorous process as to how it collects and cross references data.“We do this all over the country,” Adams explained. “We collect the voter rolls, and then we bounce them against a whole bunch of indicators as to whether or not somebody’s dead. We try to get it right by using the social security death index, social security matches. We use obituaries and gravestones. We also use credit reporting services, people who are in the business of knowing whether or not you’re alive. We use all of this information. That’s out there to derive our list.”Adams says PILF has a history of success in lawsuits, citing a settlement against the State Department of Pennsylvania to remove deceased voters from the voter rolls in April 2021. “There aren’t false positives in the data,” said Adams. “If anything we were conservative. We found other people who’ve been dead that weren’t even on the list because there could be a name match issue.”“These registrants are dead,” Adams continued. “Period. And so we will be successful one way or another, because the dead registrants eventually one way or another are going to be removed. It’s a question of how much kicking and screaming goes on before that day comesOne America News reached out to Benson for comment, but has yet to hear back as of publishing this article.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png," Biden Admin.

Korean nuclear programsSecretary of State Antony Blinken listens as President Joe Biden speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:45 PM PT – Thursday, September 8, 2022America’s adversaries seem to be gaining ground on their problematic ambitions which may challenge US National Security. On Wednesday, the US State Department lamented Joe Biden’s main foreign policy goal. His goal revived the failed Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran. It has yet to hit yet another setback in talks with the Rouge State.Last month, Iran gave a proposal to the EU diplomats who are negotiating on behalf of America. Officials hoped it would lead to a final deal. However, last week after US officials responded by saying that some of the demands were unreasonable, Iran sent another proposal which the State Department deemed not constructive.These developments are not going to deter Biden diplomats from trying to pursue the deal despite Israeli news outlets claiming Biden told their Prime Minister that a deal with Iran was off the table for now. Verdant Patel, the Principal Deputy Spokesperson of the State Department spoke on the issue.“It is an extraordinarily complex set of issues,” explained Patel. “It is unfortunate that Iran’s response to us took us backwards, and we, of course, are not going to conclude a deal that is not in the US national security interest. But this is something that we’re continuing to pursue. We are studying Iran’s response, we are coordinating with our E3 allies and we’re continuing to go through this process.”Additionally, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed the potential death of the deal with its latest assessment of Iran’s nuclear program. Earlier this year, the IAEA warned that Iran was just months away from enriching enough uranium to make a nuclear weapon. Now, it’s believed that Iran has reached that point. They stressed it cannot say whether Iran’s nuclear program is entirely peaceful.Additionally, Iran has resisted requests from the IAEA to open up its nuclear facilities to an international inspection. In the meantime, the Biden State Department still believes it can seal a deal with the Ayatollah and get Iran to simmer its ambitions.“There is really only one ultimate end goal of this deal Sayid, and that is to ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And that continues to be our vision forward and be the reason why we continue to pursue this, because we believe that a mutual return to compliance will help us get there. It will put restraints on Iran’s nuclear program,” Patel said. “It’s an important step for regional stability and in the national security interest of the United States.”Meanwhile in East Asia, Biden’s special Envoy for North Korea, Sung Kim, is trying to rally regional partners in order to establish defense measures in case the Kim Jong-un government sparks a conflict. Ambassador Kim and his counterparts from Japan and South Korea held a conference in Tokyo where they all vowed to respond swiftly to any provocation from Pyongyang.They warned that North Korea is gearing up to conduct its first nuclear test since 2017. The newest test will add to its increasing tests of military equipment as its military has launched more than 30-missiles this year.“We are preparing for all contingencies in close coordination with our Japan and South Korea allies and we are prepared to make short and long-term adjustments to our military posture in responding to the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) provocation,” Kim remarked. “We are committed to both defense and deterrence to protect our allies in the region.”Despite the worrisome activities by Iran and North Korea, it seems that the Biden administration is willing to listen to its allies in Israel and East Asia. The Counties are calling for action against Countries that may threaten regional stability with aspirations to develop a nuclear weapon.","Secretary of State Antony Blinken listens as President Joe Biden speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2022, in Washington.

Additionally, they reported that over 460,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered despite admitting the at-risk population currently sits at 1.6 million people.“We only have data from 35 jurisdictions,” Dr. Daskalakis said. “That’s just over half of all jurisdictions that are directly receiving vaccine. But over 460,000 doses have been administered. Keep in mind, the population at highest risk is approximately 1.6 million people right now. So even with this partial view we have now from the reporting jurisdictions, we’re seeing strong progress, really getting shots into arms.”Fenton also announced they were launching a program to address a racial disparity in vaccine distribution and will begin providing vaccines to the LGBTQ community in preparation for upcoming Pride events.“Our focus now is to reach the remainder of the eligible population where they are – at trusted locations and events across the Country. And equity has to be a key point and priority embedded in throughout our response,” Fenton said. “We are launching a new program that allows local health departments to request vaccines to use innovatively through strategies to reach Black and brown communities. And today, we’re announcing that we’re providing more vaccines to upcoming Pride events across the country.”Daskalakis and Fenton then went on to address questions about how they will be funding their program, saying they have plenty of money to launch their efforts. However, they implied that additional funding may be required to keep their fight going.“So we have enough money right now to make the key decisions we need to make. But as this progresses, we need to replenish what we’ve used and be able to have additional funding to keep the fight going,” Fenton said. “The low hanging fruit has been gotten. The folks who are early adopters for this vaccine have gotten it. And now we’re really on to the next level, which is making sure that that everyone who needs it gets it.”The White House had previously requested $4.5 billion to combat the spread of the virus.","Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, right, White House Monkeypox response deputy coordinator, speaks alongside Bob Fenton, White House Monkeypox response coordinator, during a press briefing at the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2022, in Washington.

ESG stands for Environmental Social Corporate Governance and is spearheaded by powerful investment firms like BlackRock. ESG seeks to foist climate and social causes upon corporations – and punish them by giving them low “scores” for such measurements and fossil fuel usage or support for Black Lives Matter and corporate stances on abortion. The rise of ESG by powerful money actors has been slammed by critics as the hijacking of the private sector for political purposes. ESG is an illegal leftist scheme for circumventing democratic processes to impose arbitrarily-determined standards on companies in order to hijack the free enterprise system for political purposes.@BlackRock is a leader in ESG illegality.https://t.co/RDZzw3Y6lD— Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) September 8, 2022The result of this activist metric on Wall Street has sparked one of the most consequential ideological wars of our time. Spearheading that war in the resistance as west Virginia’s Attorney General, Patrick Morrisey, who penned a letter last month along with 19 other States Attorneys General. The letter sought from BlackRock more transparency in how it is implementing ESG in their respective states.Morrisey tells OAN, West Virginia has blacklisted firms like Blackrock and JP Morgan and others until these firms can better assure the state they will not punish companies for their fossil fuel use.“They’re trying to move to a radical green new deal perspective, where you start to get rid of all of the fossil fuels.” Morrisey says his state has pushed back – and won – in the courts but as a result, woke capitalism has found a backdoor towards pushing their climate and social agenda.“What they couldn’t get through the government they’re trying to get and to push through this ESG idea” says Morrisey, “to try to transform these companies to not only being profit making enterprises, but to advance their political goals as well.”Nearly one month after Morrisey’s letter to Blackrock – the firm this week responded. Denying that ESG was a means to push a political agenda and that Blackrock favors companies that support “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” That this push was driven not by political agenda but because transitioned companies are “better long term investments.”Morrisey responded to this letter in an OAN exclusive: “I don’t think it’s a credible response for a couple reasons. Their CEO has been very clear that his view of the role of capitalism is to have transformative social economic change.”“They’ve been going after this issue for many years, and they know that the broader efforts have failed on the regulatory front. So now they’re trying to influence the securities exchange commission. They’re trying to influence a lot of the state pension boards in order to adopt their view of the universe with respect to ESG. And that doesn’t work for most of America and especially West Virginia.”Morrisey says Blackrock is being disingenuous in their response and that his office has seen evidence contradicting their defensive claims this week. ",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Biden’s Mixed Messaging Attacking Trump Republicans — Tiny RalliesTOPICS:BlackrockESGmorriseynewsOANOANNpoliticsWall Street SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/blackrock-defends-woke-esg-capitalism-wv-ag-morrisey-hits-back/

The DOJ claimed that allowing a special master to take the time to review the documents could irreparably cause harm to the investigation.Following the DOJ’s announcement, Trump said that the department was wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on the appeal. Trump also claimed the agency is asking for his trust despite spying on his campaign and lying to federal courts in order to obtain FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) warrants. He argued that the search warrant itself was over-broad and that the judge ruled that he could be harmed by improper disclosure of sensitive information seized. Trump said the judge who signed the order was very brave and that the judge’s wise words have rang throughout the nation.The 45th President finished out his thoughts by saying the DOJ would rather waste money on this than use it to fight back against actual corruption in the government.","Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022.

While speaking at a DNC rally in Maryland on Thursday, Biden lambasted the MAGA movement. He described the members of the movement to be full of hated and division.Joe Biden on MAGA Republicans: ""They threaten our very democracy."" pic.twitter.com/euAZQN36me— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 9, 2022This comes in spite of his own party advocating for political violence.  Their rhetoric on police led to the Black Lives Matter riots in 2020. Vice President Kamala Harris encouraged the so-called fiery but mostly peaceful protests.“But the extreme set of MAGA Republicans has chosen to go backwards,” Biden claimed. “Full of anger, violence, hate and division. And that’s what their game is. And together, Democrats, Independents and mainstream Republicans can choose a different path forward to a future of unity and hope and some optimism and choose. We choose the Democrats to build a better America, and we have such an opportunity to do it.”The self-proclaimed “great uniter” then went on to claim that America First Republicans will attempt to pass a national ban on abortion if they regain control despite the overturn of Roe v. Wade putting the decision in the hands of the States. However, Biden failed to mention that his administration was already exploring options to circumvent the Supreme Court’s decision such as suing states like Idaho for banning the procedure.“If they win control of the House and Senate, they made it clear they’re going to try to pass a national ban. But as long as I’m president, they’re going to get it done because I’ll veto it,” the Democrat said. “Look. If they had their way, it won’t matter where you live. In America, women won’t have a right to choose anywhere, anywhere. I’m not going to let that happen. I really mean that. If they had their way, they’d come after the contraception and marriage equality, the whole right to privacy. They were very straightforward when this passed.”Biden also reiterated his disdain for the Second Amendment by invoking the locations of several mass shootings. The Democrat said he is determined to ban so-called assault weapons, saying he will do it for children whose deaths remain unreported due to mass shootings.Joe Biden: ""I'm determined to ban assault weapons."" pic.twitter.com/LXMFfxUuRa— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 8, 2022This remark comes as a majority of these deaths relating to guns are being reported in mostly Democrat run cities such as Chicago and New York. These cities have very stringent gun control laws in place.“I’m determined to ban assault weapons,” Biden announced. “I did it once before. And we’re going to do it again. We’re going to do it for those families in Buffalo and Nevada, Newtown, El Paso, Parkland, Charleston, Las Vegas, Orlando. I met with those families. Virtually every one of them over these years. It’s devastating what happened to them. Ladies and gentlemen, we’re going to do it all for those kids. We got gunned down on the streets every single day and never get recorded.” Biden’s rhetoric has become increasingly more partisan in the lead up to November’s midterms in which multiple MAGA Republicans are vying for seats in Congress.","President Joe Biden speaks during the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, Friday, Sept. 9, 2022.

The DEA says it could be a new strategy used by the cartels to make it look like candy to children and younger people.“By allowing the cartels to have control of our border Joe Biden’s policy, we are allowing the cartels with the help of a CCP in China to kill more than a hundred thousand of our citizens,” Lake said. “And I think the numbers are going to go up.”The National Institute on Drug Abuse explains fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Lake says she feels a motherly urge to protect the state’s children. “I found out that last year in Arizona, thirty-three children died from fentanyl poisoning,” said Lake. “Seven of them were under the age of one. I’m a mother and I can’t live with that. I just can’t allow that to happen in our state anymore.” Lake called fentanyl “a weapon of mass destruction.”“We need to treat the cartels as terrorists,” said Lake. “That’s what they are. And we need to treat this fentanyl crisis for what it is: a national security crisis and a national health crisis.”",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png," Legal Nonprofit: Michigan Unwilling To Purge ‘25,000’ Dead People On Voter RollsTOPICS:Arizonakari lakenewsOANOANNpolitics SHARETWEETPINSHARE",https://www.oann.com/lake-fentanyl-poisoning-american-young-adults/

McCabe — OAN National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 12:02 PM PT – Friday, September 9, 2022(Tallahassee, Fla.) Florida Republican Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis got a huge validation for his schools agenda with Friday’s release of the Heritage Foundation’s inaugural 2022 Education Freedom Report Card.The Washington-based Heritage Foundation rated Sunshine State schools No. 1 in the country, and it was the only state to rank in the top 10 in all four categories.Florida was ranked first in transparency, second in regulatory freedom, third in school choice, and seventh in return on spending.Heritage ranked Arizona second and Idaho third.DeSantis has committed to reforming Florida schools, both administratively and politically. The governor barnstormed the state in support of conservative school board candidates, and with the help of the 1776 Project PAC and Moms for Liberty flipped five county school boards from leftist control.Speaking at a rally for his endorsed candidates in Jacksonville, the governor said he was pushing leftwing political education out of the schools, in favor of education-education.“I don’t remember ideology being injected into my school. I just learned basic subjects. But now you have a situation in which so many people, they want to use our school system not to educate kids, they want to indoctrinate kids,” he said.“Two plus two equals four. It’s not two plus two, and how does that make you feel? Or is that an injustice?” he said.“You saw us do that by passing a curriculum transparency legislation that I signed, I guess it was probably about four or five months ago at this point, guaranteeing the right of every parent in Florida to know what’s being taught to their kids in school, to know what textbooks are being used,” the governor said. “You’d think that would be a no-brainer.”Heritage ranked District of Columbia schools 51st in the nation, chased by New York, 50th and New Jersey 49th.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png," DeSantis Debrief: Fla.
