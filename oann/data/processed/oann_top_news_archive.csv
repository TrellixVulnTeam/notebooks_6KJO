The Republican lawmaker further criticized the board saying, “leave it to Democrats to think free speech is the problem and more government is the solution.”Here’s how the White House is responding:“What I can tell you is that it sounds like the objective of the board is to prevent disinformation and misinformation from traveling around the country in a range of communities,” said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. “I’m not sure who opposes that effort.”Few details have been released about the this new board.","FILE – Homeland Security logo is seen during a joint news conference in Washington, Feb. 25, 2015.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:28 AM PT – Friday, April 29, 2022President Joe Biden recently touted his economy as the GDP continues to shrink under his watch. On Thursday, the Democrat met with small business leaders to praise his administration contribution to the backbone of America. Biden noted the important role smaller enterprises play in the economy.“Small businesses typically account for more than 40 percent,” he stated. “People don’t realize that 40 percent of the gross domestic product in the United States, they create two-thirds of all new jobs. They employ nearly half, nearly half, of all the private sector workers.”Biden did not, however, mention the toll inflation and surging fuel prices has taken on the country’s entrepreneurs. A Goldman Sachs survey of 10,000 small business owners found 80 percent of respondents claimed to have suffered under the burden of inflation in the past six months. Furthermore, 60 percent of those surveyed said they had no choice but to pass those costs on to their customers.However, Biden instead pointed to government aid as a saving grace of ailing businesses. He specifically praised his American Rescue Plan, which some economist believe kick started the country’s inflationary problem. The former vice president then pivoted to criticize the economic model proposed by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), which he claimed would hurt small businesses.“Not only do they oppose making big corporations pay their fair share, they want middle class families and small business owners to pay more,” Biden claimed. “Our administration estimates that the Republican proposal would raise taxes on 6.1 million small business owners, including 82 percent of small business owners who earn less than $50,000 a year. It is just not right.”In response, a spokesperson for Sen. Scott said Biden could learn a thing or two from the Republican. As the governor of Florida, Scott cut taxes 100 times during his tenure and balanced his state’s budget. In contrary, the Biden White House has overseen rising inflation, surging gas prices and costs for necessary goods..@JoeBiden keeps lying, but the American people aren’t buying it. As long as Biden & the Democrats are working to destroy this great country, I’ll be fighting to rescue it. Read my full statement ⬇️ https://t.co/dCKgCqtYKg— Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) April 28, 2022Additionally, former Papa John’s CEO John Schnatter said Biden has put his heel on the neck of small businesses with over regulation, an artificial labor shortage and an overall hostility to entrepreneurialism. Meanwhile, a recent Commerce Department report shows the US economy shrank by 1.4 percent in the past quarter.","President Joe Biden speaks about the war in Ukraine in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, Thursday, April 28, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:01 AM PT – Friday, April 29, 2022A 22-year-old US Marine was reportedly killed fighting in Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces. Family members of Willy Joseph Cancel said they were told he died on Monday.At the time of his death, he was working with a private military contracting company. According to his family, the company was apparently hiring people to fight in the war, which led Cancel to fly to Poland in March.“He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn’t come here,” explained his mother, Rebecca Cabrera. “And that maybe our American soldiers wouldn’t have to be involved in it.”At this time, Cancel’s body has not been recovered. He leaves behind a wife and 7-month-old baby.“He went there wanting help people, he had always felt that was his main mission in life,” said the Marine’s wife, Brittany Cancel. “My husbands was very brave and a hero. I did not expect to be a widow at 23-years-old or for our son to be without a father. All I want is for him to come home and to give the proper burial he deserves.”A State Department official said they are aware of these reports and are closely monitoring the situation. The official also reiterated that US citizens “should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of US citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials.”It's being reported that a former U.S. Marine, Willy Joseph Cancel, was killed fighting for Ukraine. He was just 22.

A new federal report finds that record-keeping failures by the Education Department may have left thousands of Americans stuck with student debt that should have been forgiven. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:33 AM PT – Friday, April 29, 2022The Biden administration is taking a hard look at student loan relief. During a press conference Thursday, Joe Biden said $50,000 in debt reduction is not on the table, shutting down a mounting push from progressives.“I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction, but I’m in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness, ” stated the President. “And I’ll have an answer on that in the next couple of weeks.”Biden instead touted the steps he has taken while suggesting his administration reformed a system in place that didn’t work. During his 2020 campaign, The Democrat vowed to “immediately cancel at least $10,000 in relief per the nation’s roughly 43 million borrowers, which would forgive $321 billion in federal student loans.“In terms of the loan forgiveness, there is no simple solution here,” said Miguel Cardona, Secretary of Education. “But we do know our borrowers need relief do need relief.” This came shortly after a group of five Republican senators introduced the Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act, which would ban Biden from cancelling student debt. This measure is led by Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) who claims deferring student loan payments is costing the government money it doesn’t have.“My legislation…would continued to allow our president to temporarily suspend student loan payments during a future national emergency but would limit those suspension to a period of 90 days and subject them to income congressional disapproval. It would also endure that relief is targeted to those who need it most by preventing presidents from suspending payments to higher income individuals.”The measure would also prevent any future president from using a national emergency to cancel student loan debt. Thune said as Americans return to the workforce since the start of the pandemic, it’s time to resume repayments.","FILE – People walk on the campus at Stanford University in Stanford, Calif.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:10 AM PT – Friday, April 29, 2022The United States Postal Service is facing legal trouble as 16 states are suing them. Three lawsuits were filed in New York and California Thursday in an effort to stop the Postal Service from purchasing thousands of gas powered trucks.The complaints allege that the mail service made an error in its decision to replace its current fleet with roughly 165,000 trucks with only 10 percent consisting of battery electric vehicles. Instead, the attorneys general want the mail service to only purchase electric vehicles to be more environmentally friendly.University of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias weighed in on the lawsuits.“Sixteen attorneys general from states across the country and environmental organizations sued the Postal Service because they said that the decision to use so few electric vehicles in the new fleet of trucks didn’t take sufficient account of the environmental consequences of the decision that was made,” he stated.The lawsuits also claims that as a result of such a decision, there was a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires an environmental impact statement before undertaking a massive enterprise like the commitment to buy these vehicles. Additionally, the complaints call for a thorough review of the environmental impacts such a move would have.“They’re hoping to persuade the judges who hear the cases that the USPS just had it wrong and needs to go back and have a proper decision making process, which I think the plaintiffs believe should result in a much lower percentage of gas powered vehicles and a much higher percentage of electric vehicles,” explained Tobias. “If they were to dictate the choices, but I think they believe if a proper environmental review has done that that would appropriate outcome.”However, the Postal Service is defending its actions with a spokesperson for USPS saying they “conducted a robust and thorough review and fully complied with all of their obligations under the national environmental policy act.”Despite the push for electric powered delivery vehicles, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has said repeatedly that the Postal Service does not have the funding to increase the number of electric vehicles in its fleet.","United States Postal Service trucks sit outside the Roberto Clemente Post Office August 25, 2009 in Chicago, Illinois.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:48 AM PT – Thursday, April 28, 2022House lawmakers grilled Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas during his testimony in front of the House Appropriations Committee.During his testimony Wednesday, Mayorkas claimed the department would not lose operational control of the border in light of Title 42 being lifted.. . and called the current migrant surge a challenge faced by the entire world.“The challenge congressman of migration is not a challenge the United States faces alone,” he stated. “What we are experiencing is a migration challenge throughout the region, throughout the Western Hemisphere and, in fact, through out the world. And that is why one of the pillars of the plan is to work with countries south of our border, so they manage their borders effectively.”Additionally, Mayorkas fielded questions about how he will be handling refugees escaping from Ukraine amid the ongoing crisis. According to DHS Secretary, they have begun the implementation of a multipart plan to address that issue.“For the Ukrainians who have fled Ukraine in a time of a brutal war, we have established a multipart plan,” he explained. “Number one is our traditional refugee processing and we deployed refugee affairs officers to the region to administer that. Number two, the Department of State issued guidance with respect to the availability of visas for Ukrainian nationals who qualify. Third, we announced this past Monday Uniting for Ukraine, a special humanitarian parole program that requires a sponsor here in the United States.”Mayorkas then went on to outline his plan to implement “regional solutions” to what he claims are the root causes of mass migration.“And we have to, of course, address the root causes,” he stated. “We have to build safe, humane and orderly pathways. We have to equip and enable countries to enforce their borders, to provide humanitarian relief where it is warranted, to repatriate individuals where it is not.”Despite his comprehensive plan, House representatives from both sides of the aisle remain skeptical of his handling of the southern border. This hearing came after US Customs and Border Protection reported more than 2 million border encounters since Joe Biden took office with the latest report showing over 221,000 in March alone.","Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, on Capitol Hill, Thursday, April 28, 2022, in Washington.

In an interview with Piers Morgan that aired Monday, Donald Trump asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin is only threatening nuclear options because the US isn’t being tough enough.Trump went on to say Putin uses the word “nuclear” on a daily basis, adding he’s only doing it more and more because it is stirring up fear. When asked what he would do if he were in Joe Biden’s shoes, Trump said he would remind Putin of the extent of US military capabilities.“I would say, we have far more than you do…far, far more powerful than you,” he stated. “And you can’t use that word ever again. You cannot use the nuclear word ever again. And if you do, we’re gonna have problems.”""We have better weapons… I would say we have far more than you do.

McCarthy leads delegation of GOP reps. to southern borderMigrants walk on a dirt road after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, Tuesday, March 23, 2021, in Mission, Texas. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:39 AM PT – Tuesday, April 26, 2022House Republicans are demanding President Joe Biden pick up the pieces of the deteriorating situation at the southern border. On Monday, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) led a group of Republicans to Eagle Pass, Texas, where he said the Biden administration has lost its grip on border security.The California lawmaker said the President’s open border rhetoric is welcoming illegal immigrants and people on the federal terror watch list into the US. He also derided the Biden administration’s push to end Title 42 and its move to give migrants phones, so federal agents can “check in” on them as they await immigration court proceedings.McCarthy further lamented that border security is an issue that should be handled by the federal government, but instead those leading the efforts are officials at the state level.“I want to to tell Governor (Greg) Abbott thank you,” he stated. “It’s a job you shouldn’t have to do, but you bringing the National Guard and others here as a determent to try to protect our borders because of what this President’s actions have done.”The delegation also touched on the human toll of the Biden border crisis. They mourned the death of specialist Bishop Evans of the Texas National Guard who died trying to help an illegal migrant stuck in the Rio Grande.Additionally, Texas Rep. Chip Roy claimed Americans are dying from fentanyl coming in from Mexico and others are dying from cartel-run human smuggling operations. Roy added, however, the human toll doesn’t just affect Americans.“We’ve gotta actually do the hard work of having a sovereign nation secure a border so migrants don’t get killed,” he stated. “The 700 to 1,000 that are in body trailers that local officials have to go rent to put bodies in, the ranchers who find dead bodies on their property, the bodies we find in the river on a daily basis.”Meanwhile, Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales touted the Republican stance on border security, adding all members are unified behind the issue. He urged members from all political affiliations to come together while stressing border security is not a partisan issue.“Everybody in this crisis, everybody’s world is turned upside down,” said Gonzales. “We’ve heard from ranchers that their kids can’t go out and play. They have to carry pistols when they walk their properties. their childhoods have been stolen. people’s lives have been stolen. This is about bringing everyone together. It starts with keeping Title 42.”“We have answers, we have solutions to some of these issues. It starts with Title 42…The admin wanted to do away with Title 42 a year ago, and the Republican Party fought them every inch of the way. Here we are a year later” @RepTonyGonzales on ending the #BidenBorderCrisis pic.twitter.com/yonFFnrHXw— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) April 25, 2022In the meantime, Republican state attorneys general from Missouri, Louisiana and Arizona earned a victory on keeping Title 42 in place as a judge granted a temporary restraining order that bars the Biden administration from killing the health measure.Additionally, leader McCarthy warned he could make a push to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of the southern border. Mayorkas is expected to testify three times in front of Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.Leader McCarthy Hammers Biden at the Border in Eagle Pass, Texas:﻿","Migrants walk on a dirt road after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, Tuesday, March 23, 2021, in Mission, Texas.

The President took the stage and attempted to drum up enthusiasm for the bipartisan infrastructure bill by bragging about how he wrote the original version with “his own paw.”“Through the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which I might add I wrote the original one with my own paw, I wrote it…because I was convinced there was no other answer other than beginning to invest in our country again,” he stated.Biden continued to explain his infrastructure plans, saying this year $25 billion will be invested to modernize airports across the country with Oregon getting $211 million in funds.“Because of the infrastructure law we are going to see modern baggage claim area, improved taxiways and yes better escalators,” Biden continued.However, some of the logistics of the bipartisan infrastructure law came into question when he suddenly appeared to lose his train of thought. Meanwhile, Biden continued his Pacific Northwest trip having arrived in Seattle, Washington on Thursday.﻿","President Joe Biden speaks about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after unveiling his proposed budget for fiscal year 2023 in the State Dining Room of the White House, Monday, March 28, 2022, in Washington.

Additionally, the multi-state effort will monitor cyber security issues, target cartel finances that fund criminal activity in the border regions and improve efforts to combat drug trafficking on the nation’s southernmost cross country highway.Today I have joined 25 of my fellow Governors in forming the American Governors’ Border Strike Force.Wyoming will continue to offer support to our southern border while the Biden Administration sits idly by and fails to take action on this crisis. https://t.co/V75sFuY8WB— Governor Mark Gordon (@GovernorGordon) April 19, 2022Governor Ducey stressed that if the southern border is not secure, the rest of America is not either.“The border problem just isn’t in the four border states,” he stated, “There are kids ODing on fentanyl all over our country, in schools and neighborhoods. It’s one of the leading causes of death. People that are addicted, people that are looking for a cheap high and that’s coming over our southern border. But it’s happening in small towns and rural communities in the interior. That’s what the Border Strike Force is: to share information, stop the cartels and stop the human trafficking.”The Arizona governor suggested federal agencies must step forward with local law enforcement. In the meantime, he said the Biden administration must do their part to crack down on the crisis they created.President Biden has failed to secure the border, so Republican Governors are launching a Border Strike Force to secure our communities.South Dakota has sent National Guard to the border.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, Pool)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:26 AM PT – Wednesday, April 20, 2022Top US diplomats are scrambling to simmer tensions in the Middle East amid recent violent attacks in Jerusalem. During a press conference Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said several officials contacted their counterparts in Israel, Palestine and other Arab countries to make sure there is no escalation.Over the weekend, more than 170 Palestinians were reportedly injured by Israeli police near the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. Police officers said they were provoked by protesters who were allegedly setting off fireworks toward the officers as well as throwing stones and other objects at them.In recent weeks, Israel has faced a slew of knife and gun attacks from Palestinian suspects, which have prompted a heavy-handed response from police.“We are deeply concerned by the recent violence in Jerusalem on the Haram al-Sharif Temple Mount and across the West Bank, Price stated. “We also continue to urge Israeli and Palestinian officials to work cooperatively to lower tensions and ensure the safety of everyone.”Additionally, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett denounced the recent attacks on his people while asserting they are at the hands of Iran-backed terrorist group Hamas. He said his military intercepted a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip on Monday and stressed it’s the first time Hamas launched a rocket from a Palestinian territory.“This is unacceptable to us,” Bennett stated. “This is a reward for the inciters, especially Hamas, which are trying to ignite violence in Jerusalem. We will not allow this to happen. The State of Israel will continue to provide for and safeguard the dignity of all of us to enable everyone to celebrate in Jerusalem, and – most of all – our forces will continue to provide security for the citizens of the State of Israel.”Meanwhile, adversaries to Israel are ramping up their incendiary rhetoric against the country. After launching two deadly attacks in Israel last month, ISIS has called on supporters to carry out more attacks while also urging violent attacks in Europe.Additionally, Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi threatened to strike the heart of Israel if the Jewish State makes the slightest move against it. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps also vowed to protect Palestinians from alleged anti-Palestine attacks from Israel.“Our armed forces have today, after the imposed war, rebuilt themselves in a way that today our military might is not only noteworthy in the region, but in the world,” Raisi stated.In the meantime, spokesman Price is urging Israeli forces to use restraint when responding to attacks, ensuring diplomatic phone calls will de-escalate the situation. Experts are calling on Israel and the Arab world to continue to abide by the 2020 Abraham Accords to build off the historic meeting held late last month.","State Department spokesman Ned Price speaks during a news conference at the State Department, Thursday, March 10, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:11 AM PT – Wednesday, April 20, 2022A Michigan judge denied the parents of Ethan Crumbley their request to have their bonds reduced from $500,000 to $100,000. Crumbley’s parents have been charged with involuntary manslaughter after their son allegedly carried out a mass shooting at his high school. The couple’s attorney filed a request to have their bonds reduced after the pair were arrested in Detroit last year.“The defendants’ own actions leading up to their arrest make the current bond appropriate,” stated Oakland County Judge Cheryl Matthews. “Therefore, I am denying defendants’ motion to reduce the bond.”Additionally, Judge Matthews determined that the couple’s actions after the deadly shooting was a premeditated attempt to conceal their location from law enforcement. The pair were found to have fled their home in the aftermath of the incident when local authorities issued a warrant for their arrest.“Upon a warrant being issued, law enforcement is not required to make an appointment with a defendant,” noted the judge. “It is the job of the police to ensure a swift, safe and secure arrest. And this court believes that would have happened but for the defendants’ actions. The defendants’ actions were premeditated to conceal their whereabouts.”In the meantime, Judge Matthews has scheduled the two for a jury trial later this year in October.“Some of the judges in the courthouse are trying cases where individuals have been in jail 700 days and that would not be my intent if your matter goes to trial,” she explained. “I would give you the speediest trial possible. However, if there’s a mistrial because of some conflict that during a trial, we’d be back at square one so I want to avoid all that.”The couple’s attorney has indicated they will be filing an appeal in order to have their bonds reduced and to request for a change in venue for their trial. They will also be filing other motions related to medical records and other pieces of evidence.","Jennifer and James Crumbley, the parents of Ethan Crumbley, a teenager accused of killing four students in a shooting at Oxford High School, appear in court for a preliminary examination on involuntary manslaughter charges in Rochester Hills, Mich., Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2022.

During a White House press briefing on Monday, Secretary Jen Psaki said negotiations on a new spending bill are underway and they include a number of Democrat lawmakers.These efforts come despite Republicans noting that multi-trillion dollar deficits caused by last year’s spending packages led to record-high inflation. However, Psaki said President Joe Biden is committed to more spending. To do so, the Biden administration will have to win over moderate Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.Democrats previously suggested the failed Build Back Better bill could be renamed in another attempt to pass it through Congress this year. However, it appears that simply renaming the bill might be enough as senators Sinema and Manchin maintain they will not support the bill unless it’s trimmed down.During a recent Arizona Chamber of Commerce speech, Sinema warned she will be just as critical of the bill in potential future discussions as she was last year. Meanwhile, Manchin has continued to voice inflation concerns and has said he wants half of any new revenue from a spending bill to go toward deficit reduction.Remember, as bad as inflation is today, Joe Biden tried to spend an additional *$4,900,000,000,000* on his ""Build Back Better"" slush fund.This would have made our record inflation even worse. pic.twitter.com/FbFR9BDPpI— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) April 12, 2022Looking ahead, the Biden administration and Democrat lawmakers have yet to set a firm deadline for when they want to get a revived deal.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:17 AM PT – Tuesday, April 19 2022Vice President Kamala Harris declared the US will not conduct anti-satellite missile tests. She made the announcement while speaking at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Monday. The Democrat voiced concerns of the possible debris created when the missiles hit their intended targets, which could rain down upon unsuspecting victims on earth or harm astronauts in orbit.Harris specifically referenced past uses of the projectiles by America’s two largest rivals in space: Russia and China. Back in November, Russia targeted a defunct satellite, which created more than 1,500 pieces of debris and posed a danger to the International Space Station.“That, of course, is when Russia launched a missile to destroy a satellite in space,” said Harris. “It is called a destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile test. In 2007, China conducted a similar test.”Harris went on to chastise the Russians and Chinese for operating in space without any regard for American interests.“These weapons are intended to deny the United States, our ability to use our space capabilities, by disrupting, destroying our satellites,” she asserted. “Satellites which are critical to our national security. These tests, to be sure, are reckless and they are irresponsible”.The US is the first country to ban anti-satellite missile tests and is calling upon other countries to join the boycott of such operations. However, some believe the good intentions can have dire consequences.Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), the House Armed Services Committee’s top Republican, said the ban does nothing to deter Russia or China from continuing such tests. He claimed the US is putting itself at a serious disadvantage in a theater for future warfare.Additionally, the top Republican in the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), called the decision a national security threat. He said the US is purposely stripping itself of increasing its capabilities in outer space.Vice President Harris Delivers Remarks About Our Ongoing Work to Establish Norms for Space:﻿","Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House complex in Washington, Wednesday, April 13, 2022, on the Biden administration’s whole-of-government approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:53 AM PT – Tuesday, April 19 2022Pentagon spokesman John Kirby spoke on increased US involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. During a press briefing on Monday, he disclosed that Russia has begun moving their forces to the Donbas region of the country.“I mean, we have seen the Russians continue to flow in enablers, capabilities that will help them fight in the Donbas going forward,” explained the spokesman. “That’s artillery, rotary aviation helicopter support, command and control enablers. And we do believe that they have reinforced the number of battalion tactical groups in the east and the south of Ukraine.”Additionally, Kirby spoke on the latest shipments of military aid sent to Ukraine.“Now again, I’m not going to get into the inventory list and exactly what was on that first shipment, but that is unprecedented speed,” he stated. “Forty-eight hours after authorization from the President, first plane was on its way and there have been subsequent shipments since then. Almost a half a dozen, as you and I speak here today, have already arrived in the region.”48 hours. From Presidential authorization on April 13th, to the first shipments departing on April 15th.

According to Kirby, the training will be held in an undisclosed location outside of Ukraine.“It is true that we believe will be able to begin a process of training Ukrainian armed forces on the howitzers that will be shortly heading over,” continued the Pentagon spokesman. “That training will occur outside of Ukraine. It’ll be more of a train the trainers kind of environment, so it will be a small number of Ukrainians that will be trained on the howitzers and then they will be reintroduced back into their country to train their colleagues.”It’s unknown if Russia will adhere to their warning about punishing the US for supplying Ukraine with equipment.","Pentagon spokesman John Kirby speaks during a media briefing at the Pentagon, Monday, April 18, 2022, in Washington.

On Sunday, a video was released showing military personnel loading boxes of military equipment into an airplane headed for the war-torn country.This latest delivery to Ukraine is part of the $800 million package announced by the Biden administration. The shipment was made despite warnings from Russia about the possible consequences for supplying Ukraine. Meanwhile, a former commander of the US Army in Europe, Ben Hodges, said President Joe Biden should send more weapons to Ukraine.In an interview Sunday, he explained that he believes Russian forces are going to launch a new offensive against the Ukrainian government. His remarks came after an NBC News report found the Ukraine fighters may run out of artillery shells and other weapons in coming days. Hodges added, US weapons sent to Ukraine may not be enough to fight Russia.“This is substantial high-quality weapons system, but I have to say it’s still not enough,” he stated. “What the Ukrainians need desperately are long range fires, rockets, artillery, drones that can disrupt or destroy the systems that are causing so much damage in Ukrainian cities.”Hodges went on to say the Biden administration is not talking about winning in Ukraine’s conflict and its further plans remain unclear. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president said Biden should make a diplomatic visit to his country.During an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday, Volodymyr Zelensky stated he thinks Biden will pay a visit, adding it’s something he should do as the leader of the United States. His remarks came after the White House said Biden did not have any plans on traveling to Kyiv just last week.The Ukrainians have the courage of a lion.President @ZelenskyyUa has given the roar of that lion.The UK stands unwaveringly with the people of Ukraine.Slava Ukraini 🇬🇧 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/u6vGYqmK4V— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) April 9, 2022Biden also expressed disappointment about not being able to visit while in Poland last month, saying “they won’t let me.” Several other leaders have visited the Ukrainian capital, including UK Prime Minster Boris Johnson and the presidents of both Lithuania and Poland.","FILE – In this image provided by the U.S. Air Force, Airmen and civilians from the 436th Aerial Port Squadron palletize ammunition, weapons and other equipment bound for Ukraine during a foreign military sales mission at Dover Air Force Base, Del., on Jan. 21, 2022.

Early Thursday morning, a charter bus dropped off dozens of passengers near Capitol Hill, just one block from Union Station.They were questioned by Capitol Police then released into the city. This is part of Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s (R) plan to combat Joe Biden’s failing border policies. Abbott said the move will allow Biden to “more immediately” address the needs of the people he’s allowing into the country.On Wednesday, just hours after the first bus of migrants arrived in D.C., White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki doubled down on her criticism of Abbott’s plan.“Well, these are all migrants who have been processed by CBP and are free to travel, so it’s nice the state of Texas is helping them get to their final destination as they await in their outcome of their immigration proceedings,” she remarked. “And they’re all in immigration proceedings.”Secretary Psaki then pointed the finger at Abbott for doing “enhanced safety inspections” at several Texas ports along the southern border. The governor has stepped up measures at the southern border to force administratio officals to take action amid the crisis, but Psaki played it off as a political stunt.#OperationLoneStar continues to fill in the gaps left by the Biden Administration to secure the border. Recent highlights include surpassing 11K felony charges & the first two buses of unlawful migrants arriving in Washington, D.C. More details: https://t.co/ioYa0ckYf4 https://t.co/uV5JDlLtGU— Gov.

(Michael A. McCoy/Pool via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:35 AM PT – Wednesday, April 13, 2022Secretary of State Antony Blinken says democratic principles are on the decline around the world while human rights abuses are on the rise. The US State Department issued a dire warning about the state of democracy in several countries.While speaking about the department’s 46th Annual Report on Human Rights Practices in nearly 200 countries around the world, Secretary Blinken said there was a trend in backsliding in 2021.“For many years running, we have seen an alarming recession of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights in many parts of the world,” he stated. “In the time since releasing our previous report, that backsliding has unfortunately continued.”The report detailed the humanitarian crisis that happened during and after the Biden administration withdrew from Afghanistan. Since American troops left the Central Asian country, the Taliban has increased its arbitrary killings, detention and forced disappearances of political dissidents. Additionally, antigovernmental groups, including the Taliban and ISIS-K, punished civilians through beatings, amputations and executions.Department of State researchers also pointed out the ruling Taliban has rolled back efforts to educate the Afghan people, lamenting access to education was bolstered prior to the surrender.“We invest so much effort into documenting these and other abuses year after year, not only because it aligns our most sacred values, but also because respect for human rights is fundamental part of upholding the international rules based order,” he stated.Secretary Blinken also noted under President Biden’s watch, authoritarian regimes are taking their human rights abuses beyond their borders. He touched on the Iranian plot to kidnap a US-based journalist who was critical of the Ayatollah regime from her home in New York.Also, Belarusian-Russian officials ordered a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania to land in its capital, so they could arrest a 26-year-old exile who had orchestrated protests against Lukashenko regime.Additionally, the report warned China is continuing its human rights abuses that the US has been sounding the alarm on for years. The Chinese Communist Party is still perpetrating genocidal actions against Uyghur Muslims in its Xinjiang province.According to the report, CCP officials have also launched a censorship campaign against dissident areas, including shutting down news papers promoting democracy in Hong Kong and sending military planes to Taiwan to thwart independence claims.“And we know that the way to do it matters, together with citizens and communities out in the open transparently, not trying to pretend problems don’t exist or sweeping them under a rug,” Blinken continued, “And in fact, that’s what distinguishes democracies: our willingness, our commitment to pursue that more perfect union. In practicing what we preach at home, gives us greater legitimacy when we encourage governments abroad to do the same thing.”In the meantime, the US Secretary of State said he will work to bolster America’s human rights practices, so it can better lead by example. He vowed to continue meeting with human rights activists and journalists abroad as well as continue to sanction countries that continue to violate their citizens’ human rights.﻿","U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during the fourth U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue at the State Department in Washington, Monday, April 11, 2022.

President Joe Biden has continued to blame inflation on Russia, although prices had been soaring for several months before the Ukraine crisis.Biden gave a speech in Iowa on Tuesday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed U.S. inflation rate accelerated to 8.5 percent in March. The BLS also said inflation rose just 1.2 percent from a month prior while most of price increases took place before February.

Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) said the Biden administration may be under-counting inflation that plagues America.DeSantis said on Tuesday that prices are rising significantly above the Labor Department’s latest reading of 8.5 percent. The governor said households are suffering from the worst inflation in 40 years and it keeps going up every month. He added, the costs of energy and food are soaring through the roof due to economic policies by the Biden administration.Inflation is at a 40-year high of 8.5% due to federal policies of borrowing & printing money at unfathomable levels & bad energy policy, which is hurting Floridians.Biden could unleash domestic energy production to provide relief. Instead, he is content watching people suffer.— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) April 12, 2022DeSantis stressed the value of the US dollar has decreased due to multi-trillion spending packages. Looking ahead, the Florida governor said he’s using all available state resources to offset the effects of Biden’s policies, but state level efforts are not enough to contain inflation.","President Joe Biden speaks at POET Bioprocessing in Menlo, Iowa, Tuesday, April 12, 2022.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:14 AM PT – Wednesday, April 13, 2022Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) made good on his promise to pass constitutional carry legislation nearly three and a half years later. On Tuesday in Douglassville, the owner of Gable Sporting Goods, Rome Smith, kicked off the signing ceremony. He stated, “What this bill’s gonna do is it’s gonna make Georgia a safer place.”This bill will allow law abiding citizens to carry a concealed handgun without a permit in areas where firearms are permitted starting next year. Sen. Jason Annavitarte (R-Ga.) weighed in, saying the goal of this law is to empower law abiding citizens to defend themselves and their families while disempowering criminals.Governor Kemp signed the bill long after he pledged to make constitutional carry his top priority while in office during an interview with local media back in February 2019.“SB 319 makes sure that law abiding Georgians, law abiding Georgians including our daughters and your family too, can protect themselves without having to have permission from your state government,” he stated. “The Constitution of the United States gives us that right, not the government.”While many conservatives support constitutional carry, some Georgians like Kemp’s Trump-endorsed GOP competitor David Perdue didn’t miss the opportunity to take a jab at him.I’m proud to have President Trump’s Complete & Total Endorsement. Georgians are tired of do-nothing, weak-kneed politicians. As Governor, I’ll be a fighter, who never caves to the woke left.

Kevin Brady (R-Texas) recently criticized the Biden administration for poorly addressing economic issues. During an interview Tuesday, the Republican accused Biden of falling short by not addressing the worker shortage or creating incentives to encourage Americans to go back to work.Brady noted that instead, Biden talks about higher taxes “nearly every week,” which the congressman believes has a negative impact on Americans. The Texas lawmaker argued that suggested tax hikes are becoming a real problem for the economy. He stressed that it’s small business owners who are really worried.“We ought to be driving more investment in the US, especially along the supply chain, in new equipment, new technology, new innovation ought to be what the administration is championing,” Brady explained. “But they are still stuck on some form of Build Back Better and even if you look at the trimmed down versions, your talking about a trillion and a half dollars of tax hikes.”With inflation raging and getting worse, when will President Biden admit we’re in a dangerous wage-price spiral?The latest Consumer Price Index report showed that inflation continued to surge, rising 8.5% over last year—the highest increase in 40 years.My full statement 👇 pic.twitter.com/eVhgKEaQTO— Rep.

Their investigation began in 2010 when police received a call from a woman saying someone was trying to kill her.Over the course of their investigation, authorities discovered 10 sets of human remains. The new footage was revealed during a press conference and shows one of the victims, Megan Waterman, exiting a Holiday Inn.“The video shows several different angles from security cameras located in the lobby of a Holiday Inn Express located in Hauppauge and in the videos, which were recorded on June 4 to June 6 in 2010, our victim, Megan Waterman, was wearing a yellow sweater and is shown both arriving and leaving the hotel,” stated Rodney Harrison, Suffolk County Police Commissioner. “Based on what we know right now, we believe she did leave the hotel that night to meet her killer.”Additionally, they set up a website for people to turn in any information they have regarding the case. Police also doubled the reward for anyone who comes forward to assist their investigation.“We are doubling the reward for information that may lead to the arrest and conviction in the Gilgo Beach homicide investigation from $25,000 to $50,000,” Harrison announced. “This represents the highest Crime Stoppers reward in Suffolk County history.”The press conference ended with an attorney for one of the victims urging the public to assist them with solving the case by generating buzz around their community.“This is the first step, but it’s a very small baby step towards what should be done, which is to bring the public into this case,” attorney John Ray. “It’s the only way this will be solved. The only way. The killers are still there, they know it if they see things on the TV it will cause them to react as well.”The investigation is still ongoing with police expecting to release more evidence related to the case.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Families Of Fedex Shooting Victims File LawsuitTOPICS:crimeLong IslandMegan WatermanNew YorkRodney HarrisonSuffolk County Police TWEETPIN ,https://www.oann.com/long-island-police-release-video-evidence-in-gilgo-beach-murders/

While standing on the lawn of the Rose Garden, President Joe Biden announced the banning of unlicensed kits used to create the untraceable weapons.The new rule also includes a ban on the so-called Buy Build Shoot kits, which people can purchase online or at a store and assemble within 30-minutes. As a result, commercial manufacturers will be required to include a serial number on each kit and run a background check on the person prior to a sale.Critics were quick to dismiss the rule while claiming “the Constitution does not authorize the federal government to prevent a person from making their own firearm.” In railing against ghost guns, Biden showcased how easy it is to assemble one.‘If you buy a couch you have to assemble, it’s still a couch’ — Pres.

In a recent interview with America Rising’s political action committee, the Michigan congresswoman spoke out against President Joe Biden’s decision to lift the Trump-era Title 42 policy.Prior to the interview, Slotkin was supportive of amnesty and notably released a press release in 2019 stating her support against funding Trumps border wall. However, Slotkin now says she knows if Title 42 is lifted, more illegal immigrants will come to the US.“Right now we don’t have nearly as many people coming over the border as we usually would at this time because we have COVID restrictions on,” stated the congresswoman. “The minute those are lifted in May, it’s going to be again a series over overwhelmed border crossings and I can’t support that.

Department of Defense spokesperson John Kirby said during a press conference on Monday, U.S. Intelligence has found Russia is trying to re-supply its troops to prepare for a push in Eastern Ukraine.This comes after Russia pulled out its troops from the northern part of the country, including the capital Kyiv to Western Belarus and Western Russia. Kirby said it now appears those battalions are moving to the East.“It does seem to be a mix of of personnel carrying vehicles as well as armored vehicles and maybe some artillery, maybe some enabling capabilities,” he explained. “Not exactly clear, but this does seem to be an early effort by them to to reinforce their efforts in the Donbas.”NEWS: Russians Shifting Their Fighting Focus to Eastern Ukraine, Says DoD Official. https://t.co/JB84CVl5TI— Department of Defense 🇺🇸 (@DeptofDefense) April 11, 2022Earlier in the year, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized separatist forces in Donbas as independent states.

According to Rio Grand Valley Customs and Border Protection, 226 illegal immigrants were apprehended at a single crossing site within 24-hours. Border Patrol agents confirmed 126 migrants were recently caught in La Grulla, Texas and another group of 100 was detained at the exact same location a few hours later.Happening Now:Rio Grande City agents are currently in La Grulla, TX with a large group of 100+ migrants.Last night, RGC agents apprehended an additional 126 migrants in the same location. pic.twitter.com/OlkDgSaxsT— Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings (@USBPChiefRGV) April 8, 2022Immigration officials are sounding the alarm, saying the number of migrants storming the border is rising exponentially. The majority of those are caught and released into the U.S. under the Biden administration’s policies.In the midst of such events, Obama-era Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is defending Biden’s handling of the border crisis. In an interview Sunday, he endorsed the policy of addressing so-called “root causes” of migration by sending U.S. taxpayer money to Central American countries.Johnson also defended Biden ending the Title 42 rule, which barred migrants from entering the U.S. due to COVID-19. He also admitted the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border is rapidly increasing.The former White House official also suggested the U.S. could open mandatory vaccination sites for migrants at the border, but he admitted it’s hard to force-vaccinate such large numbers of migrants.However, Rep. Mike Rogers promised Republicans will use oversight powers to oblige Joe Biden to enforce border security. In a recent radio interview, Rogers said that it was time to shine a light on the actions of the administration. He said that the reason things are so bad, especially on the border, is because nobody is committed to oversight in Congress. Rogers said that will change when Republicans take back the majority. He’s confident the party will flip both chambers.“The Homeland Security Committee will be all over this when the Republicans are in control,” he stated. “We’ll be dragging folks from all over the administration in and making them testify about what’s happening. Making them explain why they think they don’t have to adhere to the law. There will be a bright light shined on what they’re doing.”The representative also said that the current influx of illegal migrants is draining schools and hospitals. He believes Biden has abdicated his duty to the American people.","FILE – A line of Texas Department of Safety vehicles line up on the Texas side of the Rio Grande with Mexico visible, right, near an encampment of migrants, many from Haiti, on Sept. 22, 2021, in Del Rio, Texas.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:35 AM PT – Monday, April 11, 2022White House National Security advisor Jake Sullivan seemed to poke the bear as the Biden administration wrestles with how to dissipate Russian forces from Ukraine. On several corporate news networks Sunday, Sullivan echoed Joe Biden’s claims that Russia’s attacks on civilians are “war crimes.”This came after reports drew attention to the missile attack on a crowded train station in the Ukrainian city of Bucha, which left at least 52 civilians dead. Sullivan further claimed these types of attacks were planed even before the invasion.The national security advisor also touched on Russia’s reshuffling of military leaders to administer the next phase of Russia’s invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly tapped a new general to lead the invasion, who has been linked to alleged bombings in Syria. Sullivan said this will lead to a scorched earth strategy that fits a pattern of Russian tactics and further pushed that Russia has already engaged in this type of warfare.Meanwhile, Sullivan stressed the Biden administration is still sending arms and other forms of aid to Ukraine. He said Biden’s strategy aims to bolster Ukrainian troops and regional allies to thwart attacks from Russia while allowing Ukraine to reclaim territory. Sullivan also admitted the Biden administration hopes the end of the war will end with a crippled Russia.WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT – Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy told the U.N.

Instead, Biden is expected to stay put in Washington, D.C. and make decisions solely from the White House. However, congressional lawmakers are taking matters into their own hands as a bipartisan delegation is expected to survey refugee assistance efforts at several NATO countries this week.","White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan speaks speaks at a press briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, April 4, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:29 AM PT – Monday, April 11, 2022Former Missouri governor and current Senate candidate Eric Greitens recently lambasted a prosecutor in Missouri who’s facing disciplinary action. On Saturday, Greitens aired his grievances with Kimberly Gardner on Breitbart News after he was forced to resign from the governorship after he was accused by Gardner of sexually assaulting and blackmailing a woman during his tenure as the governor of Missouri.On Thursday, a judge ordered prosecutor Kimberly Gardner to turn over all her communication records with Democrat mega donor George Soros between 2017 and 2019. The courts request to turn over these records comes after it was revealed that she received funds from the billionaire. Meanwhile, Greitens said she was was always walking on thin ice.“What happened was that eventually, they were caught,” he stated. “They were charged with seventy felonies for perjury and for evidence tampering, for building a false case against me. That corrupt former FBI agent just plead guilty and what happened just on Friday is that the Missouri Supreme Court told Kim Gardner, the Soros funded prosecutor that after delaying and delaying for four years that she must now turn over all her communications with George Soros.”Additionally, Gardner faces a disciplinary hearing due to multiple allegations which includes perjury and evidence tampering in relation to her probe into Greitens. Her hearing will determine if she will lose her law license and her job as a prosecutor.“We’re getting to the bottom of this,” said Greitens. “What’s even better is that on Monday, she faces disciplinary actions for over seventy instances of perjury in building a case against me. The bottom line for all your listeners is that truth prevails.”Meanwhile, the Senate candidate wrapped up his interview by calling out Senate Minority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for letting Kentanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination pass through the Senate. He also went on to accuse so-called RINOs of repeatedly stabbing the American people in the back for siding with and supporting Democrat policies.“Instead, we had Mitch McConnell letting her nomination sail through the United States Senate and we’ve seen that time after time,” he continued. “And the problem is not just with the left’s craziness. I mean they come with critical race theory, they come with defunding the police, they come with their open border policies, but the problem is that you have the RINOs who continually stab the American people in the back and side with and support the leftists.”It’s unknown if the previous allegations will affect Greitens’ chances in the state’s Republican primary which will take place in August.","FILE – In this Aug. 5, 2020, file photo, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner speaks during a news conference in St. Louis.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., listens during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 7, 2021. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:00 PM PT – Saturday, April 9, 2022Congress voted to strip Russia and its ally Belarus of “most favored nation” trade status. House lawmakers passed the measure in a 420-to-three vote Thursday with a bill banning Russian energy imports passing 413-to-nine, just hours after both were unanimously approved by the Senate. Revoking permanent normal trade relations status raises tariffs on imports from the Eastern European nations.The three members of Congress who opposed the first measure were all Republicans, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Fla.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). Greene took to Twitter to explain the logic behind her vote. First and foremost, the freshman representative asserted the bill give unnecessarily broad power to the executive branch to punish countries as it sees fit.“You see this bill that Congress just passed gives President Biden to be able to put sanctions on any country, not just Russia, but any country for what he deems to be human rights abuses and that can be any explanation, anything that he decides,” she stated. “It gives too much broad power to the President of the United States when our current president, Joe Biden, is not making good decision on behalf of America and we can’t trust his authority in this situation.”Greene also expressed her fears the measure would worsen already rampant inflation in the U.S. economy. Russia is a global exporter of agricultural products such as fertilizer and grain. The Georgia Republican claimed imposing more sanctions intended to dissuade further Russian aggression will only hurt the American people.Greene also outlined the reasons behind her vote against the ban on Russian oil imports. She explained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a finite resource and without a permanent substitute for Russian energy, prices are destined to shoot back up to record highs.The Democrats and the media are already attacking me for my NO votes today.

In an effort to help them deal with the pending surge, the Republican will be providing charter buses to send the illegals straight to Washington, D.C. The governor said this will allow Biden to more immediately address the needs of the people he is allowing into the country.Abbott outlined other new security measures, including enhanced inspection of cars and physical border barriers in addition to Texas building its own wall. He went on to say high smuggling areas will also now be flooded with lights during the night.As announced by @GovAbbott the Texas National Guard is conducting #OperationLoneStar Mass Migration Rehearsals to prepare for an influx of migrants due to #Title42 being rescinded.

This comes as a potential Nikolas Cruz sentencing juror was excused from the trial after saying she would be too busy to participate due to birthdays, her kids, her husband and “sugar daddy.”As the jury selection process began for Cruz’s trial earlier this week, a juror known as “Miss Bristol” told a Florida judge she may not be able to make it due to scheduling conflicts of hers and her son’s upcoming birthday’s. She then dropped the bombshell of the potential struggle she will face in juggling time between her husband and sugar daddy.Miss Bristol was reportedly not the only juror to be dismissed, but the judge was visibly confused by her excuse.

At least two people were shot and killed with several others wounded in an attack Thursday, where a suspected Arab gunman allegedly entered a pub and opened fire.“You can see right behind us restaurant, families and friends were sitting having supper and drinks and all of the sudden terrorist came over and shot them,” said Mirit Ben Mayor, spokeswoman for the Israeli Police.Hundreds of emergency personnel had arrived at the scene while police urged residents to stay indoors and away from the area. Additionally, police said the attack may have been politically motivated.

Authorities caught up to the man Friday after an hours-long manhunt through the city. The officers found the terrorist hiding near a mosque in Jaffa, a port city south of Tel Aviv, where they exchanged gunfire and the suspect was ultimately killed.This attack was the latest in a string of recent deadly assaults, but Israeli prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the country will not be shaken by panic or hysteria.“Every murderer should know that we will reach him and anybody who helps terrorists need to know that the price he will pay will be intolerably heavy,” Bennett warned. “I saw the father of the terrorist inciting for more violence, taking pride in his son, the murderer. We saw the celebrations and distribution of sweets in Gaza. These are the people we are facing and no, they are not individuals. They want to break our spirit and our hold here, on our land, but they won’t succeed. We will never break.”The shooter has been identified as a 28-year-old from Jenin, a city in the West Bank, who was in Israel illegally.","A woman reacts at the scene of a shooting attack In Tel Aviv, Israel, Thursday, April 7, 2022.

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:36  PM PT – Thursday, April 7, 2022More information is coming to light about the latest Biden family scandal. The President allegedly wrote a Brown University recommendation letter for the son of a Chinese oligarch, namely BHR executive Jonathan Li, back in 2017. This was revealed in Hunter Biden’s emails, which were obtained by Fox News on Wednesday.Republican lawmakers are demanding the White House release this recommendation letter. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said Joe Biden’s letter serves as “irrefutable proof” that he knew about Hunter’s business dealings with China and these emails are evidence that Joe used his political influence to profit from the communist country.At the time, Hunter Biden was a partner at BHR, which emails show reserved 10 percent of its profits for the “big guy.” Joe has repeatedly denied ever talking about business dealing with Hunter, though his press secretary appeared to fumble when questioned on the matter.Hunter Biden will be the end of Jen Psaki. https://t.co/g9KoHdum0V— Republican Party of Arizona (@AZGOP) April 7, 2022During a press briefing Wednesday, Jen Psaki was asked if it’s common practice for Joe to do favors for Hunter’s business partners. The White House official repeatedly noted that Joe was a “private citizen'” when and if he wrote that letter. She also disputed the evidence suggesting Joe knew of his family’s foreign business interests. .”Hunter is currently under federal investigation over his taxes and international business dealings. According to Fox News, the President’s son has been under federal investigation since 2018 with sources saying there is a high probability he committed a crime.In the meantime, all 19 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter asking 51 former Intelligence officials why they played a role in the narrative that stories about Hunter’s laptop were Russian propaganda. This came after 51 Intelligence officials in 2020 released a statement connecting Biden’s laptop with Russia.However, Republicans pointed out that the New York Times and the Washington Post have both recently independently confirmed the contents of the laptop were authentic. They said the most likely explanation for their denial is they were part of a coordinated effort to mislead Americans ahead of the 2020 elections in order to help get Joe Biden elected over Donald Trump.Either The NY Times printed fake news or Joe Biden is pressuring his Attorney General to prosecute Trump and others.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:51 AM PT – Wednesday, April 6, 2022According to Republican lawmakers, American energy is under attack. On Tuesday, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) led a press conference detailing how Joe Biden’s policies are hurting Americans’ wallets.Scalise alleged Biden has been at war with American energy companies since taking office and has crippled America’s ability to produce oil and gas. He pointed to recent reports claiming Biden is begging Canada for oil despite killing the Keystone Pipeline, which would have transported oil from that country.This came after Biden sought oil imports from authoritarian governments, including from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Additionally, the Louisiana Republican said Biden’s dubious energy policies don’t stop there.“It wasn’t just Keystone, Joe Biden hasn’t approved a single new pipeline in America since he’s been president,” stated Scalise. “And it’s not that he’s against all pipelines as my colleagues have pointed out. He approved Russia’s pipeline, the Nord Stream 2 which builds on top of the Nord Stream 1, which was already supplying oil to parts of Europe. We could have been there to provide all the oil and gas that Europe needs. And instead, Joe Biden turned off the spickets here sent leverage to Putin.”The lawmakers went on to describe who’s really suffering from Biden’s energy policies. House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) stressed American families are having a hard time maintaining their budgets as gas prices soar to record heights.“Gas prices under Biden’s failed leadership are the highest in U.S. history, costing the average American household an extra $2,000 per year,” she noted. “…Democrats historic energy failures are crushing families’ budgets in my district and across the country.”﻿In the meantime, Joe Biden has proposed several measures, including releasing gas from U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and threatening oil tax hikes on energy companies that he claims will curb the energy crisis. However, GOP critics believe these moves will only make the problem worse and put the burden of paying for these taxes on working class Americans.The Republican leaders have faith that Americans see what’s going as well as who’s at fault for the skyrocketing gas prices and take that knowledge to the polls in 2022. However, Rep. Stefanik predicts Democrats will try to shuffle the blame, once again, at Wednesday’s House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing with energy producers.","U.S. Rep.

On Tuesday, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis targeted New York City Mayor Eric Adams attempt to persuade Floridians to move to the Big Apple amid its recently passed Parental Rights in Education bill.During a press conference, Adams announced digital billboards will be displayed in major parts of Florida for eight-weeks, inviting people who are upset with Florida’s new law to move to New York City. The billboards feature rainbow colored slogans such as “New York City is alive and so is free speech.”This comes despite a recent incident where a mother was fired after she confronted Adams for keeping the city’s school mask mandate for toddlers in place.“We are loudly going to show our support and say to those in Florida, we want you here in New York,” stated Mayor Adams. “We want your right here in New York City and it’s more than just saying that. It’s also standing up and aligning ourselves with the men and woman of the LGBTQ plus community and stating that we are in unison with you and your right to have self-identification.”Meanwhile, DeSantis critiqued Adams move while describing it as “political grandstanding.” He also hit back at the mayor’s handling of COVID mandates for children.﻿In a statement, Florida’s press secretary said Adams billboards are doing the Sunshine State a favor. The official added, “if someone wants to leave Florida for a crime ridden socialist dystopia, the state will be better off without them.”According to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 300,000 residents fled from Democrat controlled New York in the past year, in turn, making it the nation’s leading state for population decline. However, DeSantis is confident nothing will change and he called out New York for “muzzling residents through the force of government.”","New York Mayor Eric Adams, at podium, addresses a news conference in the rotunda of City Hall, in New York, Monday, April 4, 2022.

While President Joe Biden has since called for increased gun control, the state with the most gun laws, 107 according to the State Firearm Laws Project at Boston University, is looking to add at least 24 more.Governor Gavin Newsom (D) directed lawmakers to craft a gun control bill in a similar fashion to the Texas heartbeat bill with the goal of encouraging private citizens to sue the gun industry.Yet another mass casualty shooting – leaving families with lost loved ones, people injured, and a community in grief. We are working closely with law enforcement to monitor the situation. We cannot continue to let gun violence be the new normal. https://t.co/W2GIPnQJwM— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) April 3, 2022“A private enforcement mechanism. If you think about it, admit it. It’s a private right of action. What does that mean? What it means is that an ordinary person of the community can bring a lawsuit and collect up to $10,000, plus attorney’s fees. If someone manufactures or transports any any weapon manufacturers distributes, transports in ports, somebody goes to out of state and brings in a bunch of weapons, they can bring in action $10,000 per now.” — State Sen. Bob Hertzberg, (D- Van Nuys, Calif.)Should any of these bills make it to the governor’s desk to be signed, they will likely face challenges in court. Meanwhile, law enforcement and the local community are holding the shooting suspects accountable for their actions.","California Gov.

His comments echoed remarks he made on the Senate floor last month when he said Ukraine needs action now.“The United States needs to implement our sanctions today, not yesterday. We don’t need to delay until June 24 with a waiver on energy payments from Russian banks. We still have so much more we could do, short of putting American boots on the ground.”﻿Marshall asserted that the U.S. needs to be a country of action and fulfill its role as the leader of the free world. This comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged western nations to toughen sanctions quickly in order to stop Russia from escalating its attacks on his country.","Sen.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:04 AM PT – Tuesday, April 5, 2022According to top GOP representatives, the Biden border crisis will soon expand through the whole nation. On Monday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) led a press conference lambasting the CDC’s decision to end border policy Title 42. Both the Trump and Biden administrations utilized the measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to turn away migrants who posed health concerns.McCarthy stressed Biden’s immigration policies have already welcomed a record number of illegal immigrants into America. He added, this has led to an exhaustion of America’s border resources and copious deaths of America’s youth due to the increased distribution of fentanyl.“There’s no longer a few border cities, every city in America is now a border city,” stated the California Republican. “Border agents told us about because of the overwhelming movement of people coming through and the cartels understanding, you’re getting 240 miles at a time that are unprotected.”McCarthy further lamented Republicans in both chambers of Congress have warned Biden about the devastating consequences of his policies. Additionally, he pointed out Republicans have been making trips to the border ever since the crisis first unfolded.Meanwhile, Texas Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) detailed how illegal immigration has negatively affected his state. Roy said Mexican cartels warring with each other are taking advantage of Biden’s policies to advance their narcotics and human smuggling operations. He also said cartels have also used their money and influence to employ American citizens for these activities.In the meantime, the representatives said they have introduced a proposal to block the CDC from killing Title 42, but noted no Democrats have joined their effort.Joe Biden’s Customs and Border Protection chief has reportedly admitted there will likely be an increase in illegal immigration when Title 42 expires on May 23. Other border officials have said the situation will be more dire while calling the next surge a “mass migration event.”","CIUDAD JUAREZ, MEXICO – Migrants cross the border between the U.S. and Mexico at the Rio Grande river, as they enter El Paso, Texas, on May 19, 2019 as taken from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

While speaking at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California on Monday, Barrett acknowledged justices have opinions about the results of their decisions.She added, however, that no judge is deciding a case to impose a policy result. She claimed every member of the court is trying to make their best effort to determine what the law as well as the U.S. Constitution requires. Barrett also encouraged dissenters of Supreme Court rulings to take a close look at the court’s justification.“But I think if you’re going to make the latter claim that the court got it wrong, you have to engage with the court’s reasoning first,” she explained. ” “And I think you should read the opinion and see, well does this read like something that was purely results driven and designed to impose the policy preferences of the majority? Or does this read like it actually is an honest effort, a persuasive effort, even if one you ultimately don’t agree with to determine what the Constitution and precedent requires as applied to a particular problem at hand.”Barrett also noted the idea of cameras in the courtroom to cover Supreme Court cases is a “uniquely tricky issue.”","U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett speaks with Board of Trustees Chairman Frederick J.

Ukrainian officials said more than 400 dead civilians have been found in towns in the Kiev region that Russian forces recently left.“You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal,” Biden stated. “Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha. This warrants him. He is a war criminal, but we have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight and we have to gather all the detail…what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it.”Russia’s claims it has no responsibility in the matter. In the meantime, Biden said he plans to slap additional sanctions on the country. This comes as a mass grave site was also discovered in Bucha. There is reportedly evidence that bodies were shot at close range.People stand next to a mass grave in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, April 4, 2022.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:40 AM PT – Monday, April 4, 2022Top Biden administration officials have continued to fan the flames of the crisis at the southern border. On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended the CDCs announcement last week that it would end the public health measure called Title 42 on May 23. The measure was employed by both the Trump and Biden administrations amid the COVID-19 pandemic to turn away migrants at the border due to health concerns.After pressure from progressive groups suing Biden over keeping the rule in place, it seems he has caved to their demands. When asked about the potential downsides to lifting the measure, Blinken pivoted and rambled about the Biden administration’s policy goals.“We’re focused on making sure that people throughout our hemisphere have opportunities at home going forward, so they’re not faced with this really hard choice of leaving everything behind and trying to come to the United States,” stated the official. “So building that kind of opportunity, building what one of my colleagues has called a ‘right to remain’ is our focus.”Additionally, DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas hid behind the different mission’s of the CDC and his agency by stressing it’s the CDC’s responsibility to enforce health measures while the DHS focuses on immigration issues. During an interview last week, Mayorkas tried to brush off the fact that border agents allegedly see around 7,000 migrants per day.According to reports, that number could jump to 18,000 encounters per day after Title 42 ends. The DHS chief went on to claim border agents are well equipped to handle the surge and the agency will actually enforce deportation proceedings.At least 600,000 illegal immigrants have escaped into the country since Biden took office.Now he wants to add fuel to that fire by repealing Title 42.— Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) April 3, 2022Meanwhile, Democrats are struggling to come together on how to promote the end of Title 42. Despite the Biden administration’s ardent defense of the move, several Democrat lawmakers, including Senators Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) decried the move.

Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) said he’s introduced a number of bills to bolster immigration courts and crackdown on criminal enterprises south of the border that he says will combat Biden’s open border policies. Gallagher is urging Congress to cancel its upcoming recess to pass measures that will secure the southern border.This comes as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials warn when Title 42 officially ends, there will be a mass migration event.","LA JOYA, TEXAS – JUNE 21: Medical personnel check in with immigrants after they crossed the Rio Grande into the U.S. on June 21, 2021 in La Joya, Texas.

In an interview on Sunday, he said Joe Biden has created millions of jobs and improved quality of life for millions of Americans.“Thanks to the success President Biden has had in vaccinating over 225 million Americans, boosting over 100 million Americans, America’s back to work,” stated the White House official.However, Republican lawmakers pointed out that shutting down and then reopening businesses is not the same as actually creating jobs. Meanwhile, the U.S. inflation rate accelerated to almost 8 percent in January and fuel costs have risen two-fold since Joe Biden took office.“Gas prices are a problem, absolutely,”Klain admitted. “That’s why the President took the actions he took this week to release a million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to tell the oil companies they either need to pump oil on the 9,000 permits they have or give them back for others to do that, to increase production here.

He then suggested the U.S. Treasury could make a profit on the SPR release.“So, the government can sell oil for above $100 and promise to buy that oil back in the range of $90,” Summers explained. “And then, a year from now, we’ll have the same sized Strategic Petroleum Reserve we had before. And we’ll have $10 a barrel times say 100 million barrels of oil, which is $1 billion.”I applaud the Biden Administration’s massive SPR release. It should be coupled w a forward purchase of oil to offset environmental issues and replenish the reserve.— Lawrence H.

McConnell calls Biden’s oil release a ‘drop in the bucket’Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters about President Joe Biden’s proposed $5.8 trillion budget, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 29, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:45 AM PT – Friday, April 1, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) finds Joe Biden’s gas price solution to be lacking. In a Thursday interview, the Kentuckian marveled at the White House’s pledge to dispense 1 million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.While the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates America burns through roughly 20 million barrels per day, McConnell spoke fondly of the days of the Trump administration when the U.S. was a net exporter of fossil fuels. At that point in time, he claimed America represented a preferable alternative to Russian oil.However, the minority leader lamented Biden has stripped the Western World of an ethical supplier in order to please the most radical fringe of his party. McConnell claimed gas prices are only one result of failed Big Government policies due to one-party rule. He alleged Biden and the Democrats attempt to solve every problem with exorbitant spending, which only exacerbates the situation.The worst inflation in 40 years is fleecing American consumers from the gas pump to the grocery store. Democrats’ policies have prices rising faster than wages. The American people know one month of war in Europe doesn't explain 12 months of rising inflation on Democrats' watch.— Leader McConnell (@LeaderMcConnell) March 31, 2022Although there have been some road blocks to the Democrat agenda, the Republican stated inflation has risen in direct correlation to bloated spending packages.“The best thing that happened last year was BBB (Build Back Better) going down, but they had already done the damage,” McConnell stated. “The so-called $2 trillion Rescue Plan is what produced 40-year high inflation, so they’ve done all the wrong things. They own this and it’ll take the Feds to squeeze it out, and I don’t know how long that’ll take.”The top Republican also expressed his surprise at a legislative push towards COVID spending when there are still funds that have yet to be dispensed. Moving forward, the minority leader does find a silver lining to the grim circumstances. Since Biden’s policies disproportionately affect the middle class, they may be more inclined to give the Republican Party a chance in November.“We know this is gonna be a midterm report card on the performance of the President and the President’s approval rating is what’s going to drive the fall election,” McConnell noted. “So the one thing I can safely say going into the 22′ election is we’re gonna have a really good environment.”","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters about President Joe Biden’s proposed $5.8 trillion budget, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 29, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:51 AM PT – Friday, April 1, 2022Several Republican campaigners take to the streets of Southern California to discuss rising gas prices and what Americans must do to bring costs back down.“We are out here because Californians are tired of high gas prices, and we figured the gas station is the best place to kind of post up and speak with voters and people that are just commuting all the time, driving all the time,” said Hallie Balch, a Republican campaigner. “Families, single income households, everybody’s dealing with this.”The demonstration took place at a Chevron in Garden Grove, Orange County this week with the half a dozen GOP advocates holding signs and getting honks of approval from passing cars. They said Democrats and their policies are solely to blame.“We have no control over the prices, so it’s not Russia and it’s only the Democrats that have done this with their policies,” Balch continued. “They talk about the green policy and why they don’t want to be drilling for oil. Well, guess what? All the other countries are doing it, so why can’t we?”This voter registration effort is just one of many taking place across the country in an effort to get more Americans to back Republicans at the ballot box.“Somebody registered to vote in L.A. County and they were saying that they are so fed up with the cost that they’ve been seeing that they actually switched from Democrat to Republican,” noted the campaigner. “And frankly, we didn’t know if that was going to be something that would actually happen, but it did. So we we’re just excited to get some people out.”These Republicans groups hope drawing attention to the displeasure many Americans are feeling with skyrocketing inflation and rising gas prices could help bolster support for the party ahead of the midterms.","FILE – A California street sign is shown next to the price board at a gas station in San Francisco, on March 7, 2022.

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:13 PM PT – Wednesday, March 30, 2022Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) submitted the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop hard drive and the receipt from the computer repair shop where it was dropped off into the congressional record.During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, the conservative firebrand cross examined FBI’s Cyber Division Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran. The FBI seized the laptop in December of 2019, however, Vorndran claimed he didn’t know where the laptop currently is. Gaetz pressed the issue and demanded answers.“How are Americans suppose to trust that you can protect us from the next Colonial Pipeline if it seems that you can’t locate a laptop that was given to you three years ago?” asked the Florida lawmaker. “So where is it, the laptop?”Further into the hearing, the Republican slammed the assistant director over how little he knew about how compromised the Biden family could potentially be. Vorndran said he was only there to answer questions about the bureau’s cyber program.“I would think that the President’s son who does international business referencing the now-President with the Chinese, with Ukrainians…I mean have you assessed whether or not the Hunter Biden laptop gives Russia the ability to harm our country?” Gaetz asked.The assistant director didn’t share who the committee could question about the laptops location or its content on Biden’s international business dealings. Although there was some resistance from Democrats on the committee, Gaetz was able to go on record with the evidence.“After consultation with majority staff, I seek unanimous consent to enter into the record of this committee content from files from and copies from the Hunter Biden laptop,” he stated.On top of this, congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) told One America News that he’s laying the groundwork for a probe into the media’s efforts to suppress the laptop story. If the GOP succeeds in taking control of the lower chamber after the midterms, the door to potentially subpoena Hunter Biden could open.","Rep.  Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) arrives for a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing with members of the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee on Capitol Hill on December 9, 2020 in Washington, DC.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:33 AM PT – Wednesday, March 30, 2022The Biden administration is grooming Singapore to be a top ally in the Indo-Pacific region. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to bolster bilateral relations.The two leaders discussed several security concerns in the region, including aggression from the Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea, North Korea’s increase in missile tests and ramifications of the 2020 military coup in Myanmar. Biden also noted the U.S. and Singapore are working together to ensure the region stays free, deepen economic ties and fight COVID-19 as part of a broad agenda they both share.“I’m really proud of the partnership between Singapore and the United States,” he stated. “It’s as close and as strong as it’s ever been. And together, we’re working to uphold a rules based order, international order, supporting the founding principles of the United Nations and advance a future for the Indo-Pacific that is both free and open.”Prime Minister Lee added, the U.S. and Singapore have blossomed their more than 80-year partnership into one with massive influence in shaping and stabilizing the region. He stressed threats from China and spillover from the Russian war with Ukraine have cemented the need for international unity and multilateral cooperation. Lee further warned, if the Ukraine crisis continues then Indo-Pacific countries could see devastating economic and political consequences.“There are potential flash points and contentious issues in our region too, which if not managed well could escalate to open conflict,” stated the official. “Countries with interests in the region need to pursue all efforts to settle disagreements through peaceful means, so that we can avoid reaching a point of no return.”Watch live as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore and I make a joint press statement. https://t.co/RSTR1xAB9q— President Biden (@POTUS) March 29, 2022Additionally, Vice President Kamala Harris met with Lee to discuss the modern concerns facing both the U.S. and Singapore. They touted several joint programs tackling how to bolster cybersecurity technology and others to explore the vastness of the universe.“Singapore has signed the Artemis Accords, which aim to promote the peaceful, sustainable and beneficial use of space,” Lee stated. “We are the first Southeast Asian country to sign on…so I’m very glad that the Vice President and I were able to meet again to discuss ways to take our partnership to even greater heights.”Last month, the Biden administration unveiled its strategy in bolstering ties between the U.S. and Indo-Pacific countries. The booklet vowed to strengthen the region’s military and economic infrastructure, so countries can maintain their sovereignty and loosen China’s grip on the region. Since then, top Biden diplomats and defense officials have traveled to several countries Indo-Pacific countries. The Pentagon even welcomed a delegation of Singapore defense officials recently.Additionally, Biden was originally set to host several leaders from participating ASEAN countries this week, but that meeting has been postponed. However, Biden maintains further entangling relations with East Asian and Indo-Pacific countries will secure America’s influence in the greater Asian continent for decades.","Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, with Vice President Kamala Harris, right, speaks at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex, in Washington, Tuesday, March 29, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:10 PM PT – Tuesday, March 29, 2022GOP lawmakers are decrying yet another massive spending proposal from the Biden administration. On the Senate floor Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned Joe Biden’s nearly $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2023 is just another far left wish list.McConnell stressed he called on the President to pivot his economic agenda toward the center to create policies that would benefit the average American. However, he claimed Biden has not listened to his advice and is looking to bolster Democrat-friendly federal agencies and punish American energy producers. Additionally, the Kentucky Republican lamented that Biden’s increase of the defense budget by only 4 percent will leave the U.S. military “treading water.”“They want to pour money into absurdities like the UN green climate fund, borrow from China to fund a global bureaucracy that will hand free money back to China,” he explained. “There’s plenty of money for things like anti-gun regulations, free lawyers for illegal immigrants and something called environmental justice. This whole far-left feast leaves out the reckless taxing and spending spree that Democrats failed to pass last year are are now trying to revive.”﻿Other GOP lawmakers further sounded the alarm on what Biden’s budget would do to the already dire economic and supply crises. Missouri Representative and Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, Jason Smith stressed Biden’s proposal would add $15 trillion to the national deficit. Smith went on to point out Americans are already suffering from a $3,500 inflation tax and Biden would add $8 million to the federal spending limit. He asserted this will only hurt American families and job creators.Additionally, several Republicans, including Arizona Representative Andy Biggs and Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, condemned Biden for not addressing pressing issues like border security and cracking down on fentanyl distribution in the U.S.“We don’t need a bureaucrat talking point or a bureaucrat wasting our time,” Tuberville stated. “We need a plan and we need a plan now to stop these drugs. Since President Biden has been in office, he has failed to take charge in every situation. Sadly, the drug overdose epidemic is no different.”Meanwhile, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul said the current inflation crisis is indicative of several Democrat economic strategies, including deficit spending and promising free programs to Americans while making retired and poor Americans front the bill. However, Paul remained optimistic that America’s financial institutions are strong enough to prevent hyperinflation and reverse the economy from heading to disaster.If not, economists have warned inflation will only get worse. They also warned that if the Federal Reserve doesn’t act quickly, the U.S. is likely headed for a recession.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., attends a news conference, Tuesday, Feb., 1, 2022, after a weekly Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, Pool)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:46 AM PT – Tuesday, March 29, 2022The U.S. State Department is revamping its calls to stomp Iran’s nuclear ambitions. On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with top diplomats from Israel, the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain and Morocco in Jerusalem to discuss the threat posed by Iran’s growing power.Experts pointed out, this meeting between Israel and several Gulf Arab States suggests monumental strides to achieve peace in the Middle East. Additionally, they stressed this builds off of President Donald Trump’s 2020 Abraham Accords, which aimed to normalize relations between Israel and the rest of the region.Despite this, Blinken argued the best way to combat Iran’s aggression and development of its nuclear program is to return to the controversial Obama-era nuclear deal.“An Iran with a nuclear weapon or the capacity to produce one on short notice would become even more aggressive and would believe it could act with a false sense of impunity,” asserted the Secretary of State. “The United States believes that a return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best way to put Iran’s nuclear program back in the box that it was in, but has escaped from since the United States withdrew from that agreement.”Since taking office, reviving the 2015 agreement had been a top priority for the Biden administration. However, this week the State Department lamented the deal is now in the hands of the Ayatollah regime after months of stalled talks and negotiating with Iran through third party diplomats.Biden had already made concessions to Iran by waiving sanctions on its civilian nuclear program and possibly taking the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps off of the U.S. terrorist list. The delisting of the IRGC has been a major criticism from regional partners, especially from the Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu. They warned the IRGC has been aiding terrorist activities in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.“Their proxy, the Houthis, just this weekend carried out a horrific attack on Saudi Arabia,” Bennett explained. “I hope the United States will hear the concerned voices from the region, Israel’s and others on this very important issue.”Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett gives a news conference with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after their meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office, Sunday, March 27, 2022, in Jerusalem. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, Pool)Meanwhile at a forum in Doha, Qatar, Special U.S. Envoy to Iran, Rob Malley stressed the nuclear deal does not cover the IRGC designation. Malley added, President Joe Biden has no intention of taking the group off the terror list.“I can tell you that the IRGC will remain sanctioned under U.S. law,” he stated. “And our perception and our views, our policy towards the IRGC, will not have changed.”In the meantime, Blinken vowed to continue to push for a nuclear deal with Iran while claiming it would hinder the rouge state’s nuclear ambitions. The Secretary of State added, he and Israeli diplomats will work together to combat Iran’s attacks in the region. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid accepted the continuance of a U.S.-Israel partnership, but reiterated his country does not support the deal with Iran.“Israel will do anything we believe is needed to stop the Iranian nuclear program, anything,” he stated. “From our point of view, the Iranian threat is not theoretical. The Iranians want to destroy Israel. They will not succeed; we will not let them.”The U.S. State Department has lamented it’s not clear if a deal with Iran will be reached anytime soon.","U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a news conference with Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita, at the Foreign Ministry in Rabat, Morocco, Tuesday, March 29, 2022.

The White House released the budget proposal on Monday while asserting it’s an attempt to ensure “fiscal responsibility, safety and security” at home and abroad.The 2023 budget would spend billions of dollars on security programs in Europe and Ukraine while also allocating $773 billion to the Pentagon. It would also increase taxes on wealthy Americans, which economists believe will further discourage investment and hinder economic growth.“This is un-American, this idea,” stated Venture investor Kevin O’Leary. “It’s fundamentally against 60 percent of the economy where the companies I fund, the men and woman who create family businesses are vehemently opposed to this regardless of what side of the aisle they’re on.”Biden absurdly claims his administration has ""reduced inflationary pressures.""Biden's historic inflation crisis has been going on for nearly a year. pic.twitter.com/wXkqiBKhql— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 28, 2022“It’s un-American that’s what it is,” O’Leary continued. “And I can predict this, not that I want to get into politics, Biden is going to get decimated in the midterms.”Biden’s new budget would also allocate $26 billion to NASA, which is an 11 percent increase from fiscal year 2022.

He noted, he’s lucky to have his grassroots donors who don’t ask him to vote in a certain way just because they contribute to his campaign.“I am very fortunate in my position to where I get, you know, probably $5 from 500,000 people a year versus most people who have to rely on that $70,000 check from one individual person.”While the most picked up soundbite has been one in which he accused fellow lawmakers of engaging in unsavory activities that contradict the image they project to the American people, Cawthorn touched on many shortcomings within the federal government.“Then there’s the kind of the whole espionage aspect that goes on in Washington,” he stated. “You know, so many people trade in secrets and there’s a currency in secrets. It’s wild.”The North Carolina lawmaker said he’s labeled an “extremist” for wanting to return to an America with conservative values.“I don’t want the government to be involved in your life,” he explained. “I think they federal government should make sure we never lose a war, we have good roads and we have dominate trade deals. Aside from that, keep your hands off my life.”Cawthorn went on to say it’s time for conservatives to set the narrative and go on the offensive, while blaming Democrats and so-called Republicans In Name Only for many of the problems facing Americans today.Just HOW Corrupt is D.C?

(Photo released by Panama City Police via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:06 AM PT – Tuesday, March 29, 2022Florida law enforcement have seized an astounding number of guns from Spring breakers. On Monday, Panama City officials announced it has confiscated 75 guns and arrested over 161 people over a two-day period. Panama City Beach Police Chief, J.R. Talamantez said the events that have taken place are unacceptable and pathetic.“There were weapons brought to a resort destination,” he noted. “These were weapons brought to a beach by cowards who hide behind these guns, by cowards that cried when they were approached by true heroes wearing a badge. These individuals will soon find out what justice looks like.”Authorities said guns on the streets are still a concern, adding they “will not tolerate this in their community.” One of the incidents included a police officer being hit over the head with a beer bottle. Chief Talamantez said the people are blatantly disregarding public safety and are in the beach town for the sheer reason of causing disruption.Meanwhile, employees at a local Walmart ducked for cover when a mob of people ravaged the aisles destroying merchandise. City officials said the hecklers were taking part in an event called “Panamaniac,” which was orchestrated by social media influencers.Revelers ransacked a Walmart in Panama City Beach, Fla. over the weekend. Police had to close a two-mile stretch of Front Beach Road because of the out of control crowds.

But what we are is a real fun beach. Panama City is a family destination and that’s not going to change…trust me when I tell you, this is just a bad element of people.”In further steps, a special meeting is scheduled for later this week to discuss the need for additional measures.",Police in Panama City Beach said 75 guns were seized and 161 people were arrested during a chaotic weekend.

(Photo by GREGG NEWTON/AFP via Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:34 AM PT – Tuesday, March 29, 2022NASA Administrator Bill Nelson discussed future space missions at the organization’s annual address. His comments came after the Biden administration granted their request for an increased budget to continue with their operations.“We’re having this discussion today because President Biden and his administration released this budget request…NASA’s $26 billion fiscal year budget for ’23,” Nelson stated. “It’s a request from the President, from us and it is a significant increase over last year’s budget.”.@POTUS' $26B budget for @NASA is a signal of support for our missions in a new era of exploration. It’s an investment in small businesses and universities. It's supporting research to fight climate change. And it's confidence in the NASA workforce. https://t.co/xl7pRDjzBT— Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) March 28, 2022The NASA administrator also took the time to provide several updates about the James Webb Telescope. According to Nelson, the first batch of images of a new galaxy captured by the telescope will be released to the public in the Summer.“This summer, we’re going to see the first images I’ve seen and you all have as well, the first Target store,” he stated. “And what we’re going to see in the images that are coming is revealing the stars and the galaxies. That happened to form the first Galaxy 13 and a half billion years ago. Just after the beginning. Think about that.”Nelson then went on to address their plans to have astronauts return to the surface of the Moon and the establishment of a lunar space station.“Just last week we announced a plan for more competition to add additional landers to carry astronauts to the lunar surface,” he continued. “We expect to land about once a year for more than a decade. We’re going to put an outpost or something like a station in lunar orbit. It’s going to be in a polar orbit of the Moon and we’re going to call it Gateway. It will provide essential support for our return to the lunar surface, but it will also serve as a staging point for deep space exploration.”Nelson ended the address with an announcement of a plan to have an astronaut touchdown on the surface of Mars.","Painters refurbish the NASA logo on the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in Florida on May 29, 2020.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:31 AM PT – Monday, March 28, 2022The White House raced to clarify President Joe Biden’s apparent calls for a “regime change” in Russia after facing massive backlash sparked by his ad-libbed statements in Poland.According to reports citing White House officials Sunday, Biden’s statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin were not part of his speech as prepared and were not screened on the teleprompter either.""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.""Did Joe Biden just endorse regime change in Russia? pic.twitter.com/QNLG8OZ3Oz— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 26, 2022The White House attempted back-pedal the presidents remarks, affirming his point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. Several officials, both in the U.S. and abroad, are denouncing Biden’s unplanned statements.“I wish he would stay on script,” said Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho). “Whoever wrote that speech did a good job for him, but my gosh, I wish they would keep him on script…it’s gonna cause a huge problem. “Additionally, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also shed light on Biden’s speech Sunday. He reinforced what the President meant is Putin cannot be empowered to wage war and said the U.S. does not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else.“In this case, as in any case, it is up to the people of the country in question,” Blinken stated. “It is up to the Russian people, but what we do have is a strategy to strongly support Ukraine. We’ve been doing that and rallying partners and allies around the world to do that.”French President Emmanuel Macron also criticized Biden, saying his remarks could cause unnecessary escalation in tensions with Russia. Meanwhile, Moscow has since responded to Biden’s statement, saying it’s up to the people of Russia to decide who remains in power in their country.Biden was forced to clarify his statement about removing Putin from power. While leaving a church in Washington, D.C. on Sunday, a group of reporters called out asking if Biden was, in fact, calling for regime change.Biden says “no” he wasn’t calling for regime change, which is a total lie.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:31 AM PT – Friday, March 25, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said America must invest in a future of strong leadership against threats abroad. The top Republican recently discussed military production, defense funding and American leadership as the Russia-Ukraine crisis intensifies.While speaking on the Senate floor Thursday, McConnell said he believes Ukrainian forces can win against Russia without American boots on the ground. However, he claimed President Joe Biden must send Ukraine more weapons and ammunition.“Ukrainian forces can win this fight,” asserted the senator. “Let me say that again, Ukrainian forces can win this fight, but they need more weapons, more ammunition, more fuel, and they need it all as fast as possible.”McConnell also noted, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attacks against Ukraine has discredited politicians who called for pulling America away from the world stage. He warned every day that Biden fails to demonstrate clear American leadership, the nation’s adversaries overseas are growing more empowered. As a notable example, he mentioned China.“There’s nothing remotely prudent or sensible about handing over entire regions of the world to these thugs,” he stated. “The natural security interests of the United States never stop at our own borders and they certainly do not today.”McConnell said the Biden administration must invest in a self-reliant future by increasing domestic energy production and defense spending.“We will see if the President finally commits to investing in a future of strong American leadership,” noted the Senate Minority Leader. “Our global challenges are not partisan issues, they’re American issues. I sincerely hope that the Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces submits a defense budget request that reflects this reality.”Looking ahead, the Biden administration is set to send their budget request for the next fiscal year on Monday.﻿","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., does a tv news interview following a national security briefing on Ukraine, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 16, 2022.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:57 AM PT – Friday, March 25, 2022President Joe Biden recently discussed the initiative between the EU and United States to decrease European dependence on Russian energy.While speaking from Brussels ahead of his trip to Poland Friday morning, Biden alleged Russia has used its energy resources to coerce as well well as manipulate its neighbors and used the profits to drive President Vladimir Putin’s war machine. He said this is why he cut U.S. ties with Russian oil and gas earlier in the month, saying the U.S. could when others could not because it’s a net exporter of energy with strong domestic industry.Biden added, eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe, but it’s the right thing to do from a moral standpoint. He went on to suggest the crisis in Europe is an opportunity to push green energy policies. This all while Republicans have been urging the administration to bring energy independence back to the United States.“These steps will increase energy security, economic security and national security,” Biden stated. “And we’re going to set up a joint task force to implement these changes and drive progress that will be co-chaired by representatives from the White House and the President of the European Union’s team.”Biden also said he believes Russia should be removed from the G20 group. He said if other member nations didn’t agree to removing Russia, Ukraine should at least be allowed to attend the meetings. Biden then urged other countries to stay “fully and totally united” against Russia.Meanwhile, experts at the Ron Paul Institute found statements from the NATO summit in violation of NATO’s formal objectives. According to the institute’s executive director, Daniel McAdams, NATO charter says it will pursue peaceful and non-violent means to resolve disputes in third-party countries. However, he pointed out that NATO providing weapons, intelligence and military training to Ukrainian government are not peaceful actions.Why Is NATO Violating Its Own Charter & Doing The Opposite of What It Was Founded To Do?Watch the whole show here: https://t.co/sssxFcfyUB pic.twitter.com/ap4LLWEtIJ— Ron Paul (@RonPaul) March 24, 2022Dr. Ron Paul said NATO’s rhetoric fuels further escalation in tensions with Russia.

Lieb File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:47 AM PT – Friday, March 25, 2022A trial for a former FBI agent came to a screeching halt before it began. Jury selection was set to begin Thursday, but 69-year-old William Tisaby decided to plead guilty at the last minute.Tisaby admitted in his plea Wednesday to misdemeanor evidence tampering related to the 2018 case on then-Missouri Governor Eric Greitens who had been accused of sexual assault and blackmail, which led him to resign from office.Prior to the trial, Tisaby faced six -counts of perjury and one-count of evidence tampering for his conduct in the investigation.Tisaby was said to have falsely testified in a deposition regarding certain documents involved in the case, however, his attorney said he wasn’t trying to mislead anyone.“I think it was just more of an issue of just negligence in this matter,” said Jermaine Wooten, Tisaby’s attorney. “It was a slew of documents that he had and he just went into that deposition really just not prepared. And that’s what it was, there was no malice in this man’s heart.”His attorney also stated health concerns as the reason for the now-guilty plea.“We met with Mr. Tisaby along with his wife and they just felt because of his health decline and along with her health situation, it was in their best interest to enter a plea of guilty,” Wooten explained.However, special prosecutor for the case, Robert Russell, said Tisaby was trying to hide information.“The statements that were going on in the deposition were to try to conceal and suppress those particular documents that he didn’t want to talk about,” he explained. “And we had him plead guilty to that information, he did so by testifying that they didn’t exist when in fact they did.”Meanwhile, instead of facing prison time, Tisaby will now serve one year of probation and must pay court costs. The trouble for Greitens doesn’t seem to be over though as his ex-wife has accused him of physical abuse.","FILE – Former Missouri Gov.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:27 PM PT – Thursday, March 24, 2022President Joe Biden highlighted the latest sanctions against Russia and efforts to help Ukraine after meeting with fellow NATO leaders in Belgium. During a press conference in Brussels Thursday, Biden said the sanctions are targeting hundreds of Russian lawmakers, oligarchs and defense companies that “fuel the nation’s war machine.”Tune in as I hold a press conference about my meetings in Europe with Allies and partners on our response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. https://t.co/KSakZNhnET— President Biden (@POTUS) March 24, 2022He confirmed plans to commit more than $1 billion in humanitarian aid to help Ukrainians affected by the war as well as plans to allow up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees into the U.S. Biden also noted NATO is fortifying the alliance’s eastern flank in a move which could lead to more U.S. troops in Europe.Today, I announced that the United States will welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and others fleeing Russia’s aggression.We’re focused on reuniting families and providing refuge to those in harm’s way.— President Biden (@POTUS) March 24, 2022Biden notably said sanctions were never meant to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine, but suggested the long-term impact of such measures will prompt him to end the war.Separately, House GOP Conference chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) asserted that Putin is “committing genocide” in his ongoing assault on Ukraine. She made the comment while speaking to reporters Thursday at the House GOP annual retreat and also called Putin an authoritarian and war criminal.Stefanik also told reporters House Republicans have been consistent in their opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Republican’s condemnation of Putin comes as U.S. and European allies have strongly denounced Russia over suspected war crimes in Ukraine.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared Russian forces have committed war crimes during their invasion. In a statement on Wednesday, he highlighted the countless accounts and images of suffering and destruction.According to Blinken, nearly 5,000 Ukrainians have died as a result of Russia’s attacks. Secretary Blinken described Russia’s assaults as unjust and unprovoked. He noted, his declaration is based on the Biden administration’s ongoing review of information from public and intelligence sources.","President Joe Biden arrives for a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels, Thursday, March 24, 2022.

He added, the war-propaganda machine in the media is also financially benefiting from the situation.“There’s still delight in Washington, the military-industrial complex celebrate because business is good,” he stated. “Blow up the weapons, build more, test more, new technology, on and on. But someday, they’ll run out of money and then they’ll have to change their tune.”Dr. Paul stressed that tensions with Russia do not benefit America’s national interests or the American people.“They’ll end with hundreds of billions and they never come up short because if you come up short and you don’t vote for it, they are going to say you’re unpatriotic,” explained the former Texas representative. “Patriotism means obedience to the military-industrial complex and then you never get canceled.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:40 AM PT – Thursday, March 24, 2022A group of unidentified smash-and-grab thieves robbed a jewelry store in broad daylight and made off with millions of dollars worth of jewelry. Police were called to investigate the incident at Luxury Jewels of Beverly Hills on Tuesday afternoon after at least five armed individuals broke through the front window with a sledgehammer and proceeded to rob the place.“I was sitting in my office and I heard what I thought was gunshots,” recounted store owner Peter Sedghi. “Really loud, literally sounded like gunshots. So I told my staff, I yelled out, ‘everyone on the floor!’ I got on the floor, pushed the panic button. I waited until what I thought were gunshots stopped. I grabbed my gun and I came running out.”The group reportedly arrived in a stolen vehicle wearing hooded sweatshirts and surgical-style masks. They stole an estimated $3 million to $5 million worth of merchandise. The suspects then fled the scene in a different vehicle, which was later determined to be a white Audi sedan.“The suspects fled on foot, however, they left the vehicle that they traveled to the location behind,” stated Lt. Giovanni Trejo, Beverly Hills Police Department. “That vehicle was reported stolen out of a location in the city of Long Beach. We, at this point, detectives are following up on all the leads. We believe that there was another vehicle that was used. The only preliminary information on that vehicle we have on that vehicle that I have right now is that it was a white Audi.”although the suspects remain at large, a neighboring store owner was able to trip one of the burglars and recover several stolen watches. Luckily no injuries were reported, but several within the community are now worried about the safety of businesses.“I was sitting at my desk and I heard a loud bang, so I thought it was a gunshot, but then I look up and I see the guys with sledgehammers breaking the window,” explained Luxury Jewels employee Cindy Delaguerra. “I got down. I was pressing the alarm button and Peter, I just told him to shoot them. I go, just get your gun and shoot them. I said shoot them. And by the time he came out, they were just gone.”Meanwhile, police say robberies in the Los Angeles area alone have increased by 18 percent over this past year.","Pedestrians walk past a boarded up Luxury Jewels of Beverly Hills on Wednesday, March 23, 2022 in Beverly Hills, Calif.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, Pool)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:38 PM PT – Wednesday, March 23, 2022The State Department is lowering its expectations of returning to the controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. It’s just over a year into the Joe Biden presidency and his administration is already backing away from its top foreign policy goal.While speaking with reporters on Tuesday, U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price lamented “the jury’s still out” regarding the return to the Obama-era Iran Nuclear Deal.Biden diplomats have reportedly exhausted months of third party negotiations to resurrect the agreement and even offered to lift Trump-imposed sanctions on the Ayatollah regime as well as lift the terrorist designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.Earlier this month, Biden’s national security apparatus and international partners espoused optimism for a return to the deal. However, talks stalled in response to U.S sanctions imposed on Russia who reportedly has a heavy influence in negotiations with Russian diplomats threatening to derail the talks all together.Price claims Russia has since simmered down their threats and all parties are continuing to hash out differences. However, Price said it’s not up to the Biden administration to force a deal.“We know that there has to be a great deal of urgency and we know that now the onus is on Tehran to make decisions regarding its willingness to enter into, once again, a mutual return to compliance or not,” he stated.Price went on to claim Biden’s diplomats have always planned for a world where there was no deal with Iran. He also praised the efforts of the Trump administration to foster peace in the Middle East while citing the historic Abraham Accords.This came after leaders of Israel, the UAE and Egypt all met to bolster trilateral relations and strategize how to combat Iran’s influence in the region. Many Arab state governments condemned the original Obama-era deal, arguing it gave the Ayatollah a slap on the wrist concerning its support for terrorist activities carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.Price commended the new trilateral partnership, stressing their goals align with America’s. In the meantime, the official said the State Department, along with Special Envoy to Iran Rob Malley, will continue to monitor negotiations. However, he now suggested a deal is neither imminent nor certain.﻿","State Department spokesman Ned Price speaks during a news conference at the State Department, Thursday, March 10, 2022, in Washington.

Meanwhile, Jackson’s role at the elite day school was just one part of Cruz’s focus on critical race theory.The senator questioned Jackson’s stance on the New York Times’s controversial 1619 Project, which recast the nation’s founding as the year when enslaved Africans first arrived in the colonies. She responded by saying she has never studied critical race theory nor has it ever come up in her work.However, Cruz recited a 2015 speech made by Jackson, where she explicitly talks about the theory as a judge. Furthermore, several GOP members contested Jackson’s board position with Sen. Blackburn saying “it raises red flags.”Two years ago, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson gave a speech at the University of Michigan Law School where she referenced the work of “acclaimed investigative journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.”The 1619 Project is complete revisionist history and it is propaganda. pic.twitter.com/DspPNyV14C— Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) March 22, 2022A simple majority is needed for her confirmation in an evenly divided Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaker.

South Africa submitted their own resolution to the conflict, which was met with heavy criticism due to its similarities with a resolution proposed by Russia. Despite this, South Africa remains steadfast that their version has no relation to its Russian predecessor.“The South Africans have tabled a text which does call for a cease fire, but at the moment doesn’t attribute any responsibility for the causes of the humanitarian crisis,” stated U.K. Ambassador, Barbara Wood. “Now I know that OCHA and humanitarian organizations around the world are doing all they can to resolve it, but there’s no point in the UN perpetrating this without being clear, I think, about the cause of the humanitarian crisis. So we’re all discussing now with the South Africans, you know, how we can come to a text that would command widespread support across the General Assembly without having to have two votes on texts, essentially, which want the same thing.”Among those critical of the resolutions put forth by Russia and South Africa is U.S. Ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Her main criticism of South African proposal is the lack of any mention of holding Russia accountable for their actions in Ukraine.“Russia is the cause of the humanitarian crisis,” stated Thomas-Greenfield. “The other two resolutions, one put forth by Russia and the other put forth by South Africa, does not identify the cause of the crisis. And again, it would be, as I’ve said before, like the arsonists calling for the neighbors to help him put out the fire that he started in one neighbor’s house. Russia is the aggressor here and it is absolutely unconscionable for Russia to think that they can put forward a humanitarian resolution.”Russia’s First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky is pictured. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy accused western nations of being hypocritical if they refuse to support their draft when the General Assembly moves to vote on a resolution.“Well, I think that if Western nations do not support our draft, this is just a reflection of the hypocrisy because one thing is to speak about these things and the other thing is to make a decision,” he asserted. “Everybody understands that in order to help humanitarian agencies, the Security Council has to say its position and to give them some instructions. That’s what we are proposing to do, without any politicization as any other humanitarian resolution adopted ever by the Security Council. And that’s why we don’t understand why people would be saying one thing and acting in absolutely another way.”A vote on which resolution will be adopted by the organization is set for this week.","Russia’s First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky is pictured.

He was identified as a 34-year-old Arab man from a nearby settlement.Authorities said the assailant had a criminal record and had spent four-years in prison for attempting to join the Islamic State back in 2015. This is the deadliest attack in Israel in several years.“Five casualties were brought here, three of them were in critical condition and after resuscitation efforts by multiple teams we unfortunately had to determine their deaths,” stated Dr. Dan Schwartzfox, Deputy Director of Soroka Medical Center. “Two other victims in their 40s arrived in critical but stable condition.” This terrorist just stabbed two innocent people to death and wounded others in Beersheba, Israel. Thankfully a passer-by neutralized him before he could inflict more carnage.

The leaders discussed ways to further prop up the Ukrainian government as it struggles to accept Russia’s peace offers.“They discussed their serious concerns about Russia’s brutal tactics in Ukraine, including its attacks on civilians,” Psaki explained. “They underscored their continued support for Ukraine, including by providing security assistance to the brave Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russian aggression and humanitarian assistance to the millions of Ukrainians who have fled the violence. They also reviewed recent diplomatic efforts in support of Ukraine’s effort to reach a cease fire.”The White House Press Secretary noted that talks with EU leaders will continue.“It may have been last week they talked about doing this on a regular basis,” she continued. “Not necessarily because there is a big deliverable out of it, but just to keep an open line of communication.”Biden is planning to travel to Europe later this week to discuss the economic and security fallout of his foreign policies.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks in the South Court Auditorium on the White House campus, March 18, 2022, in Washington.

On Monday, the first Spring storm brought more than just showers as entire towns faced the prospect of being flattened by the heavy winds.The city of Jacksboro was in the direct line of the storms as they moved east across the Lone Star State. Witnesses taking shelter at the local school said they could hear the walls shaking, but didn’t think the damage would be as severe as it ended up being.“Substantial damage to our elementary and high school, both of the gym at the elementary, the roof was taken off. Walls collapsed. You can see the damage here at our high school gymnasium.— Brad Burnett, Superintendent Jacksboro School DistrictMore than 65,000 people reportedly lost power overnight as a result of the storms with one county being forced to shut down its grid after numerous lines went down.Texas Governor Greg Abbott visited the site of the damage in Williamson County, declaring it to be a miracle that no deaths had been reported as a result of the storms.“At the very same time, and what I’m about to say may be early and premature, but it may be a miracle also,” he stated. “Because even though there’s been some devastating physical damage, to my knowledge as of right now, there is no report of loss of life, which is just stunning.”Thank you to all who worked through the long day and night to keep us weather aware and safe, including the national weather services, local weather broadcasters, emergency managers, city and county officials, and first responders in communities across the state. #txwx pic.twitter.com/bcm9bnBIwJ— Gov.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:00 AM PT – Monday, March 21, 2022Rising gas prices are fueling thieves to take extreme measures. The stealing of gas is also on the rise across a number of states as more Americans are struggling to afford fuel.According to reports, the number of gas thefts skyrocketed in California, Illinois, Texas and at least seven other states. An expert from AAA cautioned people to be on the lookout while at the pump.“This is a sign of the times, you know, it’s thieves looking for ways they can make money by stealing what is becoming an increasingly more expensive and valuable commodity — gasoline,” said Doug Shupe, AAA employee.Thieves are also getting creative when it comes to stealing fuel with some going as far as drilling holes into the tanks of vehicles, which can cost up to $1000 to repair.Multiple reports say gas thieves are even stealing fuel from under ground tanks at gas stations through a trap door inside their trucks. A Los Angeles gas station manager, Jerry Thayil, said 360 gallons of fuel was stolen in just three days.“The van drives on top of the fuel tank and then that’s all you see,” Thayil explained. “No one comes out, so they have a trap door inside their vehicle, which is crazy.”AAA recommends people park their cars under bright lights or inside a parking garage to discourage thieves from targeting them. The organization also advises looking out for tell tale signs such as a check engine light, the smell of fuel inside the vehicle or a puddle on the side of the tank.Kevin McCarthy has been damn near clairvoyant on the issue of gas prices and inflation during the Biden presidency.If we win BIG in the midterms, he deserves a lot of credit for signposting these issues. https://t.co/YlgdOVUEB1— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) March 18, 2022In the meantime, customers at gas stations around the country are becoming frustrated as they see the number at the pump rising every week. Overall, average U.S. gas price rose to $4.31 last week, which is more than a 60 percent surge from a year ago.TOPICS:AAAautoCaliforniaDoug ShupeECONOMYfuelgasGas Pricesgas stationsIllinoisinflationJerry ThayilLos Angeles gasnewsOANOANNOILpoliticsRussiaTexastransportationUkraineWar TWEETPIN ","FILE – A California street sign is shown next to the price board at a gas station in San Francisco, on March 7, 2022.

In a 424-to-eight vote on Thursday, House lawmakers voted in support of removing permanent normal trade relations status with Russia and Belarus to inflict economic pain on Russia.“Russia’s cruel and unprovoked invasion has already forced nearly 3 million Ukrainians to flee their homes, creating what the United Nations has called the greatest, the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since WWII, ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) .”Because (Vladimir) Putin shows no sign of ceasing his horrible aggression, the Congress today will take another step in, lockstep with many of our allies as is the Biden administration, to tighten our stranglehold on the Russian economy.”This morning, Members of the House and Senate had the distinct privilege of receiving a virtual address by President @ZelenskyyUa.

Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.), the only Ukrainian-born member of Congress, made an emotional appeal.“They cannot just go kill a bunch of people, destroy cities, kill women and children, and then go back and have business as usual,” she asserted. “Congress is sending a very strong message. If they want to have peace, it better be soon. And they better get to the table and stop this insanity, and killing of the Ukrainian people.”She further added, it’s also vital that close Russian ally Belarus is included in the act and must also suffer the consequences.“People of Belarus need to understand that their leader is part of what is happening and this genocide in Ukraine,” Spartz continued. “And we cannot create a loophole where Putin is going to use Belarus to funnel monies through them.”Ukraine is the second colossal failure of judgement from current Pentagon, but this time with even higher cost.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:49 AM PT – Friday, March 18, 2022A disgraced former politician isn’t ruling out a come back. Andrew Cuomo may consider running for New York governor again. He hinted at a potential this week while speaking at a New York Hispanic Clergy Organization event in the Bronx.The former governor resigned in disgrace amid sexual harassment allegations last year, which he still denies. Instead, Cuomo blamed “cancel culture” for leading to his resignation while also accusing political members from his own party of wanting him out of the way.“…Cancel the cancel culture, that’s not who we are,” stated the former official. “We’re Americans. Our cancel culture mentality today is a modern day stonings. Remember, the stonings in the Bible?”The elder Cuomo went on to directly address the eleven sexual harassment charges against him. The governor who once called it despicable to question survivors had no problem casting doubt on his accusers.“How can you have a report that said 11 cases?” he asked. “And then it goes to qualified law enforcement and they find no cases. It was a fraud. Eleven to zero. It was a fraud. They wanted me out.”Despite the allegations, Cuomo said the curtain has yet to close on his public life. In a hypothetical gubernatorial match up, Cuomo only trailed incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul by four points. If the Democrat wanted to make a potential bid he would need to do it quickly as petitions for state wide office are due in April.","Former New York Gov.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:40 AM PT – Friday, March 18, 2022White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki discussed an upcoming phone call with Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. She said Biden is planning to ask Xi whether he will continue supporting good relations with Russia.On Thursday, Psaki told reporters the Biden administration is concerned about warming ties between Russia and China. Earlier this week, U.S. and Chinese diplomats held a seven-hour meeting in Rome, Italy after which China reasserted its commitment to a “rock solid” friendship with Russia.“As we have made clear, our deep concerns about China’s alignment with Russia and the potential implications and consequences of that,” Psaki stated. “So, the President will also share his assessment of that during the call, but I don’t have another an update for you on any internal assessment that is just how we are approaching or he is approaching the call tomorrow.”The secretary further expressed concerns that China’s support for the Kremlin regime could be a pretext for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces to attack Ukraine with chemical or biological weapons, even though they deny such claims. Psaki reiterated if the two countries collectively threaten Ukraine, actions would be taken.“It is a high concern, a significant concern given our Secretary of State just conveyed that and certainly our concerns about China assisting in any way Russia as they invade a foreign country is of significant concern,” she noted. “And would the response to that would be consequences.”Asked what Biden plans to tell the Chinese if they continue to back Russia, Psaki says ""it's up to the Chinese to decide where they want to…be as the history books are written."" pic.twitter.com/DlmR0IhkJw— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 17, 2022Meanwhile, Biden is set to speak with President Xi on Friday.","White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Thursday, March 17, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/John Locher)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:08 AM PT – Thursday, March 17, 2022At least nine people were killed following a fatal head-on collision between a pick-up truck and van in Texas. Six college students from the University of the Southwest, their head golf coach and a 13-year-old were among those killed in the crash Tuesday.Meanwhile, two students remain in critical condition at local hospitals. According to Texas Department of Public Safety officials, the university’s men’s and women’s golf team was heading back to New Mexico after their tournament in Midland.“This was a head on crash, one of the vehicles involved belonged to the University of the Southwest,” announced Sgt. Steven Blanco of the Texas Department of Public Safety. “It was transporting the men’s and women’s golf team from a golf tournament here in the West Texas area. Tragically, there are deceased in that vehicle.”According to authorities,a Dodge pick up truck drove into the northbound lane Tuesday night, in turn, striking the van the team was traveling in head-on. Both vehicles burst into flames following the collision.The driver of the pick up truck and a 13-year-old passenger were pronounced dead. The coach killed in the crash was identified as 26-year-old Tyler James who was reportedly in his first year in charge of the men’s and women’s teams.“From the first time I met Tyler you could tell his goal in life and his dream job was to be a golf coach,” said Ryan Erwin, VP of Student Engagement at East Texas Baptist University. “And he took his role very seriously, even though he was still a graduate student. He served as a very dependable assistant coach. He loved mentoring, investing in the lives of the golfers.”In the meantime, the National Transportation Safety Board is sending a 12 member team to investigate the incident and officials say the probe could take around 18-24 months.","Golfers finish a round near a makeshift memorial at the Rockwind Community Links Wednesday, March 16, 2022, in Hobbs, New Mexico.

A judge sentenced Jussie Smollett to 150 days in jail Thursday, March 10, 2022, branding the Black and gay actor a charlatan for staging a hate crime against himself while the nation struggled with wrenching issues of racial injustice. (Cook County Sheriff’s Office via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:08 AM PT – Thursday, March 17, 2022Disgraced actor Jussie Wmollett was released from an Illinois jail after lawyers claimed he was in physical danger. On Wednesday, the Empire star left the Cook County Jail after serving just six days and posting a $150,000 bond.A panel of three appellate judges ordered the release of Smollett on bond, but only while his lawyers appeal his conviction. The decision came after Smollett’s lawyers demanded his release while claiming inmates were yelling homophobic and racist slurs at the actor.Smollett lawyer Nenye Uche alleged his client had already been fined for his charges and was being unconstitutionally punished twice.“His $10,000 fine hasn’t even been returned to him, right?” asked Uche. “And then you reindict the case and you give him 30-months probation for a Class 4 felony with a man with no criminal record, felony record. Thirty-months probation, you give him 150 days in jail. You give him what else? You make him do restitution of$120,000.”The lawyer then claimed Smollett was the victim of a racist court system that sought to unfairly incarcerate black men. He also blasted the Judge James Linn for grand standing during sentencing and expressed hopes that the appellate hearing would yield better results for his client.“I’ve never seen that and I thought it was unprofessional, that’s my personal opinion,” Uche continued. “Not happy with that, and we look forward now that this case is gone to the appellate court to actually have finally an intellectual conversation about the constitutionality of this case and not playing politics.”Some legal experts disagree with Uche’s claim of double jeopardy as Smollett never submitted a plea when he paid his initial $10,000 fine to the state of Illinois.Smolett was convicted of lying to authorities about a staged hate crime committed against him. His release was quick to spark backlash with special prosecutor Dan Webb asserting there was “no emergency that warrants” the judge’s decision.","This booking photo provided by the Cook County Sheriff’s Office shows Jussie Smollett.

Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., prior to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivering a virtual address to Congress by video at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 16, 2022. (Sarah Silbiger, Pool via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:39 AM PT – Wednesday, March 16, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R- Ky.) criticized the Biden administration for not doing more to help Ukraine. He suggested anything that has been done to help the nation often comes too late.“Unfortunately, the administration keeps on dragging its heels,” asserted the Republican lawmaker. “Even when they do the right thing, they do it too late and the administration needs to get the message.”McConnell’s comments on Tuesday came ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s virtual address to Congress. The senator added, the administration seems to be worried about the repercussions that could arise due to helping Ukraine.“With regard to the ongoing war in Ukraine, it seems to me the President believes that any effort to help the Ukrainians is potentially provocative to the Russians,” McConnell stated. “Look, the provocations already occurred. The war is underway. We need to do any and everything we can to help our Ukrainian friends.”Additionally, while he said the U.S. won’t enforce a no-fly zone in Ukraine, McConnell stressed there are other things the U.S. could do to help Ukraine gain dominance in the air in its fight against Russia. The federal government’s decision last week not to back a plan to provide fighter jets to the Ukrainian Air Force is a move McConnell believes to be a big mistake.“We are not going to enforce a no-fly zone in Ukraine, but there are a lot of weapons that are extremely effective in controlling the air,” explained the Senate Minority Leader. “A good example of that are the MiGs that the Poles were anxious to send to Ukraine, which the administration apparently discouraged them from doing.”Putin’s initial aggression was just a small foretaste of what this thug had planned for Ukraine. America’s response will be measured carefully by our friends, by our adversaries, and by history itself. We cannot afford to fail this test.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:44 AM PT – Wednesday, March 16, 2022Ohioans can soon carry a concealed weapon without a permit. On Monday, state Governor Mike DeWine signed a bill into law eliminating the requirement of needing a conceal carry permit.The Senate bill will allow Ohio residents 21 years of age and older to legally own a gun without a permit or special training. It also removed the legal requirement for gun owners to tell police they are armed when stopped. This means law enforcement will have to ask, but lying will render a misdemeanor resulting up to six-months in jail.Supporters of the law noted, both the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions guarantee the right to bear arms while also mentioning it will make people safer by lifting restrictions on their ability to carry a concealed firearm to protect themselves.🎉🇺🇸 NRA VICTORY: Ohio Gov. @MikeDeWine JUST SIGNED NRA-Backed Constitutional Carry OHIO, Say HELLO to NO GOVERNMENT PERMISSION!— NRA (@NRA) March 14, 2022Buckeye Firearms Association Director, Dean Reick said this is a great moment for the history of Ohio.“What were trying to do is to allow Ohioans to exercise their Constitutional right without that burden because no other Constitutional right requires you to jump through that many hoops,” he stated.The measure, dubbed Constitutional Carry by its supporters, is one of several GOP-backed proposals in recent years seeking to expand gun rights. Despite people in Ohio no longer needing a gun license, residents will still need to apply for a permit if they plan to carry a concealed weapon over state lines.Meanwhile, Ohio will become the 23rd state to exercise their right to carry without having to go through red tape, despite many Democrat leaders saying the bill will make the state more dangerous. Furthermore, advocates for the law say it gains major ground in getting the Second Amendment restored.","Ohio Gov.

Police, Brevard is the prime suspect for their investigation into several crimes in the city, including the murder of 54-year-old and two cases of assault with a dangerous weapon.“Mr. Brevard was charged in each of the district’s three offenses,” Chief Contee continued. “Charges include first degree murder while armed for the shooting and stabbing homicide of 54-year-old Morgan Holmes on March 9, the assault with the intent to kill for the shooting offense on March 8 and assault with a dangerous weapon for the initial shooting offense on March 3. Additional charges for offenses committed in New York are anticipated.”Meanwhile in New York, Brevard remains a person of interest in an investigation of two incidents in which two homeless individuals were shot in their sleep.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the nations have a duty to help Ukraine and praised the Ukrainian people for fighting for their sovereignty.“I think already it is clear that (Vladimir) Putin has gravely miscalculated,” Johnson asserted.” He’s underestimated the heroism and determination of the Ukrainians to resist under President Zelensky. I think he’s also gravely underestimated the unity of the West, which is expressed not least in this meeting today.”Johnson also called out Russian forces for bombarding innocent civilians and firing on population centers.

Scott Applewhite)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:07 AM PT – Tuesday, March 15, 2022President Joe Biden has come under immense scrutiny by Republicans in the upper chamber, over his diplomatic efforts with Iran. On Monday, all but one GOP senator sent a letter to Biden urging him to stop trying to ink a deal with the Iranian regime to revive the controversial 2015 nuclear deal.The opponents of the deal led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) say it would be much weaker than the one former President Donald Trump withdrew from. The senators added, the current proposal would lift several restrictions and sanctions of Iran, which they say would kindle the country’s nuclear ambitions and aggression on regional rivals.“In Vienna, Biden diplomats have been furiously bending over backwards to surrender to the Ayatollah,” said Cruz. “The same Ayatollah who is a theocratic dispute, regularly chants ‘death to America and death to Israel.’ This administration wants nothing more than to give them hundred of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Money that would inevitably be used to murder Americans.”The urgency from the GOP senators come as various international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, warn Iran has enriched uranium to the point that it’s near a nuclear weapon. Additionally, officials have linked Iran to several acts of terror, including a recent airstrike launched near the U.S. consulate in Iraq.Several senators lament Iran’s disregard for the international rules and threats from America is a sign President Biden is a weak leader. Sen. Cruz further warned Biden’s negotiations will help out other adversaries to the U.S.“This Iran deal, if and when it is announce, will be a massive win for Vladimir Putin because the Biden administration has been eager to tell Putin and to tell the Ayatollah ‘of course, we will have a carve out for the Iran deal on Russia’s sanctions,’ which means Putin will make billions in oil and gas transactions, in nuclear transactions and in weapons transactions,” explained the Republican lawmaker. “Putin wants to be the leading arms dealers to the Ayatollah.”Meanwhile, both current Prime Minister of Israel Naftali Bennett and his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu believe a new Iran deal will further destabilize the Middle East. They stressed, their country has been targeted in several attacks from Iran and have warned of further acts of terror on their people as well as on the rest of the world.Every American family should watch this video. pic.twitter.com/BVo5ZFJwKk— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) March 13, 2022In the meantime, Biden is showing no signs of walking away from the negotiating table despite a snag in international talks following Russia’s recent demands.The sole dissenting Republican, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), warned lawmakers against pushing to end talks when there isn’t a finalized deal on the table yet. Paul asserted, “condemning a deal that is not yet formulated is akin to condemning diplomacy itself, is not a very thoughtful position.”Sen. Cruz holds a press conference on Iran:﻿","Sen.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:24 AM PT – Tuesday, March 15, 2022The Pentagon hosted a press conference to provide an update on the war in Ukraine. Department spokesperson John Kirby addressed a recent airstrike conducted on a training facility in Ukraine over the weekend.During the briefing Kirby revealed that the Florida National Guard conducted training exercises at the facility a few weeks prior to the attack, but that the facility was uninhabited at the time of the strike.“Our understanding is that these were cruise missiles fired from aircraft, long range, on the Yavoriv training facility there in Western Ukraine,” he explained. “I can assure you that there were no U.S. military personnel there at that training facility. That’s where the Florida National Guard had been doing their training before they left a few weeks ago. No U.S. contractors there, no U.S. civilians, no government, U.S. government personnel there at all.”Kirby also gave an update to the Pentagon’s reaction to Russia’s progress in the aftermath of the attack. He also confirmed the absence of any plans to establish a no-fly zone, stating Russia lacks the air superiority over Ukraine to justify the move.“It doesn’t change,” he noted. “I think our general understanding that they continue to be frustrated by a very stiff Ukrainian resistance and they are not making the kind of progress on the ground that we believe they thought they would be making by this point.”The briefing concluded with Kirby addressing the Biden administration’s efforts to send aid to Ukraine. According to the spokesman, they are close to running out of the $350 million package signed by President Joe Biden.“We’re nearly at the end of the $350 million package that the president signed over a week ago,” he stated. “We’ve got almost all of that into their hands. The remaining the remaining items should be arriving very, very soon. And then we are already at work trying to figure out what the next drawdown package of $200 million is going to look like.”LIVE: @PentagonPresSec John F.

(Ken Cedeno/Pool via AP, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:37 AM PT – Tuesday, March 15, 2022Embattled Democrat Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) says parents opposed to far-left ideologies being pushed in schools are just a part of a fringe movement. During a town hall event in New Jersey recently, the lawmaker claimed Florida’s Parental Eights in Education bill is going to lead to an increase in youth deaths.Malinowski added, parents opposed to critical race theory and gender theory in schools are just seeking power and are trying to distract from “real issues” like so-called climate change. The representative went on to suggest that those asking for parental rights are trying to ban books while supporting gun violence.“When I was talking about crazy, right, there are a lot of examples,” stated the Democrat. “And one of the crazy things happening in America right now is you’ve got a political movement that says they care about kids, but the way they express that care is by banning books. And they don’t want to do a damn thing about the guns.”Most agree the 2021 red wave was due to increased focus on parental rights issues by Republicans, which could spell trouble for Malinowski who is, after redistricting, in a Republican leaning district.","FILE – In this March 10, 2021, file photo, Rep.

In a joint press conference, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressed his frustration at the lack of urgency from Joe Biden’s White House. (AP PHOTO)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:42 PM PT – Monday, March 14, 2022Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been bloody and unceasing since first beginning over two weeks ago. One proposal has received major attention in recent days, which is for Poland to give its MiG-29 jets for Ukraine to use while the U.S. gives Poland replacement jets.On Sunday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the White House is considering the MiGs to be offensive weapons.On part of this, the federal government feels such a move could place the U.S. in the middle of the conflict while also escalating it.“But the key thing here is that President Biden looked at the assessment of our Intelligence Community, took the advice of his military commanders, consulted with his NATO allies, and ultimately determined that the cost benefit analysis did not justify flying fighter planes from a U.S. base in Germany into contested airspace,” Sullivan explained.Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) disagrees with this assessment. He, alongside other senators, traveled to Poland and has advocated from Washington and Poland for the transfer of the MiG jets. According to him, it doesn’t matter what Russia says about this causing an escalation as they claim everything NATO does is an escalatory action.“The Russians have complained about everything,” said Portman. “Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war. They certainly complained when we provided Stingers directly from the U.S. government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes. We have given them helicopters. As recently as January, we provided them U.S. military helicopters.”Great meeting with USAID who are doing fantastic work in Ukraine to provide humanitarian assistance to those who need it most. pic.twitter.com/ycr8KDj1WI— Rob Portman (@senrobportman) March 13, 2022Republicans aren’t the only ones who are going against the White House. Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has also been advocating for the transfer of the planes. While speaking from Poland as well she said she understands the White House position, but still will be pushing for the transfer.“I made clear to them, I spoke to the President himself about 10 days ago about this,” Klobuchar explained. “I’d like to see the planes over there, but remember things shift. As things become a target, because there’s so much public discussion about them, that can become an issue itself.”While the White House is ruling out, for now, the transfer of the jets, billions of dollars in weapons sales and humanitarian aid is still flowing into Ukraine as they fight back against Vladimir Putin’s ongoing assault on their nation’s sovereignty.","Several Senate Republicans continue to drill the Biden administration after denying Poland’s proposal to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

He said a fourth dose of the coronavirus vaccine will be necessary.During an interview on Sunday, Bourla affirmed that just like the flu shot, the vaccine could become a yearly occurrence for Americans.“Right now, the way that we have seen, it is necessary a fourth booster right now,” he stated. “The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It’s not that good against infections. It doesn’t last very long, but we are just submitting those data to the FDA and then we will see what the experts also will say outside Pfizer.”The CEO said Pfizer is working diligently to make a vaccine that can protect against all variants for at least a year. Bourla reiterated this during this interview. His comments came after mixed messaging regarding Pfizer and Biontech’s third booster shot as well as the FDA’s expanded use of a single booster dose to kids ages 12-to-15 in January.In the meantime, Bourla said the industry, CDC and FDA must better coordinate in order to prevent further confusion amongst the American people.","FILE – Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla attends a ceremony in the northern city of Thessaloniki, Greece, Oct. 12, 2021.

In an interview on Sunday, Kristalina Georgieva said the impact of sanctions have been quite severe for the Russian economy and the ruble has significantly depreciated.She noted, the organization expects a deep recession. Georgieva also pointed out incomes are already shrinking in Russia and the Russian population is losing purchasing power. The IMF managing director also suggested Russia may default on its foreign debt.“In terms of servicing debt obligations, I can say that no longer we think of Russian default as improbable event,” Georgieva explained. “Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it.”The official also said the organization’s interactions with Ukraine have been very productive and praised the Ukrainian government for how it’s handled emergency funding provided to them.Meanwhile, Russia is preparing for the fourth round of talks with Ukraine. It’s foreign ministry said the new round of peace talks will begin in Belarus. Moscow reiterated its peace proposal, saying Ukraine must de-militarize and accept a non-aligned status in global affairs.Over the past two-weeks, Russian forces established control over 89 cities in Eastern and Southern Ukraine as well as neutralized 90 percent of Ukraine’s military infrastructure.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:52 AM PT – Monday, May 2, 2022The faster November approaches, the more bullish Republicans and more concerned Democrats become about what the results could look like. Polls show Republicans ahead in the generic ballot with an average lead of more than four points over the Democrats.On Sunday, anti-Trump Republican Will Hurd went onto CNN to explain why he feels his party is in good straits going into November. He said that having been the sole Republican elected to a border district in Texas, the ongoing Biden border crisis is a safety issue for residents there. On part of that, he predicts that record numbers of Hispanic voters will choose Republicans giving the party three seats in that region alone.“You’re going to see near record turnout, if not record turnout, of Latino’s for Republicans,” Hurd stated. “Primarily because of the issue of border security and if you live on the border, border security is a public safety issue. And this is going to fuel some of the fact that you’re likely to have three of the five representatives that represent the Texas-Mexico border being Republicans.”Even Democrats are beginning to express concern over the increasing chances they face impending doom in November. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren believes her party is headed for disaster at the ballot box because they haven’t done everything they promised to do. She said that President Joe Biden, for example, can and should unilaterally transfer student debt away from debtors to general taxpayers while claiming it’s a popular move.Warren noted that while the party has some legislative accomplishments under its belt, the party is going to lose bad if they don’t push harder for government to work better for working families. She suggested they are “going to be in real trouble” if they don’t “get up and deliver.”With people across the political spectrum agreeing that Republicans will probably win the House, the margin of victory is open for speculation. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich believes the red wave will turn out to be more of a red tsunami.If conservatives can build a performance-based message on the themes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, we can govern with a long-term, stable American majority rather than a shorter-lived Republican majority.https://t.co/VIGrrL8ftR— Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) May 2, 2022Gingrich believes that Republicans could win a historic 70 seats from Democrats, giving the party an advantage of more than 120 seats over Democrats. This would be the first time either party would have a triple-digit majority since Democrats won the 1990 midterms.“I think we’ll pick up between 25 and 70 seats in the House, we’ll probably pick up about four seats at least in the Senate,” Gingrich noted. “I think that people like Herschel Walker are going to do very very well. In addition, I would say that if you’re in a district that Biden carried by less than 15 or 20 points, you’re in great danger as a Democrat.”If polls continue to hold where they are, as they have been for months, Democrats could be facing a historic defeat for a midterm election year. Primary elections begin in earnest on Tuesday and the whole nation goes to vote for their next representatives in November.","Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-GA) speaks during the Orange County Liberty Counsel Forum at Aloma Baptist Church January 28, 2012 in Winter Park, Florida.

He asserted that Pence did the right thing that day and believes the Indiana native wants to tell his side of the story.“I would hope and think that the vice president would want to come in and tell his story because he did do the right thing on that day,” Kinzinger stated. “If he doesn’t, then we’ll look at the options we have available to us if there’s information we don’t already have.”GOP Rep.

During an interview with CNN Sunday, the Republican said the legislation, which bans sex discussions for children under nine in schools, is common sense.According to him, Disney has overstepped its bounds opposing the legislation. However, he also believes Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) has gone too far against Disney by working to abolish the Reedy Creek Development District.“The law that was passed is to me common sense that in those grades, those lower grades, you shouldn’t be teaching sexual orientation and those matters that should not be covered in at that age,” Hutchinson stated. “But I don’t believe that government should be punitive against private businesses because we disagree with them.”“So DeSantis overstepped?”“Well, I disagree with it.”CNN’s @DanaBashCNN asks Gov.
