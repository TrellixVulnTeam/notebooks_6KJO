7:05 AM PT","Sen. Cruz: Dems, mainstream media unfairly target gun owners","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has been adamantly speaking out against gun control proposals by Democrats while suggesting officials need to increase security in schools. On Thursday, the Republican spoke with reporters at a vigil for shooting victims in Uvalde, Texas. He said Democrats and the media are unfairly politicizing the tragic event.Cruz added, attacks on schools can be prevented without taking away constitutional rights of Americans. He then stressed that Second Amendment rights must be protected. When asked by a reporter if this was the moment to reform gun laws, Cruz explained that the mainstream media typically likes to go in that direction. He then called on reporters to stop being “propagandist.”“Why is it that people come from all over the world to America?” Cruz asked as a follow-up question. “Because it’s the freest, most prosperous, safest country on earth.”Meanwhile, during a televised interview on Thursday, the Texas senator said Democrats politicize mass shootings to unfairly target Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. Cruz added, Democrats are also trying to demonize the National Rifle Association. The senator reaffirmed his plan to speak at an upcoming NRA convention in Houston.Sen.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:27 PM PT – Thursday, May 26, 2022Several Florida residents were honored for their life saving actions to help land a small plane after the pilot suffered a medical emergency. On Thursday, the group was acknowledged by Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center during a news conference. The group included air traffic controllers, medical doctors and passengers of the plane.Pilot Kenneth Allen was able to share his side of the story for the first time. The 64-year-old pilot recalled the moment he lost consciousness while flying ten thousand feet above the Florida coast on May 10, in turn, forcing a passenger with no flying experience to take control of the plane.“I remember telling Russ and Daren that I didn’t feel well,” Allen recalled. “My head was pounding and I was seeing little blue lights sparkling through here. They asked me what that means and I said I don’t know, I have a really bad headache. Then I remember them poking me on the side of the arm saying “stay with me, stay with me.” That was it, I can’t really recall anything until my guys over here were pulling me out of the airplane.”After Allen passed out, the passenger later, identified as Lakeland resident Darren Harrison, can be heard telling the air traffic controller he was not an experienced pilot and that he could tell he was facing the coast.“I’ve got a serious situation here,” Harrison said. “My pilot has gone incoherent. I have no idea how to fly the airplane.”Harrison took control of the plane and managed to land at the Palm Beach International Airport with the help of Air Traffic Control.“I knew if I didn’t react that we would die,” he stated. “I reached over his body because at this point he’s unresponsive. I grabbed the controls of the airplane and slowly started to pull back on the stick and turn.”Both Harrison and the other passenger credited Air Traffic Controller Robert Morgan for safely guiding them to the landing strip. Allen reportedly suffered a torn aorta during the incident, a typically catastrophic injury, which the Doctor’s who treated him asserted could have just as easily ended his life. Less than a week after the operation, Allen was up and about.","FORT LAUDERDALE, FL – JULY 14: A Delta airlines plane is seen as it comes in for a landing at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on July 14, 2016 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

While the US Senate stands idly by and activist federal judges strike down commonsense gun laws across our nation, California will act with the urgency this crisis demands. The Second Amendment is not a suicide pact. We will not let one more day go by without taking action to save lives.”Although California already has stringent gun control laws in place, Governor Newsom and legislative leaders will continue working together to expedite additional bills pending that can contribute to the end of gun violence.","California Gov.

We will not stop fighting for the people of Oklahoma and for everyone across the country.”The law would be enforced by private citizens, giving them the ability to sue abortion providers and others who help a woman terminate a pregnancy for up to $10,000.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:29 AM PT – Friday, May 27, 2022Senate Republicans blocked a domestic terrorism bill while asserting it would dangerously expand the government’s surveillance powers. On Thursday, the measure failed along party lines. At least 10 Republican votes were needed to advance.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced the bill in response to a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo. It would have created new federal offices to increase focus on domestic terrorism threats in coordination with Homeland Security, the DOJ and the FBI.Republicans have been skeptical of the legislation. They believe the bill could lead to the policing of political speech and claimed it’s an updated version of the Patriot Act to surveil Americans. Democrats have tied the issue to firearms and are pushing for gun control, while echoing calls for the measures approval following the massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called the bill an insult to every police officer in the country.“This is a filtration of the uniformed services and federal law enforcement,” Paul said. “This is not just an insult to your local police or to the marines, to the army, to the navy, his is an insult to the FBI, its an insult to the capital police. This bill says that they’ve been infiltrated. This says that our police are consumed with some kind of race rage. It’s untrue, it’s slander, it’s scandalous.”The bill was not expected to pass after it received GOP support in the House. It only gained one Republican vote from Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) slammed Republicans in his push to get the bill passed.“Many Republicans have made their opposition clear,” stated Schumer. “There are a lot of MAGA Republicans for whom no amount of gun violence, whether it’s domestic terrorism, a school shooting, a neighborhood shooting or something else, will ever, ever convince them to take any action.”Today, the Senate is voting on the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to help combat a serious cause of gun violence:Domestic terrorism and white supremacyIt will give the government the tools to monitor, find, & arrest evil actors before they have a chance to inflict violence— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) May 26, 2022Schumer voiced he will hold bipartisan negotiations in the Senate in the coming weeks to try and hammer out a compromised bill.","Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., looks over his notes before speaking to reporters at a news conference following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 24, 2022.

However, many everyday Americans, like Dan Johnson of Pennsylvania, have plans they can’t miss.“My wife’s family, her sister is graduating from Tufts University in Boston, so we really didn’t have a choice and we just toughed it up,” Johnson explaned. “And you know, whatever the gas price is, we unfortunately just have to pay for it. But, you know, we want to go visit our family, so this is the cost that’s involved.”Good luck with gas prices this Memorial Day weekend.— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) May 27, 2022The spike in fuel costs is likely due to the cost of crude oil and President Joe Biden’s multiple energy policy failures. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) spoke on the issues at hand ahead of the big travel holiday.“As you travel this Memorial Day weekend, think about how much more it’s costing you to fill up your car,” he noted. “Then remember that restricting the supply and raising the price of American energy is a premeditated part of the Democrats’ radical agenda.”Gas prices are 51% higher than last Memorial Day weekend, and 135% higher than during Memorial Day weekend in 2020.— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) May 27, 2022It appears there is no end in sight for record-high fuel prices as the pain at the pump continues for Americans.
