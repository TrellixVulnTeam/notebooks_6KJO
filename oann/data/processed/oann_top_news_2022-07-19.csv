1:27 PM PT",Wis. Speaker Vos says state may re-do 2020 election if fraud is proven in court,"Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the state may have to re-do the 2020 presidential election. While speaking at a Wisconsin GOP press conference, he explained it is generally not possible to overturn results of an election.However, Vos then noted if evidence of 2020 election fraud in the state if proven in courts then the State Assembly will have to act and likely hold a new election. His remarks came after the Wisconsin Supreme Court outlawed ballot dropboxes and ruled they can only be installed inside polling stations.Vos is now expected to provide courts with election probe records by former State Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman. Former President Donald Trump recently criticized Vos for taking too long to challenge 2020 fraud and for being indecisive about ongoing election litigation.","FILE – Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos talks to the media in the Assembly chambers during the governor’s State of the State speech at the state Capitol Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2022, in Madison, Wis.

Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) who said in a Sunday interview that the committee expects to receive deleted messages sent between January 5 and January 6 from the federal law enforcement agency. Lofgren explained she wants to see all of the texts to determine if there was malicious intent.“We need all the texts from the fifth and the sixth of January,” she stated. “I was shocked to hear that they didn’t back up their data when they reset their iPhones, that’s crazy I don’t know why that would be, but we need to get this information to get the full picture.”A spokesperson for the Secret Service has said there was no malicious intent when deleting the messages, instead suggesting it was due to a forgotten backup when resetting the phones. The agency, which was subpoenaed by the January 6 Committee on Friday, has denied any intentional wrongdoing and has agreed to cooperate with the investigation fully.Lofgren continued by saying, “I’m going to let the hearings speak for itself, but we hope to go through minute by minute what happened, what didn’t happen on that day and people can make their own judgment.”The Democrat House committee member said she hopes to get the messages by Tuesday. Meanwhile, a Monmouth poll found that the majority of Americans are not giving any notice to the January 6 hearings. According to to data gathered in June, less than a quarter of people said they are paying attention.The January 6 hearings have continued from Washington with the goal to discredit and dismiss the political future of former President Donald Trump. However, critics have continued to call out fundamental flaws in the hearings. One America’s Chief White House Correspondent Chanel Rion has more.","FILE – From left, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Rep.

Joe Moody answers questions during a news conference after the Texas House investigative committee released its full report on the shootings at Robb Elementary School, Sunday, July 17, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:50 AM PT – Monday, July 18, 2022May 24, 2022 marked a day that changed the community of Uvalde, Texas forever. Nineteen students and two teachers were killed after a gunman entered Robb Elementary School.On Sunday, the Texas House Investigative Committee released a 77-page interim report compiled with their findings and said multiple failures by several entities could have been avoided. While the committee noted they didn’t find any “villains” other than the attacker through the course of its investigation, there were multiple situations that foreshadowed the tragedy.Here’s my statement on the interim report released today by the Texas House Investigative Committee on the Robb Elementary Shooting. #txlege pic.twitter.com/V7ZbZVXIDi— Dade Phelan (@DadePhelan) July 17, 2022The report started with the school. According to the committee, Robb Elementary was not adequately prepared for an armed intruder. This is how the 18-year-old attacker to was able to gain entry. The shooter proceeded to go into rooms 111 and 112, rapidly firing over 100 rounds between both classrooms for about two and a half minutes. Notably, room 111 had a faulty lock that had been reported to the school administration several times prior.Before the attack, the committee said the gunman’s sole desire was for notoriety and fame. the report indicates the plan was a thought since late 2021, but didn’t start rolling into motion until the attacker turned 18 in May. One week before the incident, he purchased two rifles and over 2,000 rounds of ammunition. He had no prior experience with firearms and the investigation found the Uvalde shooting was likely the first time he had ever fired a weapon.Online interactions involving the attacker also signaled the tragedy. On the day of the attack, he shot his grandmother in the face “marking the beginning of the end for Rob Elementary’.’ Surveillance footage captured the shooter crashing his vehicle after he apparently lost control on the way to the school. Reports of the shooting first came in after a teacher saw someone dressed in all black toss a backpack over the fence and pull out a gun.In examination of the response, 376 law enforcement officers in total responded to the tragedy. They failed to follow active shooter training and failed to prioritize victims safety over their own. The Chief of Police did not act as incident commander, which is directed in Uvalde CISD’s active shooter plan and the position was not performed by anyone on the scene.The report says, “a command post could have changed chaos into order,” adding it could have also sparked greater urgency to officers inside to immediately breach the classroom. Officers wouldn’t enter the classroom and take the shooter out for over an hour. The committee said first responders “lost critical momentum” by treating the shooter as a “barricaded subject.” It added, at this time committee members “do not know whether responders could have saved more lives by shortening that delay.”Meanwhile, state lawmakers will now review the report and decide how changes can be made to ensure safety in Texas.","Texas state Rep.

In an interview Sunday, the Republican said Biden must increase oil production here in the US instead of begging foreign countries for more oil.The governor also attacked Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over allegations of human rights abuses in the oil rich kingdom. Ducey said bringing down gas prices is easy and it does not require any foreign trips.“What he could do is open up the Keystone Pipeline, what he could do is work with America’s energy leaders and provide more supply of fossil fuels, of clean energy and solve this crisis,” asserted the Republican. “He’s going to have to make that decision. We’re not going to do anything in Arizona that’s temporary or a gimmick or puts my successor in a terrible spot with the voters.”Ducey stressed that it’s very important that Biden shows leadership from the White House to solve problems facing America. His remarks come as other GOP lawmakers have called into question the national security implications of the Biden administration’s transfer from the Strategic Oil Reserve to a Chinese oil company. This occurred directly ahead of Biden’s trip to the Middle East.We have everything we need to solve the energy crisis right here in America. Once again, Biden looks in all the wrong places. https://t.co/a6hWPIIr23— Doug Ducey (@DougDucey) July 17, 2022Meanwhile, Sen.

Jayapal accused Trump of unleashing racism and white supremacy when he occupied the White House.“What has happened is that the person that occupied the White House, the highest office in the land, actually used and unleashed and mobilized all of that violence and white supremacy using the tools of the federal government,” asserted the Democrat. “Using bans on Muslims, bans on trans folks, calling out people to be racist.”I'm sitting down to talk about what happened to me because it was not a coincidence.

Dicken fired 10 shots from his Glock handgun.“His actions were nothing short of heroic,” voiced Greenwood Police Chief Jason Ison. “He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun.

The organization first received national attention when it fought against mask mandates in schools and later when it opposed curriculum related to LGBTQ rights, race and discrimination.“There are a lot of really nice and well-meaning people there,” DeVos voiced. “I don’t mean to disparage them in any way, but they are definitely oriented around being in their roles for probably most of their careers, if not all of them.”… says the guy who needlessly kept schools closed for nearly two years, because the union bosses made him.Putting parents in charge of education decisions wouldn't ""destroy"" public education.

During an event organized by the American Institute Enterprise last month, DeVos described dealing with an agency full of career bureaucrats.“Really for any of the creative reforms that we advanced we really had to essentially work around most of the career staff,” she said. “Because there were very few who would actually get the work done that needed to be done or would present options that weren’t even close to what we were attempting to do.”Former Secretary of Education @BetsyDeVos tells me she had a plan to ABOLISH the Department of Education and return the power to parents, but Congress wasn't interested: ""Bottom line, there was no action taken.

During her tenure, DeVos controversially worked to reduce her department’s authority over schools. She introduced cuts to federal education spending and rolling back federal guidelines in favor of letting states and local districts decide their own policy.Her comments come after Rep.

Two single engine planes collided with each other Sunday afternoon, over the North Las Vegas Airport. Officials said one of the planes was preparing to land when the other hit it. Two people were aboard each plane and all four died in the incident.The airport is located just north of downtown Las Vegas and is mainly used by smaller aircraft. A local pilot said there has been concerns raised over the frequent traffic at the airport.“There’s a lot of traffic, so it’s always a concern about how well the airport system and flights are managed coming in and out of the airport,” said Dore Rodine, a pilot who has a plane hangared at North Las Vegas Airport.Incident Alert- at aprox 12pm today NLVFD and LVFR crews responded to a report of a mid air collision at the North Las Vegas airport. At this time there are 4 reported fatalities. Accident is still under investigation. pic.twitter.com/HhyeCDLrnE— CNLV Fire Department (@NLVFireDept) July 17, 2022Still, Rodine said this crash took him by surprise given the airport’s features.“It’s very wide open,” he stated. “There’s not a lot of buildings or structures in this area and with an active control tower at the time that it occurred, I’m really surprised that there wasn’t better terrain awareness. Either by one of the pilots or by the control tower.”The administration categorized the collision as an accident. Meanwhile, the identities of the four people killed in the crash have yet to be released.","Officials investigate the wreckage of a plane at the site of a fatal crash at the North Las Vegas Airport, Sunday, July 17, 2022, in North Las Vegas, Nev.

(Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP, Pool, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:58 PM PT – Monday, July 18, 2022The penalty trial for the Parkland shooter is underway. A panel of 22 people, 12 jurors and 10 alternates were sworn in on Monday. The trial is expected to last months, but will ultimately determine the fate of the man who pleaded guilty to 17 counts of first degree murder in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Nikolas Cruz took the lives of 14 students, a teacher, a coach and an athletic director at the high school on Feb. 14, 2018.Opening statements reportedly took up the majority of Monday’s hearing. The defense let prosecutors have their say and have their way. Assistant Public Defender Melisa McNeill chose to reserve the team’s opening statement until the prosecution is finished presenting its case. Prosecutor Mike Satz called seven witnesses to the stand. The defense did not ask a single question of any of them.“We were sitting ducks,” said said Danielle Gilbert, who recorded the first series of cellphone videos shown to the jury. “There was no way to protect ourselves.” Gilbert was a junior at Stoneman Douglas at the time. The videos showed students and a teacher hiding in fear as about two dozen gunshots were fired nearby. Although her body is not seen until the final video clip, victim Carmen Schentrup was already dead just a few yards away from Gilbert.HORRIFIC!   You can hear the endless gunshots from #NikolasCruz and he's killing students.  Danielle Gilbert recorded him on her cellphone. The gallery can hear but not see the video.

Family members of his victims leaned on each other for support. Some couldn’t take it and left the room. Another could not wait five seconds into a video clip before declaring she’d had enough.“Shut it off!” called out a family member of a victim.Satz claimed that Cruz had planned to be a school shooter for a long time. He described a video that Cruz made three days before the killing where he bragged that he was going to be the “next school shooter” and that he hoped to kill at least 20.Prosecutors replayed the horrific day and detailed the shooter’s methodical plan. They said he was “cold, calculated and deadly.”","FILE – Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz is shown at the defense table during jury selection in the penalty phase of his trial at the Broward County Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Tuesday, June 28, 2022.

According to reports Monday, the nation’s highest paid unelected bureaucrat plans to retire before he can serve under an eighth administration.Dr. Fauci is currently 81-years-old and has been working for the federal government for over 50 years. He has been at the NIAID since 1984 and has spent the majority of his career studying HIV, Ebola and other highly infections diseases.

2:00 PM PT",Dr. Birx claims much of her Covid guidance was arbitrary,"Dr. Birx claims much of her Covid guidance was arbitraryOAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, July 18, 2022Dr. Deborah Birx. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Former White House COVID Response Coordinator Doctor Deborah Birx came clean about the guidance she gave to slow the spread. On Sunday, The Post Millennial reported on Birx’s testimony before Congress and her new book “Silent Invasion.”She admitted in both that the CDC data didn’t help her make clear public health recommendations. Birx’s plan that was two weeks long to slow the spread was apparently based on statistics from other countries not the US. The existing CDC data wasn’t of any use, Birx said. She picked apart the CDC’s approach and voiced that they should have been more forceful in their data collection and in going to states and demanding information.“I couldn’t do anything that would reveal my true intention,” she wrote. “To use the travel ban as one brick in the construction of a larger wall of protective measures we needed to enact very soon. Trump’s team was more concerned about the impacts and potential for loss of lives to Americans of shutting society down. She blasts the administration for their concerns over the economy, concerns which have played out in real time to the point where the country could be facing devastating impacts, as is the globe.Before posting my final review of D. Birx's book, I offer you one more excerpt on how she doctored the weekly Covid reports to the states coming from the White House. You won't believe this one. pic.twitter.com/saYjSzPhpc— Jeffrey A Tucker (@jeffreyatucker) July 16, 2022Birx urged solutions to the problem of data collection. She said that “there remains a lack of emphasis on active testing and there is still no sense of urgency to find the silent community invasion that occurs days to weeks before symptoms.” Birx lamented that looking back they were not more stern in their approach to guidance. She explained that it is concerning that people would not “prioritize the health of others over their own personal liberty” and noted that early data from Europe showed widespread compliance.“I don’t know,” she admitted. “All I know is there was evidence from the global pandemic that natural reinfection was occurring. Since the vaccine was based on natural immunity you cannot make the conclusion that the vaccine will do better than natural infection, although it can often do slightly better.”She said the US had a “silent spread” and there was no way to track it. The doctor claimed this is what led to continuing lockdowns for over a year.",Dr. Deborah Birx.

(CDC via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:00 PM PT – Monday, July 18, 2022Officials at all levels of government are growing more worried about the spread of Monkeypox. Democrat lawmakers, Big Pharma and the World Health Organization are coming together to sound the alarm on the viral disease. Taking to the corporate airwaves Sunday, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monkeypox cases are increasing in the capital and the city needs at least 100,000 vaccine doses to respond to the current surge which can cause a potential spike in the future.LIVE: Mayor Bowser Provides Update on Monkeypox Outbreak and Response Efforts https://t.co/1PVKf2vUz0— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) July 18, 2022This comes as Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine recently took to Twitter and urged the federal government to send the Big Apple more vaccines. He revealed that New York City has 30 percent of all Monkeypox cases in the US, while having a disproportionately low number of the government’s vaccine supply. For her part, Mayor Bowser claimed that cities with robust testing resources will see more cases confirmed.“We need more doses and we know that work is being done,” said Bowser. “We already have a very robust testing regime and we’ve modeled it on what we’re able to do with COVID. We’re going to continue to test and I think because of that robust testing we’re going to see more cases.”The window for containing the spread of monkeypox in NYC is closing fast. Cases have more than doubled in the past week.In a bad case of deja vu we are again confronting shortages of testing, treatment & vaccine.Here’s our plan for aggressive action to meet this challenge. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/afZ1DKzIFL— Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) July 18, 2022However, former FDA chief under President Trump and coincidentally now a Pfizer executive Scott Gottlieb has a more dire assessment of the latest virus. Gottlieb warned that the Biden administration has failed to contain Monkeypox and would categorize the virus’s spread as a pandemic. He further lamented that the Biden administration will likely be reluctant to own up to its mistakes and it’s downplaying the spread.“I think they’re going to be reluctant to use the word pandemic because it complies that they’ve failed to contain this,” Gottlieb stated. “I think at this point we’ve failed to contain this. We’re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus where this now becomes something that is persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think that the window for getting control of this and containing this probably has closed and if it hasn’t closed it’s certainly starting to close. 11,000 cases across the world right now. 1,800 cases in the US and we’re probably just detecting a fraction of the actual cases.”The pharma executive went on to say that there is only one FDA approved vaccine for Monkeypox and the federal government has to now go through the complicated inspection, approval and distribution processes at the same time. Gottlieb did commend the Biden administration for taking responsibility for the response from the CDC, but he argued that the White House should not have to take control of medical emergencies when there are institutions designed to handle those. He added that this is exactly what happened with the Covid-19 pandemic when President Trump was forced to take action amid a timid response by the medical establishment.“The white house has intervened to take more control of the response away from CDC,” the doctor voiced. “This can’t be our response every time that the CDC drops the ball. The White House and political leadership needs to step in. That’s what happened here. It happened in COVID.”Since May, DC has reported 122 #Monkeypox cases. In response, we've:✅Administered 2600+ vaccines & continue to book appointments for eligible residents✅Used contact tracing to identify 450+ close contacts✅Acquired TPOXX, an antiviral treatment for use by healthcare partners— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) July 18, 2022Meanwhile, the WHO is debating whether to call the Monkeypox spread a global health emergency. The body recently updated the public on the nearly 10,000 cases confirmed over the past few months. It also recently reported Monkeypox cases tripled across Europe which made health officials in neighboring regions concerned about a potential massive surge. WHO officials worried that the number of confirmed cases may not account for the real number of cases.“Testing remains a challenge and it’s highly probable that there are a significant number of cases not being picked up,” expressed WHO officials. “Europe is the current epicenter of the outbreak, recording more than 80 percent of cases globally.”In the meantime, a WHO emergency committee is expected to meet on Thursday to assess the threat of Monkeypox. Additionally, doctor Gottlieb claimed there won’t be an explosion of cases that come in the future. He pointed to the slow progression from contraction to showing symptoms.Gottlieb also said lawmakers in Washington D.C. desperately need to reform its emergency response tactics. He said if those protocols remain the same then the US will be behind whenever a new pandemic hits US shores.","This 1997 image provided by the CDC during an investigation into an outbreak of monkeypox, which took place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formerly Zaire, and depicts the dorsal surfaces of the hands of a monkeypox case patient, who was displaying the appearance of the characteristic rash during its recuperative stage.

That’s according to a new poll released Sunday that surveyed over 1,000 registered voters. According to the data, 44 percent would vote for a generic GOP candidate compared to 41 percent who would back a Democrat.Forty-one percent of participants were Democrats, 41 percent were Republican and 19 percent were independent. Some analysts predict Republicans have a strong chance to take the majority of the body due to Democrats focusing on cultural and social issues, instead of economic issues.Meanwhile, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said voters are focusing on avoiding an economic catastrophe and not on who will be president in 2024. During an interview Sunday, the Republican stressed the November election will be a referendum on President Joe Biden and the Democrat Party’s failed policies over the past two years..@JoeBiden’s reckless spending & raging inflation are pushing our nation & American families to the breaking point.Build Back Better?

He pointed out Democrats are on the wrong side of those issues. The Florida lawmaker then blasted Democrats for being “do-nothing people” who just want to raise taxes, so they can spend taxpayers’ money.“My proposal is do what I did as governor, get everybody back to work,” he stated. “When I was governor I added 1.7 million jobs. That’s how you get everybody to have skin in the game. But the Democrats, they want to spend your money.”Scott went on to stress, Americans are feeling the pain of Democrat failed policies, adding that will likely lead to a “bloodbath” for Democrats in the midterm elections.","A woman votes in the presidential primary election at the the Summit View Church of the Nazarene in Kansas City, Mo., on March 10, 2020.Charlie Riedel / AP file",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/200521-missouri-voting-al-1012-e1656715614110.jpg," Rep.
