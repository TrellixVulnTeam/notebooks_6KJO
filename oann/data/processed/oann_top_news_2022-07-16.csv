6:30 AM PT","Treasury Secy. Yellen, GOP senators discuss economic crisis","Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen weighed-in on the latest inflation numbers while Republicans continue to blast the Biden administration over the rising costs of goods. While speaking out on the efforts by Biden officials to improve the economy, she pointed out that inflation is unacceptably highDuring a news conference Thursday, Yellen asserted the Biden administration’s top economic priority is to bring inflation down. She claimed the labor market is currently very strong and in good shape, despite inflation hitting a 40-year record high this week.The Treasury secretary also said she would continue to push hard for a cap on the price of Russian oil to avoid future surges in oil prices. The official also said the administration is very supportive of the Federal Reserves efforts to lower inflation amid a number of recent interest rate hikes by the Central Bank.“Also the work that we’re doing to institute the price cap on Russian oil to avoid potential future spikes in oil prices,” Yellen noted. “We’re very supportive of deficit reduction and very much hope that Congress will pass the reconciliation bill that would help lower some of the important costs faced by consumers.Her remarks came after GOP senators expressed alarm about inflation during a press briefing on Capitol Hill Wednesday. Republicans said the Biden administration needs to stop the reckless spending and increase production of supplies including oil in the US.Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) contends Democrat policies and laws that have drastically increased daily living expenses for Americans are to blame for the current economic crisis. He called on Democrats to stop federal spending and stop proposing tax hikes.Biden & the Democrats’ “solution” to inflation is a tax increase—which will raise prices even higher.They’re literally making a bad situation even worse. pic.twitter.com/cMTc4ADRDn— Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) July 14, 2022Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) called out the Biden administration for failing to provide answers on how to they will alleviate the economic crisis. He noted, inflation could have been avoided if Democrats did not pass their $1.5 trillion spending package.Our current inflation crisis is the direct result of policy choices by Washington Democrats and is forcing the average U.S. household to spend an extra $5,200 this year. pic.twitter.com/ihkk5x2cdK— Senator Todd Young (@SenToddYoung) July 14, 2022Republicans also said President Biden’s rhetoric does not match the reality most Americans are facing.

Kathy Hochul speaks to reporters in the Red Room at the state Capitol, July 1, 2022, about legislation passed during a special legislative session, in Albany, N.Y. (AP Photo/Hans Pennink, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:59 AM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced new funding aimed at preventing gun crime. During a Thursday press conference, the Democrat announced her state is investing $220 million into preventing what she claims to be an influx of firearms entering in from other states. This includes $20 million for law enforcement despite her interest in removing the NYPD’s qualified immunity, which would force officers to pay for their own legal fees should they be accused of misconduct.” I said, you know what? Let’s triple that amount of money,” stated the governor. “Okay, let’s triple that. So that’s exactly the $20 million that we’re investing in snug type programs as well as money for law enforcement, for retraining and to help them have strategies to reduce crime because we are better off when we are partnering together to reduce crime overall, are we not?”Furthermore, Hochul said funds would be spent on establishing nonprofits and hospitals in areas where they have seen an uptick in gun related crimes. An additional $2 million will be used to to respond to the trauma experienced by gun crime victims.I’m in Brooklyn announcing funding to fight gun violence, support victims and survivors, and bolster our state’s response to this public health crisis. Watch live: https://t.co/bkryrPS4Dl— Governor Kathy Hochul (@GovKathyHochul) July 14, 2022This comes in spite of Hochul’s recent signing of the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, which prevents an individual from carrying a handgun in areas classified as sensitive locations. She then went to double down on her efforts to circumvent the Supreme Court’s ruling, which struck down New York’s good cause provision for their concealed carry law.“So I will close by saying we’re going to continue changing our laws,” stated the governor. “We allowed more extreme risk order protections. You’ve heard about them. You know, they are when you know someone shows signs of doing danger, something harmful themselves and others. We actually are not powerless any longer that people can see. I see that. We’re going to have training across the state for teachers and businesses and law enforcement and organizations like yours.”In the meantime, New York has begun implementing new policies to make getting a concealed carry license difficult by having individuals turn over items and information such as their social media history.","FILE – New York Gov.

Wade. The Thursday hearing witnesses list included notable pro-life activists, academics and legal experts.The vastly different priorities of the two parties were evident as Democrats and the pundits they host present the repeal of federal abortion as a slippery slope towards absolute tyranny.“We are in the midst of an extreme right wing assault by an illegitimate Supreme Court majority on woman’s rights, reproductive rights, martial rights, family planning rights, civil rights, voting rights, labor rights, and the right to liberty and justice for all,” stated Rep. Hakeem Jefferies (D-N.Y. “An assault by an illegitimate Supreme Court majority and a right wing movement here in this country determined to jam it’s values down the throats of the American people.”GOP Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) pointed out Justice Alito’s majority opinion provided no indication the court was eyeing to repeal gay or interracial marriage among the other issues Democrats cited.Republican lawmakers turned their attention to the recent attacks on pro-life pregnancy centers that offer education, free ultrasounds, prenatal vitamins and baby clothes to women seeking to give birth. This comes as more than 50 pregnancy centers nationwide have been vandalized since the momentous supreme court decision.Wow.  @cateici tells the Judiciary Committee that she had to hire private security guards to protect her after she received threats for testifying on pro-life issues before the Committee.

According to officials, the fire has burned over 4,400 acres and is 23 percent contained as of Thursday evening.It has now moved-on to the Sierra National Forest, though officials say the lands affected are less than 1 percent of the 1.3 million acre forest. Hundreds of firefighters have been racing against time to contain the blaze, which has threatened  communities and ancient Sequoia trees.The fire was first reported on July 7 and residents of the Wawona community and campers were immediately evacuated. Fire crews used several tactics to protect more than 500 Sequoias in the park’s Mariposa Grove. The flames are being fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions.Crews are tracking the fire from above and using air tanker planes to drop fire-retardant chemicals on the blaze. They are also using bulldozers to create containment lines and wrapping some of the Sequoias with protective foil.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:50 PM PT – Thursday, July 14, 2022Rideshare giant Uber faces a civil suit from more than 550 women who claimed the company failed to place safeguards to protect its customers. On Wednesday, the law firm representing the women said they were kidnapped, sexually assaulted, battered, raped, stalked, harassed and or otherwise attacked by an Uber driver.The suit stems from allegations beginning in 2014 and claimed Uber was aware of the alleged incidents but failed to act putting expansion over rider’s safety. The law firm claimed that Uber overlooked typical background check standards in the interest of more quickly onboarding new drivers.“Uber’s whole business model is predicated on giving people a safe ride home, but rider safety was never their concern, growth was, at the expense of their passenger’s safety,” Adam Slater, founding partner of Slater Slater Schulman said. “While the company has acknowledged this crisis of sexual assault in recent years, its actual response has been slow and inadequate, with horrific consequences.”An Uber spokesperson told Fortune that the company seeks to prioritize passenger safety and takes seriously “every single report” of sexual assault. The newer safety features include the ability for riders to call or text 911 through the Uber app, Ride Check to monitor if a trip has gone off-course or if perhaps a crash has occurred, GPS tracking and background checks on drivers. The company said last year it also started sharing information with its rideshare rival Lyft about drivers who have been deactivated from the platform for safety issues.“There is nothing more important than safety,” the spokesperson said. “Which is why Uber has built new safety features, established survivor-centric policies and been more transparent about serious incidents. While we can’t comment on pending litigation, we will continue to keep safety at the heart of our work.”According to Uber, drivers are vetted through background checks and annual evaluations. Despite that more than 3,800 safety reports were filed in 2019 and 2020.","An Uber sign is displayed inside a car in Palatine, Ill., Thursday, Feb. 10, 2022. (AP Photo/Nam Y.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:00 PM PT – Thursday, July 14, 2022During a hearing on Tuesday, senators from both sides of the aisle heard testimony from healthcare providers about the implications of the Supreme Court’s decision to allow states to implement their own abortion laws. Dr. Kristyn Brandi of Physicians for Reproductive Health told senators that state abortion bans were affecting how physicians treat patients, including withholding critical treatment.“It’s incredibly hard to think about being in that position where I can’t intervene because I have to call my lawyer first to make sure that it’s okay,” Brandi vocalized. “Or that I’m going to wait, wait and wait until somebody gets sicker because I don’t know what that law means. We’re seeing that across the country. I’m hearing stories from all over from physicians that are withholding lifesaving care because they don’t want to go to jail. That’s really not how health care should work.”The end of Roe changed everything. I've met women who have never voted for a Democrat before but are planning to now. We have to fight for every Senate seat in every state – including here in Idaho – to restore abortion rights. #idpol #CodifyRoe— David Roth – Democratic Nominee to U.S. Senate (@rothforIdaho) July 13, 2022Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) described the high court’s ruling as “barbaric.”“About one in 50 pregnancies in our country are ectopic,” Murray voiced. “That means they’re not viable and without medical action they are deadly. In Republican’s post-Roe world, health care providers aren’t sure when or even if they will be able to treat ectopic patients without being sent to prison. Some have already been instructed to observe patients until they have unstable vital signs before acting. Basically, sit on your hands until women are at dire risk before you can do what is medically necessary. That is absolutely barbaric.”Senate GOP just BLOCKED my bill w/ @SenCortezMasto to protect the right to travel—including to get abortion care.

Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) pushed back against her statement. He accused Democrats of using scare tactics and lying to American citizens about state’s who have laws banning abortion.“Myth three, overturning Roe means health care professionals in hospitals cannot treat women with miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies or when the mom’s life is endangered,” Marshall said. “These are all scare tactics preying on the emotions of people. Listen, every state abortion law triggered by overturning Roe includes an exception to save the life of the mother. Treating miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are not the same as performing abortions. In fact, no abortion law in any state in America prevents treatment for women with ectopic pregnancies and or other life-threatening conditions.”Meanwhile, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) played the middle man by saying Congress would have to look at the issue further down the line.“I think we’ve got to look at this again,” Murkowski stated. Again down the road. The balance of power in Congress moves back and forth. Without the filibuster do we really think, do we really believe that a different majority would not seek a nationwide ban on abortion and find a way to succeed in enacting it? The filibuster is really one of the few mechanisms that protects the rights of the minority. I raise this because I think we need to be looking long term at this.”In the meantime, states remain split on their reaction to Roe’s end while the White House is expressing interest in declaring a health emergency to protect access to the procedure.","From left, Illinois Lt.

He acknowledged that a two-state solution will not be a reality anytime soon, but pledged to not give up on pursuing it.“There must be a political horizon the Palestinian people can actually see or at least feel,” Biden said. “We cannot allow the hopelessness to steal away the future that so many have worked toward for so long. So even if the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations, the United States and my administration will not give up on trying to bring the Palestinians and Israelis and both sides closer together.”This comes as the Biden administration announced Thursday that it is providing $316 million in additional aid to the Palestinian authority, including around $200 million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.The administration also proposed a multi-year contribution of $100 million for the East Jerusalem Hospitals Network, which provides medical care ranging from oncological care to emergency services for 50,000 local patients, though the funding would require authorization from Congress.Furthermore, Israelis are in the midst of more political chaos after the government’s collapse last month. The country is headed for its fifth election in under four years and the polls show yet another toss-up. That opens the possibility for a return to power for Benjamin Netanyahu, an antagonist to a peace deal that isn’t lopsided in Israel’s favor.","U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a joint statement with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Friday, July 15, 2022.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:00 PM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) revisited an abortion law in the wake of the overturning of Roe. On Thursday, the top Democrat doubled down on her commitment to federalizing abortion policy throughout all 50 states.“A woman’s right to choose is a kitchen table issue,” Pelosi voiced. “Contraception, birth control — they are kitchen table issues.”House Democrats planned on sending a bill to codify Roe to the Senate whether it is likely to succeed or not. Pelosi proclaimed both congressional Democrats and Joe Biden support enshrining the procedure into national law and that the act is intrinsically American.“This is something that is core to who we are,” she said. “It’s about freedom. It’s about health care. It’s about respect for women and that is something that the president is wedded to.”“Catholic” Nancy Pelosi Nationwide abortion-on-demand is “core to who we are” and about ""freedom"". pic.twitter.com/lZ4GsIQzuv— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 15, 2022Pelosi promised to bring a revamped version of the Women’s Health Protection Act to the House floor, once again. This will codify several aspects of Roe into law. The bill would make abortion access a right, while removing waiting periods and bans which would provide admitting privileges to hospitals to perform the procedure.Critics of the bill have claimed it violates states’ rights as state-level restrictions would be superseded by the new law. The House originally passed the bill, only for the legislation to be shot down in the Senate in a 49 to 51 vote.  However, Pelosi has refused to compromise on the bill’s proposals to vault the 60 vote filibuster threshold.Pelosi has not given up on making Roe the law of the land, even if the bill is stifled in the Senate. The California Democrat pivoted to making an abortion based campaign pitch that encouraged Americans to vote for Democrat candidates nationwide this November.“In fewer than 100 days people will be voting,” she stated. “We have to elect a couple more Democratic senators so that we can get around the filibuster. We have great candidates. Our country is at risk. Our democracy is at risk.”House Democratic women led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emerge on the steps donning green as the chamber prepares to pass (yet again) a bill that would legalize abortion nationwide and ensure women access to travel across state lines to get care pic.twitter.com/hU80KXcToA— Farnoush Amiri (@FarnoushAmiri) July 15, 2022Pelosi has vowed to bring the bill to a vote on the House floor as soon as Friday.","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks at her weekly press conference, Thursday, July 14, 2022, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Suffolk County Police said the fifth shark attack in under two weeks occurred Wednesday evening when a 49-year-old Arizona man was bitten on the left wrist and buttocks while standing waist-deep at Seaview Beach.Beachgoers captured cell phone video of a shark near the shore at field 5 of Robert Moses State Park beach on Sunday5 people on Long Island were bitten by a shark in the last 2 weeks2 alone yesterdayAt least 3 sightings today, including at this same beach @ABC7NY pic.twitter.com/SNEeFPsdqK— Chantee Lans (@ChanteeLans) July 14, 2022He was able to walk out of the water and was taken by helicopter to a local hospital for treatment in stable condition. This just 12 hours after 41-year-old attorney Shawn Donnelly was bitten in the calf by a sand tiger shark while surfing at Smith Point Beach.“It was definitely scary, not going to pretend like it wasn’t,” Donnelly said. “It hit me and knocked me off my board. I saw the fin and I saw the shark.”Shawn Donnelly has been surfing the waters off Long Island for decades. Never even SEEN a shark! Till now. 😬 He will be A-ok! But still…he was bitten yesterday, only 10 yards off shore at Smith Point in Suffolk County.

He was treading water around 200 yards from shore when a small shark approached and nipped his ankle. Mullins was able to make it to shore with only minor injuries.Notice for Smith Point Beach: Swimming has been suspended at this time due to dangerous marine life activity on Wednesday July 13, 2022.— Suffolk County Parks (@SuffolkParks) July 13, 2022Less than a week before another lifeguard was bitten in the chest and hand at the same beach, but escaped after thrashing with the creature near to shore. He returned to work Thursday and said that he’s lucky his injuries weren’t any worse.“I’m just grateful my injuries were minor in comparison to other instances,” voiced lifeguard Zach Gallo. “I think I can pass on some knowledge to fellow lifeguards and younger guards coming up.”The first recent shark encounter occurred three days before this when a 37-year-old swimmer was bitten on his right foot near Jones Beach. Shark deterring efforts, including the deployment of spotter drones and lifeguards on wave runners have been initiated. Authorities have warned beachgoers to only go to protected beaches with lifeguards and avoid going into the water without a partner.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Pelosi: House To Vote On Sweeping Abortion LawTOPICS:beachesbeachgoersincidentslifeguardLong IslandnewsOANOANNoceansharkswimmerwater SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/5-shark-attacks-in-2-weeks-prompt-long-island-beach-closures/

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:15 PM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022Officials retracted their statement claiming a 13-year-old boy was behind the wheel in a crash that killed multiple people in Texas earlier this year. According to a preliminary report issued Thursday, DNA testing found the child’s father was driving the vehicle. Nine people were killed in the head-on collision in March after their pickup truck crashed into a van carrying men’s and women’s golf team members from the University of the Southwest.“A Dodge 2500 pickup was traveling southbound on FM 1788,” the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement. “A Ford Transit passenger van registered to the University of the Southwest in Hobbs, NM was traveling northbound on FM 1788.”One victim was Laci Stone, a freshman member of the women’s golf team who was majoring in global business management, according to a family member. The school identified the other students who died as 19-year-old Mauricio Sanchez, 19-year-old Travis Garcia, 22-year-old Jackson Zinn, 21-year-old Karisa Raines and 18-year-old Tiago Sousa. USW President Quint Thurman also confirmed the death of coach Tyler James.“Last night Laci’s golf team was involved in a crash leaving a golf tournament,” Laci’s mother Chelsi Stone posted on Facebook. “Our sweet Laci didn’t make it. Our Laci is gone! She has been an absolute ray of sunshine during this short time on earth.”The driver and passenger in the pickup truck also died. Investigators were able to identify the remains of the driver by his size. National Transportation Safety Board investigators said they found the presence of methamphetamine in the father’s blood.NEW reversal from NTSB: DNA shows a 13-year-old boy was NOT the driver but *actually a passenger* in the pickup that hit a University of the Southwest golf team van.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:47 PM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022Recently retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is returning to Harvard University to teach. Harvard announced the 83-year-old is re-joining its law school faculty in a statement on Friday, revealing his appointment as Byrne Professor of Administrative Law and Process.The college said Breyer will be teaching seminars and reading groups among other activities. Breyer is a Harvard Law School graduate who first joined the faculty back in 1967 and taught until President Clinton nominated him to the supreme court in 1994.“Justice Breyer is a historic jurist and a world-class legal scholar who also has a distinguished history as a member of this faculty,” Dean John F. Manning said in a statement. “His brilliance, experience, collegiality, openness and intellectual inquisitiveness will deeply enrich our community and advance our mission of teaching, scholarship, and service.”When I took administrative law from Breyer, he was a sweet man who also taught antitrust but was not Areeda. Now, of course, he is a giant — and still a sweet man.  Great news for @Harvard_Law & its students, but also for the American legal system. Hope he will help @FTC, too. https://t.co/WWr3U5ZcRU— Stephen Calkins (@scalkins2) July 15, 2022Breyer announced his retirement last January, clearing the way for President Joe Biden to nominate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to take his seat. Breyer’s retirement from the high court became effective on June 30 after the court released its last opinion in one of the most significant terms in decades. Jackson was sworn in the same day.In his last term, the 83-year-old justice found himself in dissent in cases concerning abortion, gun rights, the environment and religious liberty, as the 6 to 3 conservative leaning court jolted to the right with the addition of three of former President Donald Trump’s nominees. Jackson who was a former clerk to Breyer will not shift the ideological make up of the court, but at 51 years old she is likely to serve for decades.The retired justice said he is very pleased to return to the university.","FILE – Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, appointed by President Bill Clinton, sits with fellow Supreme Court justices for a group portrait at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, Nov. 30, 2018.
