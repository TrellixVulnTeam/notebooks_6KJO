2022-07-28,6:25 AM PT,GDP report signals America in recession,"The looming GDP report has been released and shows another contraction in the second quarter. The Bureau of Economic Statistics revealed the national GDP shrank by 0.9 percent. This marks the second straight quarter of decline, further fueling fears of a recession.The news comes on the heels of the Federal Reserve’s move Wednesday to hike interest rates for the fourth time this year, which is the second consecutive increase of 0.75 percent, in an attempt to combat inflation. In the month of June, Inflation hit 9.1 percent, which is the fastest increase in prices in 40 years.America’s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is denying assessments that an economic downturn has hit the US. In a statement Wednesday, he said unemployment is low and the labor market is strong. Powell added, “it doesn’t make sense” that the US economy would be in a recession at this point.“I don’t agree at all, I think it’s really hard to argue we’re not in a recession given the fact that, for instance, just one indicator,” stated Scott Minerd, Chief Investment Officer at Guggenheim Global. “The leading economic indicator that four down prints in a row in on a monthly basis, every time that’s ever happened that is essentially a signal that we are in or we are about to enter a recession.”However, Powell claimed consumer demand is still strong and the US economy will grow this year, despite data suggesting US households are pulling back on purchases amid runaway inflation. Despite Powell’s stance, economists have pointed out a second negative quarter in a row would mean America is already in a recession.Economists at Saxo Bank said the US will face higher inflation for an extended period of time because the White House and the Federal Reserve don’t have enough policy choices. In their new analysis, Saxo economists concluded rising federal interest rates will increase US unemployment while rising prices will continue to hurt consumers.Experts believe energy prices will continue to rise due to political risks. Saxo analysts also said it’s unrealistic to expect inflation to peak in December because that’s when the energy crisis will become worse due to higher. Meanwhile, inflation is unlikely to “peak” anytime soon and it turns out it’s not “transitory” after all, which is contrary to White House claims.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food prices are up 10.4 percent and the pain at pump has become more severe as gas prices increased by nearly 60 percent over the last year. As prices surge, so are the lines at food banks across the country.“What we’re hearing from people and families is they’re making these decisions between filling their gas tank to get to work, paying the rent, paying utilities, other basic expenses and meeting their food costs,” explained Michael Flood, CEO of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.Food banks are struggling to meet growing demand as more working Americans grapple with inflation and struggle with feeding their families. Flood said people are looking to pantries and distribution programs just “to try to make ends meet.”Vanessa Correa, left, and Gigi Fiske, right, pass out gallons of milk at a food distribution held by the Farm Share food bank, Wednesday, July 20, 2022, in Miami. Long lines are back at food banks around the U.S. as working Americans overwhelmed by inflation turn to handouts to help feed their families. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)Chief Investment Officer Cresset Capital, Jack Ablin explained that the more persistent inflation is, the more aggressive the Federal Reserve has to be. His comments came ahead of the release of the second quarter GDP report. Economists have pointed out a second negative quarter in a row would mean America is already in a recession.The Biden White House has continued to avoid responsibility for the economic crisis facing the country. During a recent press conference, Economic Adviser Brian Deese suggested Americans shouldn’t complain about inflation as they could be worse off like other countries facing famine. He went on to say that despite inflation hitting a record high in June, the economy is “resilient to the challenges” nation is facing.“So it’s our view that inflation is the top economic priority that we need to be focused on as a country,” he stated. “And it is our view that if we move out more quickly and more aggressively on the types of steps that the President has outlined, then we are going to move more quickly to helping to bring prices down.”Deese is not the first White House official to ignore or alter the definition of a recession while trying to downplay the severity of the pain Americans are feeling in their pocketbooks. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also appeared to sidestep recession fears.Doocy: ""If things are going so great, why are White House officials are redefining recession?""Jean-Pierre: ""We are not.""Doocy: ""It's two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth… How is that not redefining recession?""Jean-Pierre: ""That's not the definition."" pic.twitter.com/eyyvYdZWMj— Greg Price (@greg_price11) July 27, 2022","FILE – An American flag adorns the facade of the New York Stock Exchange on June 29, 2022, in New York.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:37 AM PT – Thursday, July 28, 2022The Senate passed the multi-billion dollar CHIPS Act in a bipartisan vote aimed at growing America’s semiconductor industry. In a 64-to-33 decision Wednesday, the upper chamber approved the bill, which would give $52 billion to companies that produce semi-conductor chips.The proposal also offers a tax credit to encourage those companies to boost production in the US. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) asserted that American companies will need government assistance to keep up with foreign competitors. Meanwhile, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) highlighted the legislation as a response to China’s assertive position in the semi-conductor market.'Bad Day For President Xi And CCP': Cornyn Applauds Investments In Semic… https://t.co/CTuvwR1qR5 via @YouTube— Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) July 28, 2022Seventy-five percent of the world’s semi-conductors are produced in East Asia with 90 percent of the world’s most advanced semi-conductors being manufactured in Taiwan. If China were to seize the island, which it believes is a territory of the People’s Republic, the US would be dependent on its greatest geopolitical rival for crucial technological components.A number of senators, however, accused the bill proponents of using a foreign policy crisis to line the pockets of large corporations. In addition to the $52 billion in subsidies, the legislation allows for an additional $24 billion in tax incentives and provisions as well as nearly $170 billion to fund technology and research over the next five years.When accounting for all the bill’s provisions, its total price tag comes out to $280 billion. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) called the legislation highly irresponsible, while asserting Congress is fueling inflation by blowing out spending when there is “more than enough money sloshing around in the economy.”Additionally, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) berated the upper chamber for writing a blank check to the microchip industry at the expense of the American public. Sanders pointed to corporate interests rather than the “China threat” as the inspiration for the CHIPS Act.﻿Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) also chimed in to proclaim many of the subsidies’ recipients may use American dollars to manufacture the products abroad. Nonetheless, the bill is now headed to the House of Representatives, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) expects the proposal to pass.My statement on the CHIPS Act: pic.twitter.com/AlbHa7FFjo— Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) July 27, 2022 ","FILE – The inside of a computer is seen on Feb 23, 2019, in Jersey City, N.J.

According to reports, an SUV carrying more than 25 people collided into a utility pole in Santa Teresa, New Mexico on Wednesday.“Upon arrival, the Sunland Park Fire Department observed approximately 11 to 12 passengers in the vehicle,” recounted Chief Daniel Medrano, Unland Park Fire Department. “One was transported critical condition by Native Air to UMC (University Medical Center of El Paso).

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:13 AM PT – Wednesday, July 27, 2022The Vice President continued her pro-abortion crusade in the Hoosier state on Tuesday. Kamala Harris highlighted the effects overturning Roe v. Wade has had on disabled Americans.She held the round table on the 32nd anniversary of the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. While celebrating the importance of the legislation, Harris warned the repeal of federal abortions could be a cause of concern for those with disabilities.“So, we have convened knowing that the ADA was signed into law to protect the rights of Americans with disabilities,” she stated. “And with the recent Dobbs decision by the United States Supreme Court, I have particular concerns about how that decision will uniquely impact Americans with disabilities.”President Joe Biden’s border czar went on to chastise Republicans for passing pro-life laws, which she claimed disproportionately affects her audience.“But these abortion restrictions that are being put in place around our country by extremist, so-called leaders in various states, will have a disproportionate impact on people with disabilities,” Harris stated. “People with disabilities have higher rates of pregnancy complications.”Harris lamented those with intellectual or developmental disabilities are at a higher risk of missing the windows many states have set to receive the procedure. In order to ensure equitable access to abortions, she emphasized people with disabilities should be at the very center of discussions to resurrect Roe. Harris went on to declare abortion is integral to the very concept of freedom.“And Dobbs did so much that is going to undo the fair spirit of that principle, which is the spirit of all people have been entitled to self determination,” the Vice President continued.Unfortunately, the viral moment the event was Harris’ introduction as she began the meeting by announcing her pronouns. Several critics, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), expressed their shock that Harris would invoke the word woman as Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson said she could not define it.But what is a woman? https://t.co/nN6aIgJ2pf— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) July 26, 2022Furthermore, Rep.

(Department of Energy via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:30 AM PT – Wednesday, July 27, 2022The Biden administration is releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after a failed effort to increase supply from Saudi Arabia. In a statement Tuesday, the White House said the Department of Energy would sell another 20 million barrels of oil from the reserves to stabilize the gas market.President Joe Biden’s officials also pointed out gas prices have continued to fall. These sentiments came despite economists saying gas prices are falling because of concerns of recession, while most of SPR oil has been exported to Europe and China. This comes as natural gas prices in Europe are hitting new record highs as a result of anti-Russian sanctions.“The most crucial outcome is that we will start saving gas now and that we have a blueprint to act together in a coordinated way if the situation worsens,” said EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson. “Reducing gas demand proactively allows us to avoid rushed or unilateral decisions when it is too late. It will make it possible to plan the savings in the most efficient way.” 💠It is extremely important to explain our new “Save gas for a safe winter” package together with European Gas Demand Reduction Plan to the general public. 💠We need their support & everyone can do their part. pic.twitter.com/smIgsQuYey— Kadri Simson (@KadriSimson) July 21, 2022A number of European countries have already asked Biden for more oil and gas going into the winter season amid fears that Russia may shut off the supply.","An undated photo provided by the Department of Energy shows crude oil pipes at the Bryan Mound site near Freeport, Texas.

Among those attending the ceremony was Kansas Senator Roger Marshall (R) who expressed enthusiasm that the statue has been added to the Capitol’s statuary hall.“It was great to share this moment, the unveiling of Amelia’s statue with the people who had been working for two decades on this,” said Marshall. “I got to spend several days there with this community and they’re just so proud. This icon from Kansas, a woman pilot in the 1930’s and not just a woman pilot but a great aviator who broke many records that knew no bounds to how high she could go or how fast she goes. It was a very emotional day for all of us.”I want to thank our Congressional leaders and our Kansas delegation for the opportunity to honor one of Kansas’ most iconic figures – Amelia Earhart – a woman who showed us what it means to reach for the stars. This statue will serve as an inspiration for generations to come. pic.twitter.com/PFfDOXsHGN— Governor Laura Kelly (@GovLauraKelly) July 27, 2022Senator Jerry Moran (R) emphasized how Earhart’s upbringing in his home state of Kansas helped blossom her aviation career.“Amelia’s ambition and spirit of adventure that took her around the world was built on a foundational upbringing in Atchison,” Moran voiced. “It is fitting today that the foundation on which she stands is from limestone from the flint hills of Kansas.”Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) expressed hope that Earhart’s legacy would inspire America’s youth to reach for great things.“I look forward to looking over to this corner,” uttered McCarthy. “I’m sure we’ll watch a lot of young women taking a picture and I wonder what new frontiers will be inspired by Amelia Earhart and what more boundaries will be broken. What new balance will come out of the world. from a little corner in a capital of her dreams, still living in boundaries unfold of what could be broken.”The ceremony was held on the 90th anniversary of her historic flight across the Atlantic and what would have been her 125th birthday.","Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, center, is joined by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., center left, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., far left, former Kansas Sen.

A ceremony was held Wednesday to reveal the Wall of Remembrance near the Lincoln Memorial, a granite wall inscribed with the names of those who lost their lives in the war.The wall features the names of more than 43,000 service members who lost their lives defending the nation and the people of South Korea. The names include over 36,000 American service members plus over 7,000 members of the Korean augmentation to the United States Army who fought alongside US troops.Good morning from the Korean War Veterans Memorial.

On Tuesday, family members of Korean War Veterans got the first chance to see their relatives names engraved in stone.“They always call the Korean War the forgotten war and I think this helps to dispel some of that,”  Doug Emhoff voiced. “Now with the names here people can come and visit and see their loved ones or even if they were not the family members but people that they knew. So, I think it’s a strong message.The sloped wall was built to surround The Pool of Remembrance and reaffirms the memorial’s message “freedom is not free.”","A bouquet rests on a section of the Korean War Veterans Memorial’s newly unveiled Wall of Remembrance, Wednesday, July 27, 2022, in Washington.

Steve Scalise, R.La., speaks during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, July 19, 2022. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:33 PM PT – Thursday, July 28, 2022Americans are facing pain at the pump, rising consumer prices, increased crime rates and an open border. These are all issues covered by House Republicans at a recent press conference while presenting their plan moving into the coming summer recess.Committee Vice Chair Mike Johnson (R-La.) highlighted the mistakes made by the Biden administration while illustrating that they are focused on the wrong things.“Well they are taking guns from law-abiding citizens, they are dishing out corporate welfare and yet another tax and spend reconciliation bill,” he listed. “The Democrat agenda alternates between attempts to distract the American people at best and outright misguided policy at worst.”Johnson continued by stating what the Republicans believe are the three I’s of the coming election: inflation, immigration and incompetence.“Of course, many expect that the update tomorrow will confirm what we seem to feel and know intuitively — that we’ve officially entered a recession,” said the GOP lawmaker. “And instead of working to keep our economy out of recession, the White House is busy in itself trying to redefine what that term means.”Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) continued by reaffirming the dangers of the Democrats’ Build Back Better bill, asserting it will only reduce costs of drugs by limiting production which will ultimately slow research and development of cures and treatments for disease. He affirmed the solution to this is the bipartisan House Resolution 19, which will lower costs and increase transparency.“And one of the worst parts about this bill, if you’re someone like most Americans that pays into Medicare your whole life, this bill is robbing Medicare to get go ahead and pay for insurance premiums,” explained the Ohio lawmaker. “The money that is saved is going to insurance companies, not even targeted for care.”Closing out the conference, Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) doubled down that we have already reached a recession and that the Biden administration is merely in denial.“We’re seeing denial and what you’ve seen in the last week is President Biden spending more time trying to redefine what inflation and a recession rather than working to lay out a plan to stop us from going into a recession,” he stated.Scalise said the only way to escape the current recession is to reverse the failed policies that led to it, but the first step to ending any crisis is to admit that there is one.","House Minority Whip Rep.

According to congressional testimony from the Acting Director of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last year, cartels are becoming more profitable as they have teams have teams specializing in logistics, transportation, surveillance, stash houses and accounting.During the America First Agenda Summit Tuesday, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) noted the estimates cartels are making on a regional level.

Five libel lawsuits brought by Sandmann were dismissed Wednesday after the judge ruled reports of the incident by the New York Times CBS, ABC, Gannett and Rolling Stone are protected speech.Sandmann was just 16-years-old when his interaction with a chanting Native American activist blew up online. The teenager was wearing a MAGA hat which resulted in extreme hate from most major media outlets. Sandmann has previously received settlements from NBC, CNN and the Washington Post.Several mainstream media outlets portrayed the video as racially charged with Sandmann antagonizing Phillips by standing in front of him and smiling. However, additional footage later showed that their confrontation was provoked by a group of Black Hebrew Israelites who hurled racial slurs at him and his fellow students. Phillips was later seen approaching Sandmann as tension rose between the students and the Black Hebrew Israelites.The case came at a time of widespread racial tension, but the judge said his decisions were made “with no consideration of the rancorous political debate associated with these cases.”Thread:  Obviously, the ruling yesterday was a disappointment for my family and I. I’m appealing the decision in the sixth circuit. Here’s why:— Nicholas Sandmann (@N1ckSandmann) July 28, 2022He said on Twitter he feels disappointed by the ruling and hopes to file an appeal.","OAN Newsroom
