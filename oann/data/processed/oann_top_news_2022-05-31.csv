9:19 AM PT",Memorial Day Travel: Millions plan trips despite record high gas prices,"The record-high gas prices are hitting hard ahead of the Memorial Day weekend with analysts predictoing an 8 percent increase in travel compared to 2021. AAA estimated that more than 39.2 million people will travel for this Memorial Day holiday period with the majority of travel expected to be by car.Gas prices throw a wrench into vacation plans: Families prepare for 'costly' 2022 travel https://t.co/XCusyP0DsX via @usatoday— AAA Travel (@AAA_Travel) March 25, 2022According to AAA, as of Thursday, nearly every state is seeing an average price of more than $4 per gallon. However, many everyday Americans, like Dan Johnson of Pennsylvania, have plans they can’t miss.“My wife’s family, her sister is graduating from Tufts University in Boston, so we really didn’t have a choice and we just toughed it up,” Johnson explaned. “And you know, whatever the gas price is, we unfortunately just have to pay for it. But, you know, we want to go visit our family, so this is the cost that’s involved.”Good luck with gas prices this Memorial Day weekend.— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) May 27, 2022The spike in fuel costs is likely due to the cost of crude oil and President Joe Biden’s multiple energy policy failures. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) spoke on the issues at hand ahead of the big travel holiday.“As you travel this Memorial Day weekend, think about how much more it’s costing you to fill up your car,” he noted. “Then remember that restricting the supply and raising the price of American energy is a premeditated part of the Democrats’ radical agenda.”Gas prices are 51% higher than last Memorial Day weekend, and 135% higher than during Memorial Day weekend in 2020.— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) May 27, 2022It appears there is no end in sight for record-high fuel prices as the pain at the pump continues for Americans. Many people may end up reconsidering summer vacations with rising inflation and lack of solutions coming from Biden’s White House.","High gas prices are shown in Los Angeles, Tuesday, May 24, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:05 AM PT – Friday, May 27, 2022A small community in Texas is mourning following the deadly mass shooting at a school. At least 19 students and two adults were killed when a gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, which is located West of San Antonio. Officials from the local school district said their hearts are broken and their thoughts as well as their prayers are with all the families affected by the tragedy. They also said grief counseling and support will be available for students, staff and community members.This comes as investigators are trying to determine a motive in the shooting after suspect Salvador Ramos, 18, opened fire at the school. According to authorities, he acted alone and shot dead by responding police officers. The gunman reportedly purchased a pair of rifles along with 375 rounds of ammunition at a local sporting goods store back in March.Texas Governor Gregg Abbott (R) has provided more insight into what led up to Tuesday’s mass school shooting. In a press conference Wednesday, he said the 18-year-old gunman was reportedly a high school drop out who may have had a juvenile record.Provided an update today on the ongoing response to the horrific tragedy at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.

The governor credited law enforcement for quickly arriving to the scene and running toward gunfire to prevent further loss of life.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed their condolences for the families who lost loved ones in Texas. On Tuesday, nearly every legislator took to social to send out sympathies following the mass shooting.President Joe Biden also addressed the nation following the tragic shooting. He commented about how had previously spoken following the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting while noting there have been over 900 reported incidents of gunfire on school grounds since that incident.“Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen?” Biden asked. “Where in God’s name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with it? It’s time to turn this pain into action.”Meanwhile, the shooting remains under investigation as police try to determine the motive behind the massacre. On Wednesday, police revealed all 21 victims, 19 students and two teachers, were in the same fourth grade classroom when the gunman entered and opened fire.Officials with the Texas Department of Public Health and Safety said they are looking to everything from who this gunman was to why he committed such an awful crime.

Here’s the timeline of what they say happened:11:28 a.m. — The suspect wrecked his truck, which he had stolen from his grandmother after shooting her in the face, outside of the school. He jumped out the passenger side and retrieves what was found out to be ammunition. He sees two women outside of the nearby funeral home and begins shooting at them. The suspect then jumped the fence, which placed him in the school parking lot. He then appears to already shoot at the building.11:40 — The suspect makes his way into Robb Elementary School. According to video, he discharges dozens of rounds once inside. At about that same time, he walks into a classroom. Officers are at the scene, but they don’t enter or return fire because of the initial shots. However, they are calling for backup. At the same time, officers are evacuating the school. Then the incident turned into a rescue operation. It was reported that a school district police officer approached the gunman, however, the rangers said that was not true. The suspect faced no obstacle between his grandmothers home and the school.Officials from the Department of Public Safety said they will provide more updates as they come.","A family pays their respects next to crosses bearing the names of Tuesday’s shooting victims at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, Thursday, May 26, 2022.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:27 PM PT – Thursday, May 26, 2022Several Florida residents were honored for their life saving actions to help land a small plane after the pilot suffered a medical emergency. On Thursday, the group was acknowledged by Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center during a news conference. The group included air traffic controllers, medical doctors and passengers of the plane.Pilot Kenneth Allen was able to share his side of the story for the first time. The 64-year-old pilot recalled the moment he lost consciousness while flying ten thousand feet above the Florida coast on May 10, in turn, forcing a passenger with no flying experience to take control of the plane.“I remember telling Russ and Daren that I didn’t feel well,” Allen recalled. “My head was pounding and I was seeing little blue lights sparkling through here. They asked me what that means and I said I don’t know, I have a really bad headache. Then I remember them poking me on the side of the arm saying “stay with me, stay with me.” That was it, I can’t really recall anything until my guys over here were pulling me out of the airplane.”After Allen passed out, the passenger later, identified as Lakeland resident Darren Harrison, can be heard telling the air traffic controller he was not an experienced pilot and that he could tell he was facing the coast.“I’ve got a serious situation here,” Harrison said. “My pilot has gone incoherent. I have no idea how to fly the airplane.”Harrison took control of the plane and managed to land at the Palm Beach International Airport with the help of Air Traffic Control.“I knew if I didn’t react that we would die,” he stated. “I reached over his body because at this point he’s unresponsive. I grabbed the controls of the airplane and slowly started to pull back on the stick and turn.”Both Harrison and the other passenger credited Air Traffic Controller Robert Morgan for safely guiding them to the landing strip. Allen reportedly suffered a torn aorta during the incident, a typically catastrophic injury, which the Doctor’s who treated him asserted could have just as easily ended his life. Less than a week after the operation, Allen was up and about.","FORT LAUDERDALE, FL – JULY 14: A Delta airlines plane is seen as it comes in for a landing at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on July 14, 2016 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:29 AM PT – Friday, May 27, 2022Senate Republicans blocked a domestic terrorism bill while asserting it would dangerously expand the government’s surveillance powers. On Thursday, the measure failed along party lines. At least 10 Republican votes were needed to advance.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced the bill in response to a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo. It would have created new federal offices to increase focus on domestic terrorism threats in coordination with Homeland Security, the DOJ and the FBI.Republicans have been skeptical of the legislation. They believe the bill could lead to the policing of political speech and claimed it’s an updated version of the Patriot Act to surveil Americans. Democrats have tied the issue to firearms and are pushing for gun control, while echoing calls for the measures approval following the massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called the bill an insult to every police officer in the country.“This is a filtration of the uniformed services and federal law enforcement,” Paul said. “This is not just an insult to your local police or to the marines, to the army, to the navy, his is an insult to the FBI, its an insult to the capital police. This bill says that they’ve been infiltrated. This says that our police are consumed with some kind of race rage. It’s untrue, it’s slander, it’s scandalous.”The bill was not expected to pass after it received GOP support in the House. It only gained one Republican vote from Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) slammed Republicans in his push to get the bill passed.“Many Republicans have made their opposition clear,” stated Schumer. “There are a lot of MAGA Republicans for whom no amount of gun violence, whether it’s domestic terrorism, a school shooting, a neighborhood shooting or something else, will ever, ever convince them to take any action.”Today, the Senate is voting on the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to help combat a serious cause of gun violence:Domestic terrorism and white supremacyIt will give the government the tools to monitor, find, & arrest evil actors before they have a chance to inflict violence— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) May 26, 2022Schumer voiced he will hold bipartisan negotiations in the Senate in the coming weeks to try and hammer out a compromised bill.","Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., looks over his notes before speaking to reporters at a news conference following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 24, 2022.
