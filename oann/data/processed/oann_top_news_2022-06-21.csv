Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has previously stressed anyone threatening violence outside a judge’s home must be charged with a federal crime.“They should enforce federal law because there is a law that explicitly prohibits protesting at the homes of justices, jurors or prosecutors,” said Cotton. “Joe Biden should go out and say law enforcement will put an end to it tonight. If any person gets close to a justices home they should be charged with a federal crime.”As protests have intensified, the Senate passed legislation to boost security for the justices. The Supreme Court Police Party Act is expected to provide details similar to those given to members of Congress and White House officials. Nonetheless, protesters have suggested this won’t be the last time they demonstrate outside the home of a Supreme Court justice.","U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett speaks with Board of Trustees Chairman Frederick J.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:32 PM PT – Sunday, June 19 2022President Joe Biden praised the CDC’s decision to authorize Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for younger children. In a statement Saturday, Biden called the move a “monumental step.”“For parents all over the country, this is a day of relief and celebration,” he said.This comes after the FDA authorized the vaccines for children as young as six-months-old. Children will receive a two dose regimen for the Moderna vaccine and will be given three doses under the Pfizer vaccine. Biden said parents will be able to schedule vaccine appointments starting this week.“As the first country to protect our youngest children with COVID-19 vaccines, my administration has been planning and preparing for this moment for months,” the president voiced. “Effectively securing doses and offering safe and highly effective mRNA vaccines for all children as young as six-months- old.”Good news, folks: Vaccines for kids under 5 have now been authorized by the FDA and recommended by the CDC.For the first time, virtually every American can access the protections from these lifesaving vaccines – from our youngest to our most senior Americans.— President Biden (@POTUS) June 18, 2022Meanwhile, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb predicted a slow coronavirus vaccine rollout for kids. During an interview on CBS Face the Nation Sunday, Gottlieb said only 30 percent of kids ages five to 11 have received two doses of the vaccine.” I think it’s gonna be more of a slow roll out, relevant to what we’ve seen in past rollouts with other age groups,” Gottlieb stated. “There are going to be pharmacy’s that are giving vaccines. CVS is going to move it into their pharmacy’s, but their only moving it into the pharmacy’s with advanced care providers.”Gottlieb believes the vaccine doesn’t ensure complete safety from the sickness, but will increase the baseline immunity against infection. A recent Keiser Family Foundation survey found just 18 percent of parents were eager to get their kids vaccinated. The current Pfizer board member predicts those numbers may be even lower.","FILE – In this Sept. 14, 2021, file photo, a health worker administers a dose of a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine during a vaccination clinic in Reading, Pa.

(Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:53 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022The messaging seems to be clear among economists within the Biden administration: don’t say recession. They appear to be reluctant to say a recession is looming, despite warning the economy is likely to slow down.Several of Biden’s economists were scattered around on several corporate news outlets, where they asserted inflation will likely “not come down to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target” and the US economy will “slow down” yet a recession is “not inevitable.”Together, we've made extraordinary progress in laying a new foundation for our economy. But there's still so much at stake. pic.twitter.com/0hcrgpdTGs— President Biden (@POTUS) June 20, 2022President of the Cleveland Fed, Loretta Mester said she agreed with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that the Central Bank cannot do much more than it already has done. Powell announced last week that the Fed is going to hike the interest rate by 75 basis points, which is 50 percent more than they originally planned.Mester asserted, this will aim to moderate demand for goods and services, so that it can get back in balance with the supply side of the economy. However, she went on to blame external factors for high prices of gas, while pointing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“Of course there are other things going on as well,” said Mester. The Ukraine situation which is a tragedy has really led to the prices. Other things were moving on the supply side as well. No doubt, supply conditions remain constrained longer than I think anyone thought.”Meanwhile, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen echoed the administration’s talking point that the economy under Biden was booming until it suddenly went bust. Yellen claimed the labor market is the strongest in decades, despite record number of people quitting their jobs. She also blamed Russia for America’s high energy and food prices. She stressed, the only way to manage the economic crises is to submit to Biden’s climate agenda.“I think that producers were partly caught unaware by the strength of the recovery in the economy and weren’t ready to meet the needs of the economy,” Yellen expressed. “High prices should induce them to increase supplies over time and look at some medium term matter. The way in which we can assure reasonable energy expenses for household is to move to renewables, to address climate change. That’s the way to free us from GO political movements and gas prices.”Additionally, Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese downplayed the negative impacts of Biden’s economic policies. He noted the long discredited practice of calling the sky high inflation rates as “transitory” and also tried to say there are immensely positive things Biden has done.“We need to navigate through this transition in a way that gets us to stable growth without giving up on all the economic gains that we’ve made,” expressed Deese.However, former the US Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, said a recession is in fact on the horizon. Many experts have credited Summers as one of the most prophetic critics who accurately predicted the economic crises coming into fruition. He asserted that record inflation, food and energy prices are all signs that point to a recession. The former top economist said there are several things the government can do to pullout of the economic crisis.“If at long last we can have some kind of bipartisan budget bill with three elements,” stated Summers. “Reduction of pharmaceutical prices put in place, the partial repeal of the Trump tax cuts and more energy supply approach.” In the meantime, the Fed is gearing up to unleash another massive interest rate hike if the inflation rate that will continue to soar. Critics of the Biden administration have urged officials to stop playing the blame game and work towards fixing their mistakes.Several polls have shown American voters are looking to make a change in the midterm elections.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:23 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022Staffing issues forced American Airlines to cut service to three US cities. Beginning September 7, American will no longer offer service to Toledo, Ohio, Ithaca, New York and Islip, New York. This due to pilot shortages.“In response to the regional pilot shortage affecting the airline industry, American Airlines has made the difficult decision to end service,” American Airlines spokeswoman Andrea Koos said in a statement. “We’re extremely grateful for the care and service our team members provided to our customers in Islip, Ithaca and Toledo and are working closely with them during this time.”The decision came on the heels of thousands of flight cancellations and delays in recent months. More and more people are traveling for the first time since the pandemic, putting a strain on the industry. The airline also said they are making changes to eight other routes, which they claim will better match the current demand environment.“The new PSA agreements will not only help PSA hire and retain quality pilots, but will set the standard for other regional carriers to follow suit,” John Ebbert, chair of the ALPA’s PSA pilot group stated.Multiple airlines have begun to cut flights from their daily schedule. Delta Airlines cut 100 flights between July 1 and August 7. Southwest Airlines cut 20,00 flights.Large numbers of Americans are taking trips for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:30 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022A top House Democrat is already making contingency plans for if President Joe Biden decides not to run in 2024 elections. Speaking on CNN on Monday, House Democrat Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said his number one choice to replace Biden on the Democrat ticket would be his Border Czar Kamala Harris. He went on to backpedal his position and claimed “a Biden presidency is what America needs right now.”“You know, there’s no question in my mind that Joe Biden is doing exactly what needs to be done for this great country of ours,” Clyburn replied. “We all know that our Democracy is teetering on edge. We need a Joe Biden to get us through this rough patch and I think he’s doing great with that. We know that his forecast includes Vice President Harris. I support her. I’m just saying that if he chooses not to run again, first on my list after him would be Kamala Harris.”This comes amid reports that Democrats are increasingly skeptical of a possible Biden run in 2024, as he has vowed to run again. Democrats are also expected to lose in this year’s midterms. American’s have began  to decry Biden’s handling of the economy, foreign policy and the social issues facing of America.“I think a lot depends upon what the issues are after the midterm elections,” he explained. “What kind of impact his policies will have on the outcome of that election and I think that he will make a decision based upon that. I think that Democratic voters will be doing that as well. Everybody knows that none of us are getting any younger. We all tend to adjust our activities based upon what time it is at any given juncture. He’ll do the same.”However, Clyburn did admit that Biden is at an advanced age and he may not be up for a second term.","Chairman Rep.

Sen. candidate Katie Britt touts America First agendaFILE – Republican U.S. Senate candidate Katie Britt talks to supporters during her watch party on May 24, 2022, in Montgomery, Ala. (Photo/Butch Dill, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:03 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022Trump-endorsed Katie Britt (R) made her final plea to voters. She made her case for why she is the best candidate to serve as US Senate seat in Alabama and aimed to take on Washington elites. As she spoke to Breitbart News, the Trump-backed candidate stressed she will fight for the hardworking people of the Cotton State.Britt said she has shifted along with Republican voters from a party run by big business to a party run by the people. She lamented, people in Washington don’t get the struggles of the average American.“I think these career politicians just don’t get it anymore,” expressed Britt. They’ve been there too long and they just don’t understand what hard working people are going through. People cannot afford gas. We must become not only energy independent, but energy dominant. Every dollar the government spends, the dollar in our pocket is worthless.”Britt went on to vow to bring back several America First policies, especially when it comes to securing the southern border. She said President Joe Biden’s failed foreign policies in countries, including Afghanistan are exacerbating the migrant crisis and are radicalizing terrorists who are illegally entering the US. Additionally, Britt said she will work to pass legislation that aims to reduce immigration and create a merit based system for foreigners to become American citizens.“You can go all the way back to Ted Kennedy’s 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act,” she voiced. You see the shift that occurred there and it wasn’t for the better. We’ve got to stand up for hard working Alabamians and Americans. We got to end the chain migration system and create an actual merit based immigration system. We’ve got to find a way to increase wages so that people can provide for their family and have a pathway to success.”Meanwhile, several Republicans have backed Britt’s bid for Senate in favor of her primary opponent and current Congressman Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). Trump unendorsed Brooks earlier this year over the Representative’s lackluster stance on election integrity and lambasted him for having no loyalties but to himself.However, after Britt got the “Trump bump” she received glowing endorsements from high profile Republicans, including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C) and Trump’s former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Several America First candidates, including Adam Laxalt (R) in Nevada, Doug Mastriano (R) in Pennsylvania and JD Vance (R) in Ohio, won in their primaries and are headed to the November general election. Britt hopes this new band of America First patriots will coalesce to make America great again.TOMORROW IS THE DAYRemind your family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors to get out the vote on Tuesday!Alabama’s future is on the ballot, and I’d be honored to earn your vote. pic.twitter.com/6KJBv6Zfi6— Katie Britt for AL (@KatieBrittforAL) June 20, 2022The runoff election between Britt and Brooks is expected to take place Tuesday.","FILE – Republican U.S. Senate candidate Katie Britt talks to supporters during her watch party on May 24, 2022, in Montgomery, Ala.
