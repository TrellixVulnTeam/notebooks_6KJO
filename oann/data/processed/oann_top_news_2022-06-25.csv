8:37 AM PT",Chicago guns matter founder praises Supreme Court decision on N.Y. gun law,"A gun activist in Chicago praised the Supreme Court’s ruling on a New York law, which restricted the carrying of handguns in public. While speaking to reporters on Thursday, Rhonda Ezell, the founder of the organization Chicago Guns Matter, spoke about the impact the court’s decision will have on gun rights.Ezell founded the organization after she won an appeal in her federal lawsuit against Chicago over the city’s ban on gun ranges. Prior to this, the Supreme Court struck down New York’s conceal carry law in a six to three decision.“This means a lot because our rights have been trampled out for decades,” said Ezell. “Even up to this day, they were still trying to impose more racist gun control measures that does nothing to stop the violence. All they want to do is disarm America for their little utopia of socialism and communism. In this case, here put a stamp onto that, it’s not going to happen and that they have to respect what the Second Amendment is.”The Second Amendment advocate then went on to describe how she felt about her court victory being referenced during the justice’s deliberation.“So, for our cases to be cited in this New York state rifle and pistol case, it means a lot to me as much as it does to anyone else in this country,” she noted.  “But it’s for everyone, it’s for all of us, because it’s going to set a precedent across this nation that we are not standing for tyranny from the political powers that be.”In the meantime, Ezell spoke about what she has in store for the future of Chicago Guns Matter.“I’m looking for someone to invest and bring a gun range in the city of Chicago, so that we can further educate the Black community — any community, all communities — because we want to get over the stigma of it’s taboo when you talk about firearm ownership in the Black community,” she continued.To everyone that likes to talk down on Chicago, today would be a great day to honor the work we've put forth in fighting to keep our freedoms in this country.Real Talk. https://t.co/3XzVYYnCbK— Ms. Ezell (@ms_ezell) June 23, 2022Meanwhile, the Senate passed a bipartisan gun control bill, which incentivizes funding for state red flag laws.

As the challenges confronting Biden intensify, his predictions of a rosy political future for the Democratic Party are growing bolder. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:44 PM PT – Thursday, June 23 2022The Biden administration struggled to convince consumers that they’re really attempting to bring down gas prices. On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris claimed officials were working to get gas prices under control.“Let me just tell you that the president and I, and our administration, is absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to bring down the cost of gas at the pump,” voiced Harris. However, President Joe Biden does not seem to be quite as optimistic.“The idea we’re going to be able to click a switch and bring down the cost of gasoline is not likely in the near term,” said Biden.Critics recently mocked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre for saying Biden is doing what he can to “alleviate” gas prices.“The President has been very clear in making sure that he does everything he can to alleviate the pain that American families are feeling when it comes to gas prices,” the secretary expressed.Despite this, the White House said they’re going to suspend the federal gas tax for 90 days in an effort to help consumers, which will allow families to feel a little bit of relief. A whole 18 cents per gallon of gas. However, critics have derided the move as they state even former President Barack Obama criticized the idea of a gas tax holiday during his presidential campaign in 2008, calling it a “gimmick” at the time.“For us to suggest that 30 cents a day, for 3 months is real relief, that that’s a real energy policy,” stated Obama. “It means that we are not tackling the problem that has to be tackled.”Additionally, Biden has called on states to provide relief to consumers by suspending the state gas tax, while continuing to blame the conflict in Ukraine for high gas prices and inflation. According to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Ukraine is not the driving force behind rising inflation.“Given how inflation has escalated over the past 18 months, would you say that the word Ukraine is the primary driver of inflation in America,?” questioned Powell. “No, inflation was high certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out. I’m glad to hear you say that the Biden administration seems to be intent on deflecting blame and recently this past Sunday spread the misinformation that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is the biggest single driver of inflation. I’m glad that you agree with me that’s not the truth.”Critics said the real problem with Biden’s gas prices and rising inflation are his own policies. A recent poll by I&I and Tipps showed 53 percent of Democrats believe Biden’s policies are to blame for inflation. Two-thirds of the poll’s respondents showed 66 percent believe too much federal spending has worsened inflation. Somehow despite it all, Biden refuses to take the blame.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks at United Performance Metals in Hamilton, Ohio, May 6, 2022.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:42 PM PT – Thursday, June 23 2022Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt (R) is waiting for the state Senate to pass his inflation relief package as he advocates for real solutions to the Biden inflation crisis. The Governor voiced that he is dedicated to providing Oklahomans relief amid skyrocketing gas prices, high taxes and runaway inflation.He insisted that Oklahomans need “relief right now,” not just a check for a tank of gas that will come in December.” This comes after Stitt called for a special session of the legislature back in May and demanded more solutions. He said Oklahoma is one of only 13 states taxing groceries and that he’s committed to changing this in his inflation relief package.“My inflation relief plan includes eliminating the state grocery tax and cutting personal income tax for every single Oklahoman,” he stated. “This will save the average Oklahoma family $453 each and every year.”The Governor was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, who also highlighted the Biden administration’s inability to provide real relief with it’s current budget plan. He reminded Oklahomans they should not have to wait for the Federal Government.“The only tax reform that’s currently in the budget is motor vehicle tax,” the governor uttered. “That’s not real relief. It only helps those who can afford a new car or  truck in the first place. Cutting the new car sales tax does nothing for families who are struggling to afford price for food, gas and everything in between.”If President Biden really wants to help lower energy costs for Americans, he should stop following the socialist Democrats’ energy playbook and start following Oklahoma’s.My response response to the president's proposal for a three-month federal gas tax holiday: pic.twitter.com/8wESy7MoOv— Governor Kevin Stitt (@GovStitt) June 22, 2022In addition to inflation relief, Stitt said he will always “back the blue” and ensure state law enforcement receives a pay increase.“Something I’m really excited about is pay increases four our law enforcement, he expressed. We will always back the blue in Oklahoma.”Stitt is now seeking re-election for his second term and his campaign got a major boost. He got backed with the backing of Trump. He called the incumbent Governor a “fearless defender” of the Second Amendment and “fighter for the incredible people of Oklahoma.”","FILE – Oklahoma Gov.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the family of one of the victims Nicole Langesfield reminisced on what transpired during the fateful day. Langesfield alongside her husband was one of the 98 victims who lost their lives when the building collapsed.Prior to their interview, an outside inquiry into the tragic incident was launched in an attempt to give the families of the deceased closure after initial investigations came back with inconclusive results.“We called her, we called her husband many times and it went straight to voicemail,” expressed the victims brother Martin Langesfield. “When we arrived on the scene we saw half the building was missing. We started to count the floors trying to find the apartment and we saw that half of my sisters apartment was still standing. 15 days later we got a knock on our door that they recovered my sister.”Additionally, they spoke about their experience in trying to get answers from Florida’s state attorney regarding what caused the tragedy. By their recollection most of their information regarding the collapse came from the media.“Show me the document,” said Langesfield. “This is an official document by the State Attorney Katherine Fernandez rundle who has declined to meet with us, with many families countless times. It’s around 40 pages. The first sentence of the document speaking in the collapse has the wrong date.”The posts were originally set up along a makeshift memorial wall about a block west on Harding Avenue last summer. HistoryMiami took the wall down for preservation but the town of Surfside got the posts back for the vigil and has offered to give them to family members.

This as the panel released a memo in which Commanders owner Daniel Snyder was accused of harassing, intimidating and trying to silence individuals who had alleged sexual harassment in the organization.Among the allegations detailed by the panel, Snyder was suspected of sending private investigators to the homes of accusers to offer them hush money and discourage them from participating in an investigation led by attorney Beth Wilkinson. The committee said Snyder’s work to interfere in the probe may have been to conceal or distract from his own role in troubling conduct. Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said the NFL was aware of his actions, but failed to stop him.” In April, six attorneys general condemned the NFL for its ongoing failure to address sexual harassment and gender discrimination across the league,” said Goodell. “The NFL itself has launched new investigations based on evidence brought to light by the committee.”""Commissioner, you believe in the First Amendment, don't ya?"" –@Jim_Jordan ""I do."" -NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ""Why do you ban @stoolpresidente from NFL games?"" -Jordan""Congressman, I'm not familiar with that issue."" -Goodell pic.twitter.com/ynlHj8CO9o— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) June 22, 2022Snyder declined to appear at the hearing, while a spokesperson said the hearing was “a politically charged show trial.” He added that Congress should not be investigating “an issue a football team addressed years ago.” Goodell acknowledged the work place in Washington was unacceptable in numerous aspects and asserted he is devoted to ensuring a safe and professional work environment.“I have been and remain committed to ensuring that all employees of the NFL and the 32 clubs work in a professional and supportive environment that is free from discrimination, harassment or other forms of illegal or unprofessional conduct,” stated Goodell.The NFL Commissioner also told lawmakers he does not have the authority to remove Snyder as an owner, but his fellow owners could vote to do so.

Since being sworn into office in January of 2021, Boebert has been both a champion for the “Save America Movement” and a staunch opponent of the progressive policies of the Biden administration.We're less than a week out from primary day – votes are already being cast!Help me win this race & continue to fight for our rights. When we're in a majority next year, Biden's agenda is going to screech to a halt!Donate today – help this campaign win!https://t.co/ORFn5nQFsl— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) June 23, 2022She has been quick to point out the inconsistencies in Democrat COVID policies such as masking small children in schools, while allowing migrants to flood into the country with a single COVID test or vaccine card. The Republican isn’t just worried about the people coming across the southern border. In order to combat the nation’s leading cause of death for those aged 18 to 45, Boebert has introduced legislation to classify Fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.“Take my home state of Colorado,” said Boebert. “In 2019 there were 222 deaths, in 2020 there were 540 and now in 2021 there were more than 900 fentanyl related deaths. Moms, dads, sons, daughters, fentanyl does not discriminate and we need to take serious steps to combat this.”Inbox: “Rep. Lauren Boebert Introduces Legislation to Classify Fentanyl as a Weapon of Mass Destruction” pic.twitter.com/6To6NJrPXh— Adam Kredo (@Kredo0) June 13, 2022Boebert is also an avowed defender of the Second Amendment. The Congresswoman has broken with establishment Republicans by taking the words “shall not be infringed upon'” literally, as Democrat-backed policies have made the country less safe.“We’re not going to send police to protect you,” she voiced. “I will not give an inch of the Second Amendment of the rights of the people to keep and bare arms to protect themselves, especially when cries from this chamber are calling to defund law enforcement and our southern border is wide open.”The firebrand also has a less than conventional way of illustrating what a tyrannical government can do to a defenseless population. Boebert is especially passionate about the Amendment she exercises on the House floor, the right to free speech.The Coloradan has long been a critic of the administration’s policing of the COVID narrative and the DHS’s persecution of parents at school board meetings. In reaction to Biden’s so-called disinformation task force, Boebert and her colleagues introduced the “Protecting Free Speech Act” to ensure the United States does not follow in the footsteps of Maoist China and Stalin’s Soviet Union.“Now is when we the people make our voices heard,” The Congresswoman expressed. “We will not accept being called domestic terrorists for showing up to school boards and we sure as hack won’t allow these Bureaucrats to create a ministry of truth to gaslight the American people.”President Trump has formally endorsed Rep. Boebert’s re-election campaign. He called her a “fearless leader” and a fighter against “loser RINOs” and “radical Democrats.”","Rep.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:47 PM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022Governor Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) forced the media to eat crow after his former opponent was indicted on federal charges. The DOJ charged Democrat Andrew Gillum with 21 counts on Wednesday.On Thursday, DeSantis was asked if he felt vindicated after being called a liar and a racist for bringing up the FBI probe into Gillum during the 2018 gubernatorial race. DeSantis responded by asking the media if they had any type of “mea culpa” for glorifying Gillum.“There were clearly a lot of issues there,” DeSantis voiced. “If you looked under the hood you saw it. What was presented to the public was that this guy was like the second coming. Never has a candidate been elevated that way by media outlets. Certainly not in the last 10 years or so. I can tell you if I had not won in 2018, this state would be in much worse shape and that’s not even a question.”According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Northern District of Florida, Gillum is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and making false statements to the FBI. Gillum served as mayor between 2014 and 2018. The 21 count indictment alleges that the crimes took place between 2016 and 2019, which covers most of the time Gillum was in office.“I have spent the last 20 years of my life in public service and continue to fight for the people,” Gillum said in a statement. “Every campaign I’ve run has been done with integrity. Make no mistake that this case is not legal, it is political. Throughout my career I have always stood up for the people of Florida and have spoken truth to power. There’s been a target on my back ever since I was the mayor of Tallahassee. They found nothing then, and I have full confidence that my legal team will prove my innocence now.”Andrew Gillum was indicted for stealing huge amounts of campaign money. This self-serving corruption is what campaign finance laws were passed to stop. I was prosecuted for giving away too much of my own money. Yet the leftists who shriek at me for this are silent about Gillum— Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) June 23, 2022Gillum entered rehab in 2020 after police found him in a Miami Beach Hotel with a male prostitute overdosing on drugs. An initial appearance is scheduled for Wednesday at 2 p.m. at the U.S. Courthouse in Tallahassee.","Florida Gov.

(Courtesy of San Jose Police Department via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:44 PM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022Disgraced actor Ezra Miller is reportedly housing a young mother and her children at a farm in Vermont. According to the Rolling Stone Thursday, the children’s father accused Miller of hosting the 25-year-old mother and her three children aged one to five since April.“I got a bad feeling in my stomach,” the dad told Rolling Stone. “I want to go get my kids, they mean the world to me.”Sources said they’re staying on the actors 96 acre farm. They claimed guns and marijuana are easily accessible. Video from April that was reviewed by Rolling Stone confirmed that at least eight assault weapons, rifles and handguns were seen lying around the living room. They also observed weapons propped up next to a pile of stuffed animals.Rolling Stone also spoke to the mother who said the two met in Hawaii and Miller helped the family escape her ”violent and abusive ex.” According to Hawaii Court records, the mother pursued one domestic abuse case against the father in 2021. Both parties failed to make a court appearance and the case was terminated. The father denied all abuse allegations.“They may have firearms for self-defense purposes, but they are stored in a part of the house that the children never go in,” she stated. “My kids are able to relax more into their healing because of the safety and nurturing Ezra has been providing for them.”In June 2022, an incident took place where a mother and her 12-year-old child were granted a temporary harassment prevention order against Miller in Massachusetts. The order was put in place for alleged inappropriate behavior. The young mother’s parents voiced that they are worried about their daughter and believe she is being held against her will.“We’re concerned about our daughter’s safety and want her to get out of this situation,” said her mother. “We’re worried about all the worst case scenarios. Miller is on the run with my child.”The young mother expressed that the 29-year-old has “provided a safe environment” for her kids and it has been a “healing heaven”.","This undated photo provided by the San Jose Police Department shows an arsenal of guns seized from suspect Bryan Velasquez, of San Jose, Calif.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022Justice Clarence Thomas said Dobbs could set precedent to overturn several landmark cases. In his concurring opinion issued on Friday, Thomas said all cases dealing with substantive due process precedents should be reconsidered.“In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” voiced Thomas. “Any substantive due process decision is demonstrably erroneous. We have a duty to correct the error established in those precedents.”Thomas mentioned that the three cases are all landmark decisions that established certain constitutional rights. In Griswold v. Connecticut, the court ruled in 1965 that married couples have a right to access contraceptive. In 2003, the court said in Lawrence v. Texas that states could not outlaw consensual gay sex. The Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.He noted cases favoring contraception, same sex marriage and “homosexual conduct” could be overturned. This comes after the Supreme Court handed down an opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, arguing the right to an abortion is not a form of liberty under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.“I join the opinion of the Court because it correctly holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion,” he said. “Respondents invoke one source for that right. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Court well explains why under our substantive due process precedents the purported right to abortion is not a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. Such a right is neither deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition nor implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”In a solo concurring opinion, Thomas says the court should reconsider rulings that protect contraception, same-sex relationships, and same-sex marriage. pic.twitter.com/zcQNko6NVR— Matt Ford (@fordm) June 24, 2022Thomas claimed that it is the duty of the Court to correct these errors.","FILE – In this Feb. 15, 2018, file photo, Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas sits as he is introduced during an event at the Library of Congress in Washington.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:45 AM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022The Biden administration expressed frustration with the Supreme Court’s decision allowing Americans to carry handguns in public.“We are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s ruling,” stated Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre. “The Second Amendment, as you’ve heard the President (Joe Biden) say, is not obsolete and permits common-sense gun regulation.”In a press briefing Thursday, she said Biden is still calling on individual states to continue enforcing anti-gun policies. She cited New York as an example where a concealed carry law from the year 1911 was upheld by the Department of Justice.“Am I disappointed…I’ll answer this one question and I was just talking to the governor of New York about this,” stated Biden. “I am disappointed in the Supreme Court gun decision. There is one little bit of solace in the minority making up the majority opinion has laid out that it effects not every state, it effects only 40 states.”Republicans have said the Biden administration has no respect for the Supreme Court or other US institutions, adding Democrats seek to impose their own agenda by all means necessary.I'm deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court’s ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. This ruling contradicts common sense and the Constitution, and should deeply trouble us all. I remain committed to doing everything in my power to reduce gun violence.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 23, 2022Their remarks came after the US Senate advanced the bipartisan gun reform bill, clearing the way for its full approval by the end of this week. The Senate voted 65 to 34 on Thursday to break a filibuster on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, despite concerns it may violate the Second Amendment.“This bipartisan gun safety legislation is progress and will save lives,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “While it is not everything we want, this legislation is urgently needed.”The last significant federal gun control legislation was passed in 1994. It banned the manufacture for civilian use of assault rifles and large capacity ammunition clips.The bill will increase background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21. It also closes legal loopholes in buying firearms and will provide funding for mental health programs and security in schools. The blueprint will also call for funding to incentivize states to implement red flag laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat.This comes as the Supreme Court ruled to expand gun rights the same day, allowing American’s to carry firearms in public for self defense. However the National Rifle Association,  rejected the deal.“We will oppose this gun control legislation because it falls short at every level,” the NRA said in a statement. “It does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law abiding gun owners.”Proponents of the bill hope to get it passed before the July recess.","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Thursday, June 23, 2022.

Scientists unearthed an Inca-era tomb under a house in Lima, which is believed to be at least 500-years-old.The tomb contained “multiple funerary tombs” wrapped in cloth, fine ornaments and some ceramics. It’s believed to have likely belonged to elites from the Riricancho society, which ruled the region prior to the Incas.“It was something I didn’t expect,” said Hipolito Tica, the owner of the house in Lima. “I didn’t know exactly what was there. I have no words to describe it. I hope that the next generations will know what we have found here. We thought there was only soil here, but there is a lot of history underneath that soil.”The Inca were conquered by Spanish invaders in 1532. They were famed for their gold and  sophisticated constructions, including the mountaintop royal retreat of Machu Picchu.The site was discovered during an excavation that began in May, after the homeowners renovation pans required an archaeological survey. Lima has been a popular site for archaeological finds from before and after the Inca.","This Nov. 30, 2019 photo shows the church on the grounds of The Alamo in San Antonio, Texas.
