2022-09-14,9:33 AM PT,Biden admin. praises Ukraine for using US weapons in counteroffensive,"Come you masters of war says the Biden administration amid the conflict in Ukraine. In a press conference Tuesday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said momentum is on the side of Ukraine as it battles Russian forces thanks to American weapons producers. He added, the Ukrainian troops are getting the hang of the billions-of-dollars of military aid funneled into the country’s armories.“And I would also add that many of the systems that we’ve been providing in just the last few weeks and couple of months have proven instrumental and effective in the Ukrainians ability to to go on the offense and to be actually quite effective on the defense in the last several days and weeks,” Kirby stated. “To include, of course, those advanced rocket systems that were that we’ve talked about so much. They’re using and they’re using them with great effect.”Kirby went on to echo typical Biden administration derisions of Russian President Vladimir Putin while claiming since the start of the war, he’s tried to obscure it. He also claimed the Russian people are beginning to question the tactics as well as spirit of the invasion and are putting pressure on Putin. Kirby pointed out, Russia’s recent air strikes have been missing their marks while Ukraine continues is counteroffensive.“It looks like they were largely going after the power grid,” he explained. “Mixed success, I think not all their strikes hit the targets or at least damaged the infrastructure to a maximum degree. But that was certainly what we would anticipate or what we analyzed as a response to what the Ukrainians were doing up in the north. It remains to be seen what their next steps are going to be here as the Ukrainians remain on the offensive up in the north and to continue to pursue a counteroffensive down in the south.”Meanwhile, Biden’s Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is warning of possible turmoil along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border as conflict brews in the region. In 2020, Russia brokered a peace deal between the two countries after a six-week war broke out over contested territory, killing more than 6,600 people.On Tuesday, however, fighting broke out on the Armenian side of the border with leaders from both sides pointing fingers at one another regarding who started the fight. Armenia says Azerbaijan launched a barrage of artillery to start the skirmish while Azerbaijan claims it was responding to a “large-scale provocation,” also adding Armenian troops set up mines and fired upon military personnel. According to reports, 99 troops were killed in the fighting.This prompted fears from the international community that another large scale war would break out and Russia would call back its peacekeeping personnel to add bodies to the forces fighting Ukraine.“Well, always, always concerns because whether Russia tries in some fashion to stir the pot to create a distraction from Ukraine is something that we’re always concerned about,” said Blinken. “But if Russia can actually use its own influence, for good which is to again, calm, calm the waters, end the violence and urge people to engage in good faith on building peace, that would be a positive thing.”However, reports from the Kremlin stress Putin is doing everything he can to de-escalate the conflict, echoing calls for peace with the international community. In the meantime, NSC spokesman Kirby and other members of Biden’s National Security apparatus vow to continue lines of communication with counterparts in Ukraine to take orders on the country’s military needs.","FILE – Pentagon spokesman John Kirby speaks during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) speaks during a Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security hearing. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:59 AM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022Violent crime has continued to rise in Memphis, Tennessee. This comes as Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) recently slammed soft-on-crime policies hindering the nation.“We in Tennessee have just been heartbroken over what has happened in Memphis with criminals being back on the streets,” stated the Republican lawmaker.Her comments came after recent attacks in Memphis, where it was discovered the suspects in two recent attacks had been released from prison before serving their full sentences for prior convictions.Eliza Fletcher, 34, was allegedly abducted during her morning run on September 2 and her remains were later found behind an empty house. The suspect, 38-year-old ex-con Cleotha Abston, also known as Cleotha Henderson, served only 20 years of a 24-year prison sentence for an armed kidnapping. He was released in 2020. Henderson has also been indicted on rape, kidnapping and felony firearms charges after allegedly sexually assaulting a victim in 2021.Additionally, the recent shooting in Memphis that killed four and injured three others is being tied to 19-year-old Ezekiel Kelly, which came after Kelly was previously charged with criminal attempted first degree murder. Kelly reportedly pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault in 2021, but walked free early only serving 11-months of his three-year prison sentence.Meanwhile, Tennessee state Rep. Cameron Sexton (R-Tenn.) recently said the Truth in Sentencing law could have kept Henderson and Kelly behind bars had it been enacted earlier than July 1 of this year. The law says if an individual is convicted of murder, they must serve their full sentence. If convicted of lesser crimes like aggravated assault, however, they only need to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.“If this law would have been in place back in 2000 or just a little bit ago for the other case, the Kelly case, those individuals would still be behind bars,” Sexton stated. “They wouldn’t have been out, they wouldn’t have had these victims, these individuals would not have been killed.”A recent survey by the Major Cities Chiefs Association found overall violent crime spiked 4.2 percent from January to June this year. However, in the case of Ezekiel Kelly, Democrat Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland is placing the blame on the judicial system.“The problem is not the Memphis Police Department, cause they’re arresting people,” said Strickland. “The problem is this judicial system that will not punish. That is our problem.”Political analysts say violent crime could be a driving force for voter turnout in the upcoming midterm elections.","Ranking Member Sen.

It also revealed that the DOJ had subpoenaed for security footage from Trump’s home dating back to January 10, 2022- a week before 15-boxes of Mar-a-Lago documents were taken by the national archives.Whether Trump produced that requested evidence still remains redacted.","This photo shows an aerial view of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2022.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:05 PM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022While speaking at Boston’s JFK Library on Monday, Biden gave an update on his administration’s campaign promise to find a cure for cancer. He announced that his goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50 percent within the next 25 years.I believe we can end cancer as we know it and even cure cancers once and for all.— President Biden (@POTUS) September 12, 2022During his speech, Biden attempted to rally Americans behind this battle by comparing it to President John F. Kennedy’s race to beat communists to the moon. For Biden, this vow is a personal one after he lost his son Beau Biden to brain cancer in 2015.“In February, I laid out our plan that is bold, ambitious, and, I might add, completely doable,” Biden said. “The goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50%, at least 50% in the next 25 years. To turn more cancers from death sentences into chronic diseases people can live with, to create more supportive experience for patients and families, and update, update our fight against the cancer.”Part of Biden’s plan is to assign biologist and former government scientist Doctor Renee Wegrzyn to be the Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health or ARPA-H. The ARPA-H was established earlier this year in March and is being tasked with studying potential treatments or cures for cancer..@POTUS announces his intent to nominate Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). pic.twitter.com/PtuqX6ILRU— CSPAN (@cspan) September 12, 2022The Democrat also announced a new scholars program to provide resources to early career scientists studying the disease.“ARPA-H will have the singular purpose to drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect and treat diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes and other diseases and enable us to live healthier lives,” Biden said.Additionally, Biden announced the signing of a new executive order directing the federal government to ensure the technology needed for such studies is built here in the United States. However, the Democrat did not elaborate on how he would uphold this order.“But it’s not enough to invent technologies to save lives. We need to manufacture advanced biotechnologies here in the United States,” Biden stated. “That’s why today I signed an executive order that directs the federal government to ensure biotechnology is invented in the United States of America, are made in the United States of America.”Despite this, what could’ve been considered a speech which delivered on his promise to be a ‘great unifier,’ quickly turned into political theater. Biden reverted to Democrat talking points about so-called inequities in the country’s healthcare system which supposedly bars non-white, the disabled and LGBTQ individuals from affording medical treatment.“It’s a disease we often diagnose too late and have too few ways to prevent it in the first place, where there are stark inequities based on race, disability, zip code, sexual orientation, gender identity and other factors,” Biden said.In the meantime, over 250 cancer research programs have been established since 2017.","President Joe Biden arrives with Vice President Kamala Harris and Lovette Jacobs, a fifth year IBEW Local 103 electrical apprentice in Boston, for a ceremony where Biden will sign H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 3:33 PM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022The White House’s second in command has a very different vision for America than its founders. Vice President Kamala Harris said that the southern border is secure but has claimed that the Supreme Court is a threat to the United States.Harris made these statements while on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd over the weekend. There, Todd pressed the border czar on the nearly two million known border crossings during her tenure. The Vice President asserted that the nation’s boundaries are stable. She blamed the Trump administration for the influx of illegal immigrants.“We have a secure border and that is a priority for any nation including ours in our administration,” Harris said. “But there are still a lot of problems that we are trying to fix given the deterioration that has happened over the last four years. We also have to put in place a law and a plan for a pathway for citizenship.”Harris also blamed Republican governors for playing politics with people’s lives. The Democrat asserted that Americans should be more concerned than they are with the recent rulings from the Supreme Court. She called the judicial body an activist court and then lambasted them for returning the abortion policy back to the states. The Californian claimed such a decision to be a threat to the American system. Harris said Democrats must eliminate the filibuster to protect democracy by ramming their agenda through both houses with a slim majority.“The President has been clear on this issue and on a very important issue in addition to that important issue which is voting rights,” The Vice President said. “And the President has been very clear, he will sign into law and not let the filibuster get in the way, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Acts and the Freedom to Vote Act.” Harris also warned that election deniers pose a threat to the country. This comes as she and the Democrats gear up to increase their majorities in the House and Senate. However, when Todd asked Harris why Democrats elevated Republican opponents who question the 2020 election, the Vice President dodged the question and touted her own campaign record.""You’re not worried that this reflects poorly on the Democrats?""

10:27 AM PT",Cringe Optics: Biden Takes Victory Lap During Economic Nosedive,"Cringe Optics: Biden Takes Victory Lap During Economic NosediveChanel Rion — OAN Chief White House CorrespondentUPDATED 10:27 AM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022An optically difficult day for the White House – as the economy tanks at news of roaring inflation and a higher than expected CPI rate, Biden staffers assembled the President for a photo op taking the bow for his inflation reduction efforts.The White House found itself stuck in a corner Tuesday. Having slated the day for “thousands of supporters” to stand in “celebration” of Biden’s efforts to fight inflation, the Consumer Price Index delivered a shocking blow.August inflation rates surged against expectations bringing the average inflation rate – excluding food and energy – to 8.3%. This is double the core CPI forecast. But in spite of the evidence, the White House plowed forward, taking a victory lap:With the Inflation Reduction Act, the American people won and the special interests lost.Today, we celebrate its passage at the White House. pic.twitter.com/FQDRLkKK1m— President Biden (@POTUS) September 13, 2022Many economists – and in turn the White House – expected the August CPI numbers to actually go down due to the decline in oil and gas prices from the previous month. Gas is down nearly 10%. But Tuesday’s numbers proved not only was this drop in gas prices not enough to stave off economic woes – but the economy is deteriorating at a much faster rate than expected. The average American can’t keep up.The typical American household now pays $460 MORE per month on the same goods and services they were paying for last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. That’s over $5500 more per year per household.President Biden, ahead of his Inflation Reduction Act signing event at the White House, was forced to release a statement insisting his policies are taking America in the right direction despite the evidence:Today’s data show more progress in bringing global inflation down in the US economy.  Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country these last two months: that is welcome news for American families, with more work still to do.  Gas prices are down an average of $1.30 a gallon since the beginning of the summer.Undergirding Biden’s insistence of “progress” in the US economy are three big narratives;  real wages are up, gas is down, and inflation was not cause by Biden’s $1.9 Trillion spending bill.But wages are not up: Average hourly pay, adjusted for inflation are down -2.8%.A closer look at individual necessities only make the picture worse; Eggs are up nearly 40% since last year, food and basic costs are gobbling up any small gains being made in US salaries. The US economy has now suffered 17 consecutive months under Biden spending policies where inflation outpaced wage growth.That basic costs for virtually everything are spiking significantly cancels out any good news on the gas front. While gas prices have gone down 10% in the last month, compared to this time last year, gas prices are still up a whopping 25% year over year. Utilities are up 33% since last year.Even the head of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors confronted the bad news bluntly: “CPI report not pretty.”CPI report not pretty. Headline fine (0.1% CPI for Aug or a 1.4% annual rate in that month, with prices up 8.3% over the last year).Problem is excluding volatile food and energy and was ugly (0.6% for Aug or a 7.0% annual rate).Broad-based relief not coming. pic.twitter.com/WVODxYmrYm— Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) September 13, 2022And since the passage of Biden’s $1.9 Trillion spending bill, inflation has only been aggravated month after month contradicting the Biden position insisting inflation would only be temporary:Happy 1 year anniversary of Biden lying about inflation only being ""temporary."" pic.twitter.com/p4KZO9eDSx— Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) July 19, 2022Just last month, Biden was mocked for claiming there was zero inflation – touting a slight decrease in inflation that has since been cancelled out.Tuesday, Biden took to social media to encourage Americans to join him in celebrating his Inflation Reduction Act.Exactly four weeks ago, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law.So today, we're celebrating.Tune in at 3 PM ET as I deliver remarks and welcome the leaders and advocates who made it happen to the People's House.— President Biden (@POTUS) September 13, 2022At the time of Biden’s tweet, the Nasdaq plunged by over 840 points into the red.

An expert on Chinese surveillance and social media claimed that TikTok is a disaster waiting to happen.Geoffrey Cain testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday. There, he claimed that TikTok’s software contains powerful surveillance and data collection capabilities. He also noted that the app is owned by a company that must comply with the dictates of the Chinese Communist Party.TikTok cannot be trusted. Chinese law requires its parent company ByteDance to partake in intelligence operations if it's requested. pic.twitter.com/EHMSeFy2P0— Geoffrey Cain (@geoffrey_cain) September 14, 2022“TikTok executives will, under Chinese law, face a minimum of 20 days detention if they refuse to turn over data on anyone in the world,” Cain said. “And this could be anybody, anybody in China, anybody who’s traveling through China, through Hong Kong. This is a documented legal situation, and it’s not something that TikTok, despite claiming to be an American company, can avoid.”Cain said TikTok uses a shell corporation in the Cayman Islands to throw up a red herring in order to distract from these obligations to the CCP. The American branch of TikTok, and its Chinese developer parent company ByteDance, both report to the same shell company in the Cayman Islands. The two branches are also both run by the same CEO. Cain said the Chinese government has made its ambitions clear and that data is its biggest target.“An authoritarian regime such as China will attempt to get access to that data and use it to build artificial intelligence capabilities, capabilities that might involve espionage, spying on military officials, government officials,” Cain announced. “This is a major, major Trojan horse that needs to be dealt with. Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) pointed out that TikTok is becoming increasingly more aggressive in its pursuit of your data.“One of the things that I’ve seen from TikTok even recently is the ability to be able to keep up with keystrokes,” he said. “If you use their app to be able to then go to other websites that they can then track your keystrokes. That would include credit card numbers, that would include passwords, user IDs, all of those things as well.”Data that the CCP may be harvesting from TikTok users plays right into the hands of China’s digital ambitions which poses a major National Security threat.",Chesnot/Getty Images,https://d2pd5v545ww278.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/4deb96f0-ef78-11e9-b9bc-85aa578317a3.webp, Trump says FBI and DOJ are targeting and harassing ‘dozens of amazing patriots who stand for America’TOPICS:appsByteDanceCCPNational SecuritynewsOANOANNpoliticstiktok. social media SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/expert-testimony-tiktok-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen/

Paul stressed that the vaccine guidelines do not respect the science on natural immunity. The Senator added that he will shed light on efforts by government officials that have resulted in windfall revenues for vaccine manufacturers.Rand Paul to Fauci: ""You refuse to answer whether anybody on the vaccine committees gets royalties from the Pharma industry… When we get in charge, we're gonna change the rules and you will have to divulge where you get your royalties from.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., speak with reporters after watching a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy live-streamed into the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, Wednesday, March 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:02 PM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022House Republicans held a press conference where they slammed the Democrats failing policies. GOP members claimed that those policies hurt the nation. At the press conference they also discussed the Democrats failed leadership and how it has resulted in making Americans ”less safe.”When speaking to reporters on Wednesday, New York Representative Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) slammed the uptick in violent crime that the Big Apple State has experienced under Democrat leadership. She asserted that the Democrats were aware of their political shortcomings but they double-down on failing policies.“The lawlessness and rampant violent crime continue in our communities due to Democrat’s soft on crime policies,” Stefanik said. “And the sad part is Democrats know the consequences of their radical policies and they continue to double-down.”Stefanik went on, adding that Americans should not be subject to policies which aid the rich and hurt the middle and lower classes.“The American people cannot afford another year of failed Democrat one-party rule in Washington,” she said. “It’s time for leadership, which listens to the concerns of every American, which House Republicans are doing every day.”The New York firebrand was followed by California Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) who pointed to the Democrat’s recent shortcomings in the Golden State. Valadao said he spoke with working class families whose concerns have yet to be alleviated by the White House or California’s liberal leadership.“I spent the last month back home talking to a lot of different groups of people, and the biggest concern which kept coming up in all these conversations was just how expensive it is to live,” Valadao said.The California representative said the rising costs for fuel, groceries and just about everything else is the biggest issue facing his constituents. Valadao also said blue-collar companies want to invest in California but have been barred by liberal policies and a power grid which can’t even support the residents who live there now.“I hear from businesses across all different types of industries who want to invest in new technologies to create jobs in California, but they don’t have the required electricity needed to make these investments worth it,” Valadao mentioned. Valadao said that Joe Biden has refused to issue permits to companies to invest in the State. He also mentioned that the permits he has issued have been hindered by California Governor Gavin Newsom who shuts down the industry in order to protect the environment. The California Representative was followed by New York Representative Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.). She echoed criticisms highlighted by Representative Stefanik.Malliotakis reiterated that the biggest issue facing her constituents is violent crime. She claimed that the uptick in crime has been fueled by lax-prosecution under New York’s soft-on-crime leaders.“Everything from rape, robbery, felony, assault, burglary, grand theft auto, transit crimes, sex crimes, they’re all up,” Malliotakis said. “And people in my city do not feel safe. And there a number of policies which have led to this.” The Representative said that she has put forward numerous proposals aimed at curbing crime. This includes legislation which weigh’s offenders’ criminality. All of her proposals have been shot down by Democrats. Malliotakis then gave several examples of career criminals who have flaunted the city’s no-bail policies as they continue to repeat their crimes without discipline. She later spoke on the deadly impact the open-border has had on her people. There, she asserted that fentanyl was streaming from the border without hindrance.“In my district, fentanyl deaths are already up 13% this year, and we know that it’s coming from our southern border,” Malliotakis announced. “So, it’s a combination of the federal policies and the state policies under one-party Democrat rule which have proved a disaster. And its leading to my constituents and so many Americans across the nation being less safe.” The presser concluded with Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). He blasted the Biden administration’s fiscal policies which, according to him, have flushed the market down the drain.“President Biden and Nancy Pelosi continue to show how out of touch and tone deaf they are by throwing a party yesterday at the White House to celebrate inflation at the exact same time that the market’s crashing because of inflation that President Biden and Speaker Pelosi created,” Scalise said. Scalise said he expects Democrats to put forward legislation to address some of the pressing issues facing the nation, an expectation which he says has yet to be met. He then criticized the crisis at the border. The Republican asserted that the administration has repeatedly lied about the true situation in southern states which he said is ”out of control”.The Minority Whip said Republicans have tried to put forward legislation to address the problems, but have been shot down by democrats in office.“I wish we had bills on the floor to address those here, we’ve laid out to Speaker Pelosi what those bills are, that would lower gas prices, that would provide a stable energy supply, that would lower inflation or secure our border,” he said. “But they won’t bring any of those bills to the House floor because they want to continue doubling down on their inflation-ridden policies, raising taxes, raising spending to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.”","House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of La., left, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calif., and Rep.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:36 PM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has called Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-S.C.) Bill that would ban abortions after 15-weeks an ‘extreme’ piece of legislation.During a press briefing on Tuesday, Jean-Pierre claimed the South Carolina Senator’s Bill is “wildly out of step with what Americans believe.” The Biden White House official also accused Graham of placing no exemptions for health in his legislation. However, Graham’s Bill notably includes exceptions for rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk.Karine Jean-Pierre: ""I'm going to quote Lindsey Graham from August 7, 2022, and he said, 'I've been consistent. I think states should decide the issue of marriage and states should decide the issue of abortion.' That's from his own mouth and now he wants to do a national ban."" pic.twitter.com/V9W7nWXvVF— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 13, 2022Jean-Pierre also sought to cast the White House’s advocacy for abortion as progress.“Republicans in Congress are focused on taking right away for millions, millions of women across the country,” Jean-Pierre stated. “While we are fighting for progress, they are fighting to take us back. President Biden and congressional Democrats are committed to restoring the protections of Roe, and they are committed to doing so in the face of continued radical steps by elected Republicans to put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians instead of women and their doctors.” Jean-Pierre’s attempt to paint Republicans as regressive comes as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he is not on board with Graham’s Bill.","Sen.

On Wednesday, the House Speaker claimed that Democrats will pick up House seats and stave-off a red wave.“There are some among you who belittle my political instincts and the rest, I got us here to the majority twice and I don’t intend on giving it up,” Pelosi said.Polling and Joe Biden’s approval rating suggest that Democrats will likely lose the House in the fall. However, Pelosi is ignoring those bellwethers. She also refuses to say whether she’ll seek another term as Speaker.Pundits are pointing out that Pelosi had the same optimism for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:44 AM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022Damning information from a second Hunter Biden laptop may be circulating around on the web. New York Magazine contributing editor Andrew Rice appeared on CNN to discuss the latest “laptop from hell.” Rice penned an article on the laptop saga alongside Olivia Nuzzi, verifying at least one personal electronic device has fallen into someone else’s hands.The editor confirmed numerous aspects of Hunter’s life were extracted, including emails, texts, transactions and explicit content. Given the younger Biden’s history of reported substance abuse, Rice said its entirely likely the initial laptop was not the only sensitive data cache he misplaced.“People close to him have propagated the idea that perhaps actually there is a second laptop out there that might actually trace back too, which goes back to the general point that Hunter Biden was capable of losing more than one laptop that potentially contained devastating information about himself during this time period in his life,” continued the contributing editor.In fact, laptop whistleblower Jack Maxey claims an additional 450 gigabytes of additional data was recovered from a hard drive allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden. The drive also contained 80,000 previously unseen images that Maxey described as more disturbing than what was contained in the initial leak.Additionally, the U.K. Daily Mail has released a video of Hunter confessing that Russian drug dealers confiscated another one of his laptop during a Las Vegas bender.Some have claimed laptop repair man John Mac Isaac could not positively identify the first son due to the fact that he is legally blind. While Rice acknowledged Mac Isaac is visually impaired, his affliction does not completely obscure his sight. Furthermore, Rice asserts the FBI would not have seized the initial laptop from Mac Isaac if it was little more than right wing disinformation.“He has a subpoena that the FBI served on him and they came and took away this laptop. In passed into the hands of the FBI, presumably because it had some kind of relevance they thought to the ongoing federal criminal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances that status of which we really don’t know much about.”Federal prosecutors are currently considering leveling charges against the first son for tax violations and providing a false statement to purchase a firearm. Meanwhile, this story has barely made waves outside of non-mainstream bubbles while Democrat-aligned actors have worked to call the authenticity of the original story into question.Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have also been probing into Hunter Biden’s usage of his father’s influence to secure foreign business deals.","FILE – In this Oct. 11, 2012, file photo, Hunter Biden waits for the start of the his father’s, Vice President Joe Biden’s, debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky.

During an interview on Tuesday with the National Press Club, Adams said he believes it is ‘imperative’ to give migrants legal access to employment.Today @PressClubDC @ericadamsfornyc in conversation with @JenJudson pic.twitter.com/7ME9YZSXMq— Bill McCarren (@mccarrennews) September 13, 2022This comes as the process for people seeking permission to work in the United States takes about six months after an individual files an asylum application. Adams said that the federal government is expecting migrants to wait in the country for months without working.“The strange this is, particularly in New York and across the country, there’s such a demand for a need of employees,” Adams said. “Many of my industries are dying to get employees. So, if you are a nurse from Venezuela, why am I having you sit down and be not using your medical profession to help in the hospitals that we are, that we have a shortage of nurses. If you are an engineer, we have a shortage of engineers. If you are a teacher, we have a shortage of teachers, bilingual teachers. So, that six-month delay is creating a bigger crisis.”Adams went on to state that while illegal immigrants should be vetted before entering the country, there should be a pathway for them to receive housing and education.","New York City Mayor Eric Adams attends a Michael Kors fashion show during Fashion Week, Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2022, in New York.
