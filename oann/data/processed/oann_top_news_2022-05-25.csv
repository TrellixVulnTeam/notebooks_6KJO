Bush. According to a recently unsealed search warrant Shihab Ahmend Shihab detailed his plan to take revenge for the Iraq War to an informant.That same informant reportedly drove the suspect around Dallas, Texas in February, where he took video and photos of Bush’s home and offices. Federal agents said the suspect wanted to assassinate Bush because he felt the former president was responsible for “killing many Iraqis and breaking apart the country after the 2003 US military invasion.”“President Bush has all the confidence in the world,” said the former Chief of Staff Freddy Ford. “In the U.S. Secret Service, our law enforcement and intelligence communities.”The FBI claimed that Shihab belonged to a group named Arabic for Thunder, headed until recently by a former pilot for the executed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The FBI also surveilled the suspect’s WhatsApp account to collect evidence and said he had been living in the U.S. since 2020.Shihab allegedly told the informant “he wanted to be involved in the actual attack and assassination” and that he “did not care if he died as he would be proud to have been involved.” A federal agent mentioned that he inquired about how to obtain fake FBI and police badges.Colleague Bill Mears confirms an ISIS suspect is under arrest for alleged plot to assassinate former President George W BushThe suspect– identified as Shihab Ahmed Shihab– is due in federal court in Columbus, OH shortly where he will appear before a federal magistrate— Kelly Phares (@kellyfphares) May 24, 2022The suspect is also accused of trying to smuggle four other Iraqi nationals into the country across the southern border.

Five-percent or up to 25-thousand dollars of mortgage loan amount, you can get support from.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:55 PM PT – Tuesday, May 24, 2022Texas Governor Greg Abbott made a visit to the southern border on Wednesday, to get a first-hand look at President Joe Biden’s migrant crisis. The governor toured Texas National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety border security assets in Eagle Pass, Texas.During a press conference, Abbott provided an update on his state’s border security strategies along the Rio Grande. He said the lone star state will use resources to build a stronger, more efficient barrier to deter illegal crossings including razor wire.“One of those strategies is increasing the quantity and quality in the types of barriers that we’re putting up,” said Abbott. “A tool that people agree is an effective tool is the concertina wire, which is the razor wire barrier that makes it far more difficult for people to cross the border.”Abbott also discussed the state’s continued efforts to work alongside law enforcement partners in Mexico and the several Mexican states including Chihuaha, which he signed historic border security agreements with last month. The Republican governor also detailed the state’s on-going support for local border communities including Eagle Pass as they grapple with the mass influx of illegal immigrants. If all else fails sending more buses of illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C. could be in the cards.“We are also making available to Eagle Pass and Maverick County the ability to be bussed to Washington, D.C. if a large number of people are milling around,” the governor voiced. “As of today we have sent 45 buses to Washington, D.C. and a whole lot more where that’s coming from.” https://twitter.com/GovAbbott/status/1529094643891245060Abbott’s remarks come on the day Joe Biden intended to lift Title 42. While it’s expiration was blocked by a federal court he warned this is only a temporary result. He stressed that the lone star state will not waiver in it’s efforts to secure the border.","FILE – In this March 16, 2020, file photo, Texas Gov.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:55 AM PT – Tuesday, May 24, 2022The man accused of attacking Dave Chapelle admits he was triggered by the comedian’s jokes. In an exclusive jailhouse interview with the New York Post, 23-year-old Isaiah Lee confirmed the reason he rushed on stage during a show at the Hollywood Bowl.Lee said he identifies as bi-sexual and felt Chapelle’s jokes about the LGBTQ community were too insensitive. He claimed he intended to enjoy the show but instead grew increasingly angry.“I identify as bisexual,” said Isaiah Lee. “I wanted him to know what he said was triggering.”The rapper who once wrote a song about Chapelle said he brought a replica handgun with a retractable knife that night because he is a “minor celebrity” and needed the protection. Lee has remained behind bars since his May 3 arrest in connection with the alleged attack on the comedian with a judge refusing to lower his bail.“I wanted him to know that next time he should consider first running his material by people it could effect,” Lee voiced. “I’m also a single dad and my son is five. It’s a struggle and I wanted Dave Chappelle to know it’s not a joke.”Prosecutors decided that the Bowl incident did not rise to the level of a felony, noting that Chappelle was not injured in the attack and Lee did not have the weapon in his hand at the time.Update: Soros-supported Los Angeles district attorney @GeorgeGascon has declined to pursue the case against Isaiah Lee, the man who was arrested over tackling Dave Chapelle on stage at the Hollywood Bowl.

(AP Photo/Joe Maiorana, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:47 AM PT – Monday, May 23, 2022Former President Donald Trump still holds an immense sway over who will lead the Republican Party in several down ballot races. According to numbers crunched by Breitbart News Sunday, Trump is 81-and-three in picking the winner of GOP primaries heading into Tuesday’s batch of elections.This includes 23 wins and two losses garnered in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Kentucky and Idaho last week. Georgia lawyer and candidate for the states sixth congressional district Jake Evans (R-Ga.) touted how the so-called “trump bump” influenced his candidacy.“We are surging and have continued to be surging really for the past month,” said Evans. “Trumps endorsement catapulted us forward and he has really pushed us on a strong trajectory, we feel great about it. The reality is voters want to get back to the America first agenda. They wanna get back to the agenda that delivered four of the best years we’ve had in a very long time.”Trump has orchestrated key wins in battleground elections including in Ohio’s senate race to replace outgoing Republican Senator Rob Portman. Trump-endorsed JD Vance (R-Ohio) won the GOP primary against Josh Mandel (R-Ohio) who was backed by other establishment Republicans.Additionally, the former president oversaw a huge victory for the America First movement in Pennsylvania when Doug Mastriano (R-Pa.) won the states GOP gubernatorial primary. Other major victories for him include  Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Bo Hines (R-N.C.) and Andy Barr (R-Ky.).“We’ve got to get back to putting American’s first,” declared Evans. “The liberals seem to be more focused on Ukraine over in Europe than they are actually here at home domestically making sure that we can actually feed our babies. We need to make sure American manufacturing returns back to America.”In the meantime, their are several key primaries that could set the course of the general election coming up. the jury’s still out over who won the GOP senate primary in Pennsylvania. The election results were too close to call.","FILE – Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at the Delaware County Fairgrounds, April 23, 2022, in Delaware, Ohio.

(CDC via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:50 PM PT – Monday, May 23, 2022New York City confirmed it’s first case of Monkeypox on Friday. Officials say the patient is being quarantined as their investigation continues. This marks the second confirmed case in the U.S. after another man was found in Boston earlier in the week.Monkeypox causes flu-like symptoms before the characteristic rash develops. The virus is spread through close contact with people, animals or material infected with the virus. It enters the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, the eyes, nose and mouth“We’ve seen a few cases in Europe over the last five years, just in travelers,” said Dr. Rosamund Lewis, who runs the WHO’s smallpox research. “This is the first time we’re seeing cases across many countries at the same time in people who have not traveled to the endemic regions in Africa.” #Monkeypox has so far been reported from 11 countries that normally don't have the disease. WHO is working with these countries & others to expand surveillance, and provide guidance.There are about 80 confirmed cases, and 50 pending investigations. More likely to be reported. pic.twitter.com/YQ3pVJVNVQ— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) May 20, 2022The outbreak has quickly advanced across Europe and North America over the last week and is expected to be far more widespread as more doctors look for the signs and symptoms. The CDC has put medical professionals on alert and is warning those with higher risk factors, particularly men who have sex with other men, to be vigilant.“Many diseases can be spread through sexual contact. You could get a cough or a cold through sexual contact,” said WHO advisor Andy Seale. “It doesn’t mean that it’s a sexually transmitted disease.” Seale’s agreed many of the people infected in the current outbreak identify as gay or bisexual, but “this is a virus that could affect anyone.” Monkeypox is taking over the global conversation and has left many questioning the validity of the virus’s actual threat.PCR tests are used to identify the infection.TOPICS:AfricadiseaseEuropeINVESTIGATIONmonkeypoxNew York CitynewsOANOANNPCRrosamund lewissicknesssmallpoxWHO TWEETPIN","This 1997 image provided by the CDC during an investigation into an outbreak of monkeypox, which took place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formerly Zaire, and depicts the dorsal surfaces of the hands of a monkeypox case patient, who was displaying the appearance of the characteristic rash during its recuperative stage.
