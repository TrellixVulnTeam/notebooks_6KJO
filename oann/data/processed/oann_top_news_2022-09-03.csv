2022-09-02,11:54 AM PT,"Sept. 2, 1945: Japan formally surrenders","77-years ago today, President Harry Truman declared September 2nd V-J Day as Japan formally surrendered resulting in the end World War II.While scenes of Japan in World War II recalled images of Iwo Jima, there was no warfare in the Tokyo Bay on this day in 1945. Instead of picking up weapons, representatives only picked up pens to formalize Japan’s surrender to allied forces.The Battle of the Pacific had tilted to allied favor in the summer of 1945. In June, Americans forces captured Okinawa. In August, the United States dropped a pair of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities. On August 15th, Japan’s Emperor went on national radio to announce his surrender. The US accepted the surrender and set September 2nd as the day for a formal surrender ceremony.On this day in 1945, 250 allied warships anchored in the Tokyo Bay as representatives from 10 countries boarded the USS Missouri as General Douglas MacArthur gave an opening address.“We are gathered here, representatives of the major warring powers, to conclude a solemn agreement whereby peace may be restored,” General Douglas MacArthur said.  At 9:05 local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu was the first to sign. General MacArthur gave his autograph at 9:08. Nine more representatives would sign and in less than 20 minutes six years of world war finally came to a complete close.While many Americans celebrated after the Emperors surrender in mid-August, President Truman officially declared September 2nd as ‘Victory in Japan Day’ as World War II — the bloodiest conflict of the 20th century — officially came to a close.","FILE- In this Sept. 2, 1945, file photo, Admiral Chester W.

(Emrah Gurel/AP Photo)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:33 AM PT – Friday, September 2, 2022Critics around the globe are crying out against China’s apparent human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. The whole world seems to be behind a recent United Nations report detailing China’s inhumane treatment of the group.In a press briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration welcomes the report and urged the Chinese Communist Party to cease its atrocities. She even went as far as to call the crimes against humanity “genocidal,” which is a move likely to irk America’s number one adversary.“The report deepens our grave concern regarding the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity that China is perpetrating,” stated Jean-Pierre. “Our position on the atrocities in Xinjiang has been clearly demonstrated with our words and in our actions. The Biden administration has taken concrete measures, including improving visa restrictions, Global Magnitsky Act and other financial sanctions, export controls, import restrictions and the president has rallied allies and partners including the G7 commitment to ensure all global supply chains are free from the use of forced labor, including from Xinjiang.”On Wednesday, the UN’s Human Rights Commission released a 48-page report assessing more than a million Uyghurs were taken from their homes and concentration camps in China’s Western Xinjiang province. At these camps, Uygurs are forced to do hard manual labor as well as ditch their language and culture. Additionally, many women in these camps are raped and sexually assaulted, while prisoners as a whole are routinely tortured and beaten.Many Uyghur advocacy groups came out in support of the report stressing the victims have fled to other parts of the country, suffering the consequences of experiencing the discriminatory abuses while leaving others behind.“I interpreted for many survivors,” said Rahima Mahmut, Director of the World Uyghur Congress, U.K. “I know the horrors that they have experienced, including sexual violence, torture, sterilization and extremely disturbing details of what has been happening and to those being detained and also those who are, you know, living in their own home. They also been suffering because they have…most of their families have direct family members or relatives, you know, being taken, and they don’t know what happened to them for so many years.”Meanwhile, the Chinese government is combating what they call allegations against its regime. Officials are trying to undermine the credibility of the report by claiming it’s a fabrication spawned by the US and other anti-China Western countries. Reports say China delayed the reports release in an effort to either kill it from going public or white wash its atrocities.They even launched a propaganda campaign against the US trying to deflect attention to the US response to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the virus plaguing the world from Wuhan, China. However, these efforts are not being welcomed by the international community with activists seeing through the fog of attempted deception. They say governments should punish China diplomatically as a result of the UN’s findings.“We don’t believe Chinese government, this government will act,” Mahmut continued. “We’ve seen the reaction from the Chinese foreign minister and the rest. They are completely denying that, saying ‘this is completely fabricated, it’s not true’. And so from that attitude the governments, the UN should recognize who they are dealing with. This is not a regime that you can have diplomatic relationship and to fix any problems.”In the meantime, Joe Biden is scheduled to meet with China’s President Xi Jingping in person next week. This comes in light of the new report China’s aggressive rhetoric and military actions against US officials meeting Taiwanese leaders as well as the White House’s concern with China’s allies amid the Ukraine crisis.Critics hope Biden puts China in check as the CCP looks to usurp America as global hegemon and is signaling it could invade Taiwan soon.","A protester from the Uighur community living in Turkey holds an anti-China placard during a protest in Istanbul on Oct. 1, 2020.

1:17 PM PT",DeSantis Debrief: Poll shows Democrat Crist trails DeSantis 51%-46%,"DeSantis Debrief: Poll shows Democrat Crist trails DeSantis 51%-46%Neil W. McCabe — OAN Political Correspondent, TallahasseeUPDATED 1:17 PM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022(Tallahassee, Fla.) There’s just a little over two months before the November election when Sunshine State Republican Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis faces former Democratic congressman Charlie Crist, and already the campaign is getting hot.At the briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre accused DeSantis of instigating political violence that is threatening American democracy: “And just last week you had Governor Ron DeSantis suggested that Dr. Fauci should be physically assaulted.”Jean-Pierre was referring to a joke the governor told at an Aug. 24 Seminole County “Keep Florida Free” rally: “I’m just sick of seeing him. I know he says he’s going to retire. Someone needs to grab that little elf and chuck him across the Potomac.”The attack from the White House comes after the Democratic Governors Association released a poll showing DeSantis leading Crist 51 percent to 46 percent.The poll shows Crist within striking distance, but it is a landslide compared to the governor’s win in 2018 by less than a point.Crist also showed he was serious about the race when he announced he was quitting Congress to focus on the campaign. The former Republican governor-turned-Democrat made another big move when he named Karla Hernandez-Mats as his running mate.The DeSantis campaign lost no time blasting the head of the Miami-Dade teachers union for her opposition to DeSantis’ program that helps military veterans become schoolteachers, making a commercial using a clip of her bashing military veteran teachers on MSNBC.“It’s the way he supports them. This is them–deprofessionalizing our careers. Teachers have gone to school for four years. They have their bachelors. They have masters. They have doctoral degrees, and to think that somebody that has four years of combat experience would do well in our schools is actually very disrespectful to our educators, to our teachers,” Hernandez-Mats said in the clip.DeSantis has repeatedly said he is pushing left-wing ideology out of Florida schools, and Karla Hernandez-Mats is one of the ones pushing it back in.This earned her the moniker from the DeSantis campaign: “Karla Marx.”TOPICS:Charlie CristelectionfauciFloridaKarine Jean-PierreKarla MarxMiami DadeNeil W.

(AP Photo/David Longstreath, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:33 PM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022The passing of former USSR leader Mikhail Gorbachev has started a debate over his legacy amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The death of Mikhail Gorbachev, which was reported on the Russian Newswires on Wednesday evening, sparked a renewed debate of Russia’s past and future. The former President remained a polarizing figure in Russian society over his role in the demise of the Soviet Empire. His passing at the age of 91 marked the end of an era that changed the history of Russia and the world. “We need more enterprise, more democracy, more organization and discipline, then we will be able to bring Perestroika up to full speed and give new impetus to developing socialism,” Gorbachev said.Upon his appointment as the CPSU General-Secretary in 1985, Gorbachev became the youngest official to lead the Communist Party and the Country. At the time he was only 54-years-old and his promise of accelerating the economy, de-escalating international tensions and cracking down on alcohol consumption laid the foundation for a new course for Russia known as Perestroika. “I’ll tell you this, nowadays there are no firing cannons, and bombs are not exploding, but we live in very important times,” Gorbachev remarked.Just six-years later, the Soviet economy grounded to a halt. The country disassembled into 16-separate-republics and the Red Empire was no more. It was an experience that is still seen as traumatizing in Russian society. In international affairs, Gorbachev, along with President Ronald Reagan achieved what seemed impossible only a few years prior. During the Perestroika, the Soviet Union and the United States struck a number of arms-control treaties along with mutual agreements to improve relations and reduce tensions. Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev has passed away.Click the link below to view more photographs from his summits and meetings with #PresidentReagan.https://t.co/GoupwKnory pic.twitter.com/kF7apjcQ8M— RonaldReaganLibrary (@Reagan_Library) August 30, 2022The Accords were seen as gestures of goodwill at the time. However, they have since be proven to disrupt the balance of power in the world leading to the expansion of NATO in Europe and arguably the current crisis in Ukraine. The economic and social turmoil resulting from Perestroika largely subsided by the year 2000. Presidential terms of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev marked a rebound of the Russian economy. The nation was globally recognized as the successor of the Soviet Union and it began to restore its international influence. It was an effort that was met with stiff resistance from the Western World. “The NATO documents it officially we are declared the main threat… and we don’t want to believe that, but this is so,” Putin said.Despite Gorbachev’s best efforts to preserve the Soviet Union by reforming it, his methods of diplomacy and economic-and-political-compromise did not work to the country’s benefit. Today, the Russian government says it’s working to restore what was lost in the Perestroika turmoil with methods different than Gorbachev’s.","Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev addresses a group of 150 business executives in San Francisco, Monday, June 5, 1990.

While speaking on Bush-era Communications Director Nichole Wallace’s MSNBC show on Thursday, Brennan said it was “bizarre” that Trump took the particular documents he took to Mar-a-Lago. This comes despite the DOJ and FBI releasing a heavily redacted affidavit on the raid of Trump’s home. It has not been indicated what was actually seized.Brennan is currently being targeted in the Durham probe into the Crossfire Hurricane operation. The operation tried to get to the bottom of the Obama White House, CIA and the FBI’s efforts to spread the Russia collusion narrative.“I’m sure that Mar-a-Lago was being targeted by Russian intelligence and other intelligence services over the last 18 to 20 months,” Brennan said. “If they were able to get individuals into that facility and access those rooms where the documents were and made copies of those documents, that is what they would do. They wouldn’t steal the documents, they would make copies, and they would put them back exactly where they were. So now the intelligence community has to try to determine if they were compromised.”In the meantime, the Trump legal team is trying to get a special master appointed to the case against him. Critics warn that the Biden DOJ will not fairly review the evidence.","WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 23: Former Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) John Brennan testifies before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on Capitol Hill, May 23, 2017 in Washington, DC.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-687321060.jpg, House Minority Leader McCarthy: Biden Doesn’t Understand Soul Of AmericaTOPICS:CIADOJFBIJohn BrennanMar-a-LagonewsOANOANNpolitics SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/john-brennan-claims-russia-spied-on-mar-a-lago/

The agency noted that at least 97 people nationwide have been infected with an outbreak of a strain of the virus.While it has yet to be confirmed, many of the infected said they ate sandwiches from the fast-food restaurant which contained romaine lettuce before becoming sick. Victims in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana have all reported symptoms of E. coli. Their symptoms include bloody stool, stomach cramps and other gastrointestinal issues. Ebone Colbert, a woman who is a victim to these symptoms, spoke about her recent experience with the virus.“The doctor told me if I had tried to fight this off at home, I could have died, actually,” Colbert said. “Tuesday morning around 5 a.m., I started having bloody diarrhea and called my doctor and he told me to go to the emergency room. I did get a call from the state of Michigan Health Department. They told me it was E. coli and they didn’t know where it came from.”In response, Wendy’s released a statement announcing they had removed what they believed to be the affected products. The fast-food company also noted that they are cooperating with authorities in the investigation. Wendy’s is currently facing several outbreak related lawsuits.",AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/wendy-e1633110390713.jpg, Calif.

Lawmakers scrambled to pass hundreds of new bills before its end.Assembly Bill 2098 is the first of many measures heading to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk. The bill would allow the State Medical Board to discipline physicians spreading so-called COVID-19 misinformation. Opponents of the bill argued that it infringes on doctor’s freedom of speech.The Legislature has passed AB 2098 to punish doctors who spread COVID ""misinformation."" The bill doesn't account for all the misinformation that turned out to be true.— Kevin Kiley (@KevinKileyCA) August 30, 2022The California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act was also passed. The Act is the first of its kind in America. The bipartisan bill is modeled after laws in the United Kingdom that took effect in 2021. It will require companies such as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to install “guardrails” for users under the age of 18. That includes not collecting location data for minors.Lawmakers also passed Senate Bill 846. The bill keeps the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant open until 2030. That date is five years beyond the shutdown date that was scheduled prior. Six of the Governor’s seven climate and energy bills were able to pass, including new restrictions for oil and gas drilling.On the other hand, multiple controversial bills were dropped or failed to pass. Senate Bill 866 would have allowed teens to get a vaccine without parental consent. It was pulled because it didn’t receive enough votes.Senate Bill 866 to allow minors to consent to vaccines without parental permission will not move forward this year, with Sen. @Scott_Wiener saying Wednesday that it remained short votes heading into the final day of the legislative session.— Melody Gutierrez (@MelodyGutierrez) August 31, 2022Senate Bill 918 also failed to pass after its third attempt. The bill would have strengthened the Golden State’s conceal carry laws. Meanwhile, Governor Newsom has until the end of September to sign or veto measures sent to his desk.",(David Paul Morris/Getty Images),https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-2576287-1020x664-671x437.jpg, Herschel Walker Leads In Senate PollTOPICS:2022ACTbillCalif.CaliforniaGavin NewsomlawmakerslegislaturenewsNewsomOANOANNpolitics SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/calif-passes-a-slew-of-new-bills-in-2022-legislative-session/

(J. Scott Applewhite, File/AP Photo)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:04 AM PT – Friday, September 2, 2022House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is taking Democrats to task for their track record over the past year and a half. The California lawmaker specifically blasted Joe Biden, saying the President doesn’t understand the soul of America.On Thursday, McCarthy held a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania ahead of Biden’s Philadelphia address to feign national unity. He accused Biden of attempting to distract from the problems his reign has created rather than solving them. The GOP leader scoffed at the Biden administration’s push for so-called green energy, while their fossil fuel policies have pulverized the working class.“He inherited energy independence from President Trump, but is now traveling the world begging foreign countries for energy to power our country,” he noted. “We have God given American-made energy we need right here, right now, but Joe Biden has locked it away and raised the price of gas.”McCarthy zeroed in on the administration’s pledge to allow equity to guide every policy decision made by the White House. The Republican dared to ask how that idealistic goal has been achieved.“Is it fair that historic inflation is causing Americans to get second jobs or go into credit card debt to pay for groceries or to drive their daughter to get chemotherapy?” he asked. “Of course, it is not. It’s cruel and honest Americans know this.”However, McCarthy claimed Biden doesn’t particularly care for certain Americans. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Americans who do not hold an allegedly majority opinion are “extreme.” She asserted Biden’s targeting of “MAGA office holders” would not be a political speech. McCarthy challenged the White House’s rhetoric, however, while claiming the self-proclaimed “great unifier” owes half the population an apology.﻿﻿The Republican asserted Mr. Biden’s soul of America represents Washington insiders and elitists. To McCarthy, America’s soul can be found in the people that built this nation and propel it into the future.","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responds to reporters at the Capitol in Washington D.C.
