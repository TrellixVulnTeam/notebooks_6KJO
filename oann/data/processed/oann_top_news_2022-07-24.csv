6:00 PM PT",YouTube censor videos containing ‘abortion misinformation’,"YouTube is taking its censorship efforts to the issue of abortion. On Thursday, the video sharing platform said it would crackdown on videos containing so-called misinformation about abortion. This could include videos providing instructions on unsafe abortions or information false claims about abortion safety.1/ Starting today and ramping up over the next few weeks, we will remove content that provides instructions for unsafe abortion methods or promotes false claims about abortion safety under our medical misinformation policies. https://t.co/P7A27WPYuD— YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) July 21, 20223/ We’re also launching an information panel that provides viewers with context and information from local and global health authorities under abortion-related videos and above relevant search results. pic.twitter.com/dGzEn4bIb8— YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) July 21, 2022Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America responded to the news with a statement to Fox News Digital saying, “Videos sharing instructions for dangerous self-managed abortions are deeply concerning and a threat to the health and safety of women as well as their developing child. We are glad YouTube has decided to review this type of content and hope they will take appropriate action.”The Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade has increased pressure on technology companies to take steps so that their devices and digital services can’t be used to shadow women seeking abortions or steer them in directions that could threaten their health.This comes as progressive lawmakers are pushing parent-company Google to limit alleged instances of people searching for abortion clinics and being sent to pregnancy centers. Earlier this month, Google announced it will automatically purge information about users who visit abortion clinics or other places that could trigger legal problems in light of the Supreme Court’s court ruling.","FILE PHOTO: YouTube app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:45 AM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022The Supreme Court declined to allow the Biden administration to enforce a policy prioritizing the apprehension and deportation of certain groups of illegal immigrants. In a five-to-four decision Thursday, the high court rejected a request by the administration to put a district court ruling blocking the policies implementation on hold.Under the policy, border officials are instructed to focus on deporting suspected terrorists, people who have committed serious crimes and those caught at the border. Thursday’s decision means the rule will not take effect while the court hears arguments in the administrations appeal and eventually issues a final decision.This comes as the Transportation Security Administration admitted to allowing more than 1,000 illegal migrants to use Department of Homeland Security documents to board domestic flights. During a Senate hearing Thursday, officials from the TSA said they allowed migrants to present items like arrest warrants and deportation notices as a form of identification at its checkpoints. They also admitted to using Border Patrol databases to verify the legitimacy of the documents.Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) commented on this revelation.“Under your tenureship the time’s for screening have gone up, up, up at airports all across the country, including in my home state of Missouri,” stated the lawmaker. “St. Louis is not the sixth longest screening process in the country despite the size of our airport there. People who have done absolutely nothing wrong, who are law-abiding citizens and in every respect are subject to the most invasive screenings at these airports. Yet, you are allowing illegal aliens to present warrant for arrest and waiving them on the airplanes. How does that make sense?”﻿Meanwhile, 10 Republican senators have sent a letter to the DHS demanding an explanation over the policy.","FILE – The Supreme Court is seen at sundown in Washington, on Nov. 6, 2020.

In a 228-to-195 vote Thursday, lawmakers passed legislation that guarantees the federal right to contraception. Eight Republicans voted in favor of the bill, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) , Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). Rep. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio) and Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) took no position on the bill.NEW:The House passes the Right to Contraception Act by a vote of 228-195, two members voting present— Stephanie Myers (@_StephanieMyers) July 21, 2022The measure aims to protect a person’s ability to access contraceptives and engage in contraception and also protects healthcare providers. This comes after the Supreme Courts’ Roe v. Wade reversal and Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should revisit other decisions such as Griswold vs. Connecticut, which allows access to contraception.“The Supreme Court’s decision was a direct attack on abortion and Americans are now justifiably scared about the future of birth control,” stated Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.). “Republicans across this country will continue their extreme assault on basic freedoms and Justice Thomas made it clear that the Supreme Court will do nothing to protect our fundamental rights from these coordinated attacks.”Republicans, on the other hand, said the push from Democrats is unnecessary. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said contraception likely needs protection from Congress rather than by Congress, adding “if there is any entity you don’t want involved” in contraception choices “it’s the federal government.”Others claim it’s just another pointless bill to entice fear and rile up voters before the midterms. Meanwhile, Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) said it could be dangerous.“The kindest thing I can say about this legislation is that it is duplicative and unnecessary,” he stated. “But unfortunately, it can also be damaging. Contraception is so broadly defined that it could guarantee access to medical abortion pills or even contraceptives that might not have FDA approval.”This came shortly after the House passed a bill codifying gay marriage nationwide. It’s unclear whether both legislations will make it to President Joe Biden’s desk.","Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., makes a point during an event with Democratic women House members and advocates for reproductive freedom ahead of the vote on the Right to Contraception Act, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, July 20, 2022.

In a video posted to Twitter Thursday, she used a graph to show declining gas prices over the past month.This attempt to downplay the issue came after the national average hit more than $5 a gallon in June. While prices have dropped since then, the current national average of $4.41 is still about $2 higher than when President Joe Biden first took office.Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre explains what you need to know about the decline in gas prices over the past month. pic.twitter.com/QpwaQECsH3— The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 22, 2022Jean-Pierre said gas prices aren’t coming down as fast as oil prices, but she claimed gas should continue to decline in the upcoming months. Meanwhile, Biden has refused to take credit for any of the economic woes facing the country that have taken place during his presidency. He has often blamed Russia for the pain at the pump, however,  prices had already risen a dollar per gallon prior to the invasion of Ukraine.Over the past year, fuel prices across the US surged more than 60 percent. Economists have said recent retreat in US gas prices happened due to fears of recession and the degradation of demand. Some claimed Biden actually had nothing to do with it.A March study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank found found half of the inflation rate in quarter four of last year had been triggered by bloated pandemic spending packages. Nonetheless, the Biden administration seems to be telling Americans to be grateful for a slight decline in gas prices as the population continues to feel pain in their pockets.","The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is shown behind the gasoline price board of a gas station in San Francisco, Wednesday, July 20, 2022.

(AP Photo/Claire Rush)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:45 PM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022Rising gun-related homicides in Portland, Oregon have spurred a response from Mayor Ted Wheeler (D). Wheeler announced a new initiative to combat rising homicides in the city. During a Thursday press conference, he unveiled the safer summer PDX 2022 which will allocate $2.4 million to helping the local government along with several non-profit organizations in establishing community-focused intervention programs and improve response times to shootings.Additionally, he said it will re-prioritize work within city bureaus to quell shootings, such as identifying areas where they are the most prevalent and modifying the traffic flow to the area or increasing the lighting. Prior to this, the Democrat mayor cut a significant amount of funds from the city’s police in response to mounting pressure from anti-police activists in the wake of George Floyd’s death.“Today, I’m presenting a two year evidence based plan called safer summer PDX,” said Wheeler. “This plan is specific and it provides actionable goals to better coordinate existing resources and activates an additional $2.4 million to near-term community based violence interventions.”Wheeler then went on to outline what he expects his plan will do about the city’s homicide rate.“Safer summer PDX is accompanied by an emergency declaration that will implement the plan in an agile, accountable, coordinated and fairer manner, reducing Portland’s gun violence by at least 10 percent over the next two years,” he stated.STATE OF EMERGENCY: Mayor Ted Wheeler's message directly to those involved in Portland's gun violence crisis:""We do not choose the lives that we are born into… We are sincere in wanting to offer you a path out."" pic.twitter.com/bu9xA4Eaq5— Wesleigh Ogle KATU (@WesleighOgle) July 22, 2022This comes as Portland experienced a 241 percent increase in non-fatal shootings over the past two years with another study saying the city saw a 144 percent increase in gun-related murders between 2019 and 2021, but Wheeler is promising to bring peace back to the city.“Until Portland’s gun murders stop, we won’t stop,” he voiced. “We won’t stop until we get justice for more gun violence victims and their families. We won’t stop until we bring peace back to those Portland neighborhoods that are too often caught in the crossfire.”Wheeler said that because Portland has a decentralized governmental structure, the plan will bring all agencies that can address gun violence together.","Mayor Ted Wheeler makes an announcement of a new initiative to combat surging gun violence in Oregon’s largest city on Thursday, July 21, 2022, in Portland, Ore.

Melania said on Thursday that she was taking archival photographs of the White House renovations on January 6, 2021 with a team of photographers she commissioned months prior.She added that she was unaware of events at the Capitol Building because she was fulfilling the duties of the First Lady. This comes after her former Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham claimed the First Lady did not immediately sign off on a statement condemning the Capitol protest.“As with all First Ladies who preceded me, it was my obligation to record the contents of the White House’s historic rooms, including taking archival photographs of all the renovations,” Trump said. “Several months in advance I organized a qualified team of photographers, archivists and designers to work with me in the White House to ensure perfect execution. As required, we scheduled January 6, 2021 to complete the work on behalf of our Nation.” It was not until January 11, five days after the insurrection, that Trump in part condemned the violence. According to Grisham, she sent Trump a text that said “Do you want to tweet that peaceful protests are the right of every American, but there is no place for lawlessness and violence?” Trump replied with “No.”“Knowing her as well as I did at that point it was so unlike her to not have condemned it,” Grisham voiced. “That was the moment it all kind of broke me. Yesterday, hearing Cassidy’s testimony I felt compelled to show that text because it was a lot of context I thought and again knowing Melania like I did I was so disappointed and discouraged and sickened that she wouldn’t stand up and just say simply, ‘There should be no violence.’”Melania Trump blames her former chief of staff @OMGrisham for not keeping her up to date.Here’s the text that Grisham sent to her that day. pic.twitter.com/Cxo7QYWFll— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) July 21, 2022Grisham was a loyal Trump deputy for more than five years.

In a post on Truth Social Friday, Trump expressed his support for the Republican candidate hoping to unseat the Democrat incumbent Gov. Tony Evers (D-Wis.).“Wisconsin needs a governor who will stop inflation, uphold the rule of law, strengthen our borders and end the well-documented fraud in our elections,” Trump said. “Tim Michels is the best candidate to deliver meaningful solutions to these problems and he will produce jobs like no one else can even imagine.”He emphasized Michel’s experience serving under his administration on the infrastructure task force. Trump was also critical of Ever’s mishandling of the COVID pandemic and the rise of crime in the state. The endorsement gives Trump a chance to claim bragging rights in Wisconsin, two years after he narrowly lost the state and two years before he could be on the ballot again.“I appreciate President Trump’s endorsement and vote of confidence,” Michels voiced. “This is a tremendous boost to our efforts and a continuation of our astounding surge since I entered the race.”Donald Trump just sent out this statement, which appears to be the exact same one he sent when he endorsed Tim Michels last month. pic.twitter.com/yJny3RC0EL— Jessie Opoien (@jessieopie) July 22, 2022The 45th president said Michels was the best candidate to provide solutions for these problems.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:53 PM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022A Kentucky judge continues to block the state’s near-total ban on abortions. On Friday, Judge Mitch Perry extended his June order which blocked the state from enforcing its so-called “trigger law” that bans abortions after six weeks.The ruling claimed the law would violate residents right to privacy and self determination. Finding significant state constitutional questions about the two laws, Perry ordered them blocked until the dispute is resolved at trial. A trial date has not been set.“Once again, the courts have rightly stopped Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s relentless efforts to ban abortion, which would have devastating consequences for Kentuckians,” said a Planned Parenthood spokesperson. “No one should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will or flee the state to access essential health care. Kentuckians have a right to abortion under the state constitution and we’ll continue fighting for that right so that every person in the commonwealth can get the care they need.”BREAKING: A Kentucky state court has granted our request to block enforcement of abortion bans as our lawsuit continues.Abortion remains legal in Kentucky and people can still get an abortion in Kentucky.— ACLU of Kentucky (@ACLUofKY) July 22, 2022Cameron, a Republican who has been seeking to enforce the two laws and other abortion legislation enacted by the GOP-controlled General Assembly, issued a statement that he was “disappointed” with Perry’s ruling and planned to appeal.“The judge’s suggestion that Kentucky’s constitution contains a right to abortion is not grounded in the text and history of our state’s governing document,” Cameron voiced. “We will continue our steadfast defense of these bipartisan laws that represent the commonwealth’s commitment to the lives of the unborn.”Perry’s order found that “the fundamental right for a woman to control her own body free from government interference” outweighs the state’s interest in protecting a fetus before it is viable. In his order, Perry was determined that abortion services are health care, a point disputed by abortion opponents.“Plaintiffs assert and this court agrees, that abortion is a form of health care,” the judge stated. “It is provided by licensed medical professionals in licensed medical facilities, just like many other medical procedures.”In the meantime, Cameron continues to vow to fight this decision at the appellate level.","Supporters of abortion rights chant slogans outside a Planned Parenthood clinic during a protest in West Hollywood, Calif., Friday, June 24, 2022.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:53 PM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022President Biden touted falling gas prices. During a virtual meeting with his economic team Friday, Biden said gas prices have fallen every day this summer for a consecutive 38 days. The average price at the pump topped $5 nationwide in June and according to Biden gas is just under $4 in over 35 states. He said the US is producing 12 million barrels of oil a day and is on track to near record highs, but claimed prices of oil and gas aren’t coming down fast enough.Tune in as I meet virtually with my economic team on how gas prices are coming down for American families. https://t.co/ogpWg6fsJb— President Biden (@POTUS) July 22, 2022“I’ve been working to make sure that when the price of oil comes down, the price at the pump comes down as well and comes down in real time,” Biden said during the meeting. “The good news is that’s happening, but it’s not happening fast enough. We’ve made progress, but prices are still too high.”Biden said his administration will be looking at ways to increase oil production from existing wells and permits. He called on the US oil industry to do its part as well.“My message to these companies is use the permits or lose them,” he voiced. “Secondly, I’m telling the industry: you’re making record profits due to Putin’s war in Ukraine. Use those profits to increase production and refining. Don’t use those profits to buy back your stocks and dividends.”Biden said while he plans to continue his efforts to keep gas prices falling in the US, the longer term answer is a “clean energy economy” that focuses on renewable energy and more affordable electric vehicles.Biden affirmed his administration will continue working on ways to increase oil production from existing wells and permits.","The price of regular unleaded gas is advertised for just under $4 a gallon at a Woodman’s, Wednesday, July 20, 2022, in Menomonie Falls, Wis.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:15 PM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022“I stand with Trump and the Constitution. Thank you very much.” — Steve BannonFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon reaffirmed his innocence on charges of ignoring a subpoena issued by the January 6 Committee. Attorneys representing Bannon concluded his defense on Thursday and made a motion for the presiding judge to acquit their client before jury deliberation begins.Bannon attorney Evan Corcoran had originally requested a direct acquittal, arguing the Department of Justice failed to present an adequate case against his client. Attorney David Schoen echoed these sentiments while claiming Bannon’s legal team was in active negotiations with the so-called select committee rather than ignoring their summon.“He told them from the very first letter he would comply if they go before a judge and the judge orders him, no orders that the executive privilege wasn’t valid,” said Schoen. “As simple as that. He’s not someone who thought he was above the law ever. He’s not someone who ignored a subpoena at all times and communicated with them.”Bannon himself reiterated he had previously been bound to silence by former President Donald Trump’s executive privilege and has cooperated with authorities in multiple other manners. He also took the time to call out the panel’s chair, Bennie Thompson.During the trial, the defense called no witnesses and introduced no new evidence. This came after the judge ruled their arguments on executive privilege or the political bias of the January 6 Committee would not be heard.A verdict was reached Friday and a D.C. court found Bannon guilty. He was charged with criminal contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee Investigating January 6.Bannon did not take the stage and his defense did not present a case to the jury. The jury deliberated for around three hours. He will be sentenced October 21 and is now facing a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a $100,000 fine.","Former White House strategist Steve Bannon, left, speaks with reporters as he departs federal court on Tuesday, July 19, 2022, in Washington.
