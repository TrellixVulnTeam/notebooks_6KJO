11:26 AM PT",Biden immigration policies under scrutiny after migrant deaths in Texas,"President Joe Biden’s policies are under scrutiny after more than 51 migrants were found dead in San Antonio, Texas in an apparent human smuggling operation. As officials are investigating the cause of the deaths, which took place in a tractor-trailer, officials are certain about one thing: the administration’s border policies are not working.After receiving reports of the incident, Texas Governor Greg Abbott lamented those deaths are on President Biden. He added, this event is a result of the President’s open border policies. Meanwhile, San Antonio’s Mayor Ron Nirenberg tried to be diplomatic with his comments on the incident, while stressing the tragedy of the situation.“We have been working to, you know, assist migrants who are here seeking asylum as we have throughout the year, every year,” said the Mayor. “We know that there’s been increasing volumes over the last six months, 12 months related to the, you know, the policies…our focus right now is to try to bring aid to them as as best we can, but this is nothing short of a horrific human tragedy.”On Monday, more than 40 migrants were found in or near an abandoned tractor trailer in what authorities hypothesize was a human smuggling operation. At the time, there were16 survivors who were taken to nearby hospitals. Some of them later died, in turn, bringing the death toll up to over 50.Roberto Marquez, of Dallas, adds a cross to a makeshift memorial at the site where officials found dozens of people dead in an abandoned semitrailer containing suspected migrants, Wednesday, June 29, 2022, in San Antonio. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)Even Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Oberador gave his condolences to the victims, adding the US-Mexico border is a “disgrace” and is “out of control.” He confirmed 22 of the dead victims were Mexican citizens. Lopez Obrador went on to blame bad public policy and opportunistic human smugglers for the incident.“These unfortunate events have to do with the situation of poverty and desperation of our Central American and Mexican brothers and sisters,” stated the Mexican President. “It happens because there is also human trafficking and lack of controls at the border between Mexico and the United States and inside the United States.”Critics have lambasted Biden’s border policies since he took office. The administration has overseen the largest surge of border violations in more than 20-years by migrants coming in through the southern border. Policies scrutinized under the microscope include his attempted reversal of the Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ and Title 42 policies that sought to keep migrants out of the US for health reasons or while their immigration applications were being processed.Biden also cut funding for border wall projects, prompting border states like Texas and Arizona to protect the federal border on their own and with only state resources. Additionally, as Biden looks to revoke Trump-era immigration policies, border agents fear an even bigger mass migration event may be on the horizon. Human rights officials also worry the failures at the southern border will only encourage more migrants to take the dangerous journey to the land of the free.“(Migrants) pay $8,000-12,000, those who died were also paying, but they remain to pay for five, ten years,” explained Luis Garcia Villagran, migrant rights activist and director at Human Dignity Center. “That is the new slavery those politicians have invented.”Meanwhile, President Biden commented and suggested criticizing him for his border policies is “grandstanding” and is tantamount to what the human smugglers are doing. He also stressed his proposed anti-smuggling campaign with what he called his “regional partners is already underway and working. Biden claimed more than 2,400 smugglers were arrested as a result.The US President also expressed hope that his initiative will continue to bring smugglers to justice. However, his border czar, Kamala Harris, only offered thoughts to the victims and a promise to take action in a tweet.The loss of life in San Antonio is horrifying. My thoughts are with those who lost loved ones. Our Administration will continue to fight to hold those trying to exploit vulnerable people for profit, including human smugglers and traffickers, accountable.— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) June 28, 2022In the meantime, Biden is set to meet with Mexican President Lopez Obrador in mid-July after being recently snubbed by the socialist leader at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, California.","A makeshift memorial at the site where officials found dozens of people dead in an abandoned semitrailer containing suspected migrants include flowers, water bottles and candles, Wednesday, June 29, 2022, in San Antonio.

(AP Photo/George Frey)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:16 AM PT – Wednesday, June 29, 2022The Trump endorsement has reaped substantial wins for Republican candidates across the country. This comes as general election match ups solidified in Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, New York and Illinois.In Utah, Sen. Mike Lee declared Republican voters had chosen freedom after he decimated his primary opponents after securing more than 60 percent of the vote. In November, the two-term senator is favored the win in his race against independent and 2016 presidential hopeful Evan McCullin who has been endorsed by a number of Utah Democrats .Meanwhile in neighboring Colorado, conservative firebrand Lauren Boebert thrashed her moderate challenger, state Sen. Don Coram, by nearly 30-points. She will take on former Aspen City Councilman Adam Frisch in November.“You don’t mess with God-fearing women who put their country first, who stand up for what’s right, will not bend over backwards to the establishment and let their people get run over,” Boebert exclaimed amid her primary victory speech. “Those days are over!”﻿Additionally, 2020 election skeptic Joe O’Dea will attempt to end incumbent Colorado Sen. Michael Bennett’s aspirations of attaining a third term.Meanwhile, Oklahoma saw no-nonsense conservative Sen. James Lankford take another step towards re-election, while Rep. Markwayne Mullin emerged from a special election primary to replace retiring Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe’s’ seat. Also, despite the controversy surrounding his pro-life governance, Governor Kevin Stitt has asserted his constituents are pleased with the current path of the sooner state.“I’m looking forward to seeing who my opponent is in the general and then having a great conversation with Oklahomans about the direction they want our state to go,” Stitt stated. “And I’m confident Oklahomans love the direction that we’re going.”Democrat New York Governor Kathy Hochul easily warded off challenges from NYC public advocate Jumaane Williams and Rep. Tom Suozzi. On the right side of the aisle, Rep. Lee Zeldin managed to defeat Andrew Giuliani with 43 percent of the vote for the Empire State’s GOP gubernatorial nomination.FILE — Lee Zeldin appears during New York’s Republican gubernatorial debate, at the studios of Spectrum News NY, June 20, 2022, in New York. (Brittainy Newman/Pool via AP, File)The biggest upset of the night came from Illinois, where state Sen. Darren Bailey won the state’s Republican governor primary despite the GOP establishment donating millions to his opponent’s campaign. Bailey’s toughest opponent, Richard Irvin, received $50 million from GOP donor and Citadel founder Ken Griffin. The dark horse candidate is looking to unseat Democrat Governor J.B. Pritzker, who he has been called the worst governor in America.“We were outspent my tens-of-millions of dollars in the primary and look what happened,” said Bailey. “This is how it’s done…here’s tip and some advice for J.B. Pritzker: start packing, friend.”Twelve Trump-endorsed candidates from Tuesday’s primaries will appear on general election ballots. His current primary election endorsement track record stands at a 93 percent success rate.","Sen.

On Tuesday, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the US-Mexico border is “out of control.”He further lamented 22 of the deceased were Mexican nationals while seven were reportedly from Guatemala and two from Honduras. Lopez Obrador claimed the surge of migrants going into the US is a result of poor economic policies affecting Central and South America as well as the entrepreneurship of human smugglers.“These unfortunate events have to do with the situation of poverty and desperation of our Central American and Mexican brothers and sisters,” stated the Mexican President. “It happens because there is also human trafficking and lack of controls at the border between Mexico and the United States and inside the United States.”And yet the US keep sending migrants to wait inside Mexico where they are easy prey to organized crime. https://t.co/7pu3X5ClyM— José Luis Granados Ceja (@GranadosCeja) June 28, 2022Lopez Obrador said he will meet with President Biden on July 12 to discuss migration.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:37 AM PT – Tuesday, June 28, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave the US Supreme Court an ‘A’ grade in effectiveness and the Biden administration an ‘F’ for far-left.  While speaking at a rotary club in Florence, Kentucky on Monday, he praised recent decisions in the Supreme Court that bolstered the Second Amendment and stripped federal protections created by Roe v. Wade. McConnell claimed the Dobbs decision on abortion was the correct decision because it takes away the power to legislate the issue from a deeply divided Congress.“In the Senate, most things require 60 votes, not just 51,” he noted. “Neither side of this issue has come anywhere close to having 60 votes, so I think this is likely to all be litigated out in the various states around the country through the democratic process.”Meanwhile, McConnell stressed President Joe Biden has turned the executive branch into a far left playground. He pointed out Biden has never been a moderate, but claimed to be because he was running against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) for the Democrat presidential nomination.Since taking office, McConnell said Biden has shown his true colors. The GOP lawmaker vowed to stop him from further tilting America to the left when Republicans take back the Senate.“So, if I’m majority leader, we’ll be really picky on appointments,” said McConnell. “There’s 12,000 executive branch appointments that come to us. They’re not all as important as the Supreme Court, but many of them are quite important. They have to be confirmed by the Senate.”McConnell went on to say there’s still a chance for Biden to come back to the center if the predicted red wave crashes down in November. He then pointed out, Bill Clinton pulled back his sweeping agenda after the 1994 mid-term elections.In the meantime, McConnell asserted he will continue trying to center the Biden administration. Additionally, the Senate Minority Leader said he will compromise with Democrats on several issues like he did with raising the debt ceiling, infrastructure and gun control. However, he said the fate of America is up to the American people who will be giving Biden his ultimate midterm report card this November.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022.

He admitted there’s no guarantee for so-called “soft landing” and a recession is possible.While speaking at a European Central Bank Forum in Portugal on Wednesday, Powell said he couldn’t guarantee that the Federal Reserve can bring inflation back down while also retaining a strong labor market. This means interest rates will continue to go up, which may cause an increase in unemployment.The Fed chair also added, he’s committed to utilizing every tool at his disposal to ensure economic stability, although he admitted there’s a risk for the Fed going too far and triggering a recession. His remarks came after the US Central Bank raised interest rates in an attempt to curb inflation.“We think that there are pathways for us to achieve the path back to 2 percent inflation while still retaining a strong labor market,” Powell stated. “We believe we can do that. That is our aim. There’s no guarantee that we can do that.”His comments come as the Consumer Confidence Index dropped by 4.5 points this week. US consumers are expecting economic growth to “significantly weaken” in the second half of this year. This drop has been attributed to a number of reasons such as rising costs for basic necessities, supply chain problems and concerns about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Today, Chair Powell confirmed: @federalreserve's interest rate hikes won't bring down gas and food prices for families.But they could throw millions of out of their jobs, trigger a recession, and drive our economy off a cliff. pic.twitter.com/sD3fzn4KrZ— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 22, 2022“We’re strongly committed to using our tools to get inflation to come down,” said Powell. “The way to do that is to slow down growth, ideally keeping it positive. Is there a risk that would go too far? Certainly, there’s a risk.”Economists are saying the probability of the US experiencing a broad economic crisis is rising and could possibly occur in 2023 or even sooner. In the meantime, Biden still insists a recession is not inevitable, despite worsening projections by economists.Biden burying his head in the sand and denying that a recession is coming will not solve the problem.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:33 AM PT – Thursday, June 30, 2022The suspected driver of the truck carrying dozens of migrants has been arrested alongside his alleged conspirator. The alleged driver was located Wednesday hiding near the area where the abandoned truck was found. This came after two Mexican nationals were arrested for their involvement in the incident that left 53 migrants dead from extreme heat.If convicted, all four suspects could face life in a federal prison or the death penalty. A San Antonio judge has ordered them to remain in custody while they wait for their preliminary hearing, which is scheduled for Friday. Meanwhile, families back home in Mexico are awaiting news of loved ones who they fear may be among those who died in that tractor trailer.This comes after dozens of migrants were found trapped in a tractor trailer that tipped over on a highway in San Antonio, Texas with some survivors being transported to area hospitals in varying conditions. The events unfolded on a sweltering day with temperatures reaching 100-degrees outside. Officials said there was no working AC or signs of water in the truck.President Joe Biden’s policies are under scrutiny following the apparent human smuggling operation. Republicans have called this tragedy another example of the current administration’s open border policies with no deterrence in the US immigration system.Horrified at the tragic loss of life near San Antonio. This speaks to the desperation of migrants who would put their lives in the hands of callous human smugglers who show no regard for human life. We’ll be working w/ our partners to assist in every way w/ the investigation.— CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus (@CBPChrisMagnus) June 28, 2022San Antonio Mayor, Ron Nirenberg lamented at the human toll accumulated by traffickers taking advantage of people in need.“So I would urge you all to think compassionately and pray for the deceased, the ailing, the families,” he noted. “And we hope that those responsible for putting these people in such inhumane conditions are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”The incident is not the first human smuggling tragedy San Antonio has witnessed. Back in 2017, 10 migrants perished while trapped inside a truck at a Walmart parking lot. Additionally, the bodies of 19 migrants were found inside a vehicle during a heat wave back in 2003.Critics have lambasted Biden’s border policies since he took office. The administration has overseen the largest surge of border violations in more than 20-years by migrants coming in through the southern border. Policies scrutinized under the microscope include his attempted reversal of the Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ and Title 42 policies that sought to keep migrants out of the US for health reasons or while their immigration applications were being processed.","Mourners visit a make-shift memorial at the site where dozens of suspected migrants died in an abandoned tractor-trailer, Thursday, June 30, 2022, in San Antonio.

(Photo by Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:12 AM PT – Thursday, June 30, 2022Texas Governor Greg Abbott is taking further steps to rein in the crisis at the southern border. The Republican recently addressed the recent horrific finding at the southern border, a truck filled with deceased migrant, and demanded action be taken.“Under President Trump, we saw the fewest illegal crossings in decades,” he stated. “Under President Biden we see all-time record highs.”In a press conference on Wednesday, Abbott said the truck carrying the migrants had to have travel through a checkpoint, but likely passed unchecked due to limited Border Patrol resources.“Many of these deaths could’ve been prevented if Biden simply fully funded the Border Patrol operation of the United States of America and implemented the policies that the Border Patrol needs in order to do the real job,” asserted the Governor. “…The real job is both to secure the border as well as to do things like inspect the vehicle that was carrying those people who lost their lives.”Abbott further urged the Biden administration to reinstate Trump-era policies like finishing the wall and re-implementing remain in Mexico. He highlighted the efforts of his own state while suggesting Texas is doing more than any state in history, including building its own wall and boosting security at the border.“DPS (Department of Public Safety) will create and implement a checkpoint strategy beginning immediately where they will begin targeting trucks like the one that was used where these people perished,” said Abbott. “To make sure that we will have a better capability of perhaps stopping future trucks like that, as well as stopping the smugglers and the cartel members who are trying to profiteer off of it.”Joined state & local officials in Eagle Pass to announce the expansion of Texas’ ongoing border security operations. @TxDPS @TXMilitaryThe Lone Star State will not sit idly by as President Biden ignores the crisis at our southern border. https://t.co/RJQFtQcOXK— Gov.

The Florida Department of Health is doubling down on its opposition to gender reassignment treatment for underage patients amid a spat with Levine.In a statement Tuesday, Florida officials reiterated experimental and irreversible medical treatments must not be provided to children and teenagers -who suffer from gender dysphoria. This comes after last week’s testimony by Levine, the first transgender cabinet official in history, who painted the Florida Health Department out to be an opponent of LGBTQ equality.The event, called the Pride Month Town Hall, was recently live-streamed by the DNC. During that discussion, Levine promoted gender-transitioning for minors and referred to transgender treatments as an “age appropriate” and a “critical tool.” It was during that event when the admiral suggested that the Florida Health Department was against the LGBTQ community and claimed opponents of gender-transitions for minors are “targeting trans youth to score political points.”Biden official Rachel Levine: Sex reassignment surgery and puberty blockers for KIDS is “lifesaving, medically necessary, age appropriate, and a critical tool” pic.twitter.com/OwSOA3cjj8— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 27, 2022The department fired back at Levine while taking issue with her claims that “this makes anyone at the department an “opponent of LGBTQ equality,” also adding that her comments are “nothing more than a poorly attempted character assassination.” Levine has yet to respond to the rebuttal by Florida officials. Meanwhile, Florida’s surgeon general is recommending other states to prohibit children’s access to “disfiguring” gender surgery.","Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health, Adm.

Salah Abdeslam was convicted for crimes of terrorism and murder with no possibility of parole on Wednesday, which is the most severe criminal sentence possible in France.According to the investigation, Abdeslam is only alive because his explosive vest malfunctioned during his attempted suicide attack. This refutes his claims he had purposefully not done so, even apologizing to the victims during the trial who were contented with its outcome.“I am extremely satisfied of the sentences given, I think they are really at the level of what the state should do to protect itself from these types of individuals,” said Olivier Fischer, survivor of attack on Le Carillon Café. “It’s a very clear message addressed to all people who are tempted by the experience of radical Islamism.” Salah Abdeslam, the one surviving #IS attacker in custody from the November 2015 rampage in #France that murdered 130 people, has ""received a rare full-life sentence"" after a nine-month trial. 19 others were convicted; 6 of whom are believed to be dead. https://t.co/boep82fmOx pic.twitter.com/fqrrDv0rsb— Kyle Orton (@KyleWOrton) June 30, 2022Although already deceased, 19 other accomplices were also found guilty for their role in the attacks.","FILE – This undated image made available by Belgium Federal Police shows Salah Abdeslam, the leading suspect and the only surviving member of the nine-member attacking team that terrorized Paris, in Paris on Nov. 13, 2015.
