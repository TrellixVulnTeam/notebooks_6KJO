3:56 PM PT","Iowa reports first Monkeypox case, US cases top 460","Health officials in Iowa have reported the first case of Monkeypox in their state amid ongoing spread of the infection. According to the Iowa HHS, the first probable case of Monkeypox was identified last week and the patient’s contacts are being traced right now. Officials said the patient was likely infected during their recent international travel and is now isolating in their home.The Biden administration has come under fire over its slow response to the outbreak. The CDC has reported 460 cases of Monkeypox across the US, with some states rolling out Monkeypox vaccines. The CDC suggests the smallpox vaccine is at least 85 percent effective against Monkeypox.🔔Breaking: New York state will receive 8,195 doses of the Jynneos vaccine for #monkeypox, of which 5,989 will go to New York City. No word yet on when the doses will be available, but ""soon"" is the general idea from CDC.— Benjamin Ryan (@benryanwriter) June 30, 2022“What’s happening right now here in New York city is that there are not enough doses,” said a patient outside a vaccination tent in New York City. “I believe we will have enough in a couple of weeks. This is a city that is always looking for solutions and we do all we have to do in order to stay healthy. I believe we will have enough vaccines in a few days.”The disease is spread through close contact with an infected animal or person, generally through lesions, body fluids or respiratory droplets. Unlike the coronavirus, Monkeypox droplets travel only up to a few feet and usually require prolonged contact for transmission.“Risk to the general public is low,” the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services stated. “But anyone with a rash that looks like Monkeypox should talk to their healthcare provider. Even if they don’t think they had contact with someone who has Monkeypox.”#HCP: Do you or your patients have questions about #monkeypox? We have answers!

In a statement on Monday, the Putin administration said “congratulations this year can hardly be considered appropriate.”Russian officials cited “unfriendly policies” by the Biden administration as the main reason to deviate from the diplomatic protocol. This after Biden’s officials made questionable accusations against Russia and Russians, which the Kremlin said were unfair and unjustified.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian Air Forces wished President Joe Biden and the US a happy Fourth of July despite Putin’s opinion.“Happy Independence Day to the people of the US and POTUS!,” Zelensky tweeted. “I wish the friendly people of the US peace and prosperity.

The American Customer Satisfaction Index released this year’s ranking recently, in which Chick-Fil-A scored 83 points out of 100. The American Customer Satisfaction Index released this year’s rankings on Tuesday.“Amid the pandemic, restaurants needed to quickly up their game in the mobile arena,” said Forrest Morgeson, Assistant Professor of Marketing at Michigan State University and Director of Research Emeritus at the ACSI. “With fewer resources, smaller chains and independent restaurants are offering apps that aren’t making the grade per customers. In contrast, positive shifts in both mobile app quality and reliability for several larger chains appear to reflect major app updates for these bigger industry players,”#ChickfilA continues to lead the industry – and all restaurants – for the 8th straight year with a steady score of 83 (out of 100).Download our study to see how other fast food and full-service restaurants ranked in customer satisfaction: https://t.co/3udsQk6Ghb pic.twitter.com/XSvEQSbPEJ— The ACSI (@theACSI) June 30, 2022Chick-Fil-A led all restaurants overall and was also the winner in the fast food category. Behind Chick-Fil-A in second place in the fast food segment was Jimmy John’s, followed by Domino’s Pizza and KFC. Other high ranking franchises included Chipotle, Panera Bread, Pizza Hut and Starbucks.“We are honored by the results of this survey and we are grateful to our customers for choosing Chick-fil-A. It’s truly our pleasure to serve them,” a statement made by the company read.Chick-fil-A has become so popular that long lines at the drive-thru at some franchises have become a concern for communities. In California, the Santa Barbara City Council considered labeling a location a public nuisance over long lines that back up into nearby streets and caused traffic issues.The survey revealed that more Americans prefer sit-down dining over a fast food experience despite Chick-Fil-A’s win.","OAN NEWSROOM

Newark Police announced Monday that the 17-year-old male is facing several charges after he allegedly used a stolen vehicle during the shootout last week.When police arrived they found multiple people hurt ranging in ages from 17 to 68. Eight adults and one juvenile were sent to two local hospitals where they were treated for non-life threatening injuries.“Our goal is to bring each suspect involved to justice,” said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. “This was a very violent and troublesome incident that we are taking very, very, seriously.”According to the city’s gunfire detection system ShotSpotter, the police were alerted to the shooting which occurred outside a bodega shortly after 6 p.m. on the 200 block of Clinton Place.In an effort to curb summer violence, Baraka established the city’s Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery Safe Summer Academy in 2021. It was aimed to provide alternate paths for success to at-risk youth and adults exposed to the criminal justice system. The program will be running this summer as well.“If you decide that you want to resort to violence or use of guns in the streets of Newark, you will be caught,” he said.There’s no evidence at this time the incident was gang related, but approximately 60 percent of the violence in Newark stems from personal disputes.TOPICS:bodegamass shootingNEWARKnewsOANOANNtraumaviolence SHARETWEETPINSHARE",Crime scene police tape in front of blue and red police lights at night.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:12 AM PT – Tuesday, July 5, 2022GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) lamented that all civility is lost to Democrats when they don’t get their way.  During an interview over the weekend, she said Democrat tantrums include recent calls to change congressional rules to fit their agenda.The senator added, Democrats also threaten to defy the rules to enforce their demands. She mentioned the outcry over the recent Dobbs decision at the Supreme Court that has resulted in far-left activists calling for violent attacks on justices. Blackburn stressed when they don’t get their way, they usually take to the streets.“And what they would be doing is defying a Supreme Court decision and also they want to go around the Hyde Amendment, they want to go around Mexico City policy,” explained the lawmaker. “To them, it is imperative that they, the federal government, be able to control access to abortion. They do not want this to be sent to the states as the court has said. It is the jurisdiction of the states to set the regulation and restrictions around abortion, but for them that’s not good enough.”Blackburn suggested the left has chosen to weaponize the Dobbs decision “in their fearmongering campaign against the unborn.” However, she noted that move will help to create a culture that values life and empowers women.The Tennessee Republican also blamed Democrats for several failed policies that are devastating American communities, including President Joe Biden’s war on American energy and open border policies.Joe Biden should celebrate our nation’s independence by making us energy independent again.— Sen.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, July 4, 2022Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson (R) urged President Joe Biden to take immediate action to solve the inflation crisis. During an interview on Monday, the former physician to the last three presidents called on Biden to “stop playing the blame game when it comes to his economic mistakes.”“Biden is going to have to stop this,” Jackson said. “He’s going to have to stop blaming everybody but himself for what’s going on right now. He’s going to have to take some responsibility for what is happening and he’s going to have to do something to fix it.”The WITCH HUNT committee is a JOKE! The liberal media will do ANYTHING to push this Never-Trump SNOOZE-FEST, but nobody in REAL America cares! Where are the hearings on inflation, the open border, and baby formula? This whole thing is meant to DISTRACT from Biden’s failures!— Ronny Jackson (@RonnyJacksonTX) June 28, 2022The Congressman lamented Biden’s recent Twitter spat with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos over soaring gas prices. He claimed it has garnered praise from China’s government. Chinese officials suggested Biden’s anti-corporate stance mirror’s the CCP views.“I think when you have the leader of the free world, the President of the United States, and you have the premiere communist leader in the entire world praising him for his communist rhetoric, it speaks volumes,” Jackson declared. “I just think it doesn’t look good on the international stage the way the president has been criticized across the board and this is just another example of that.”Ouch. Inflation is far too important a problem for the White House to keep making statements like this. It’s either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics. https://t.co/XgKfEICZpk— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) July 3, 2022Jackson added that Biden’s war against American energy producers is making America weaker on the international stage.","Physician to the President U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson meets with Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-GA) in his office in the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill April 16, 2018 in Washington, DC.
