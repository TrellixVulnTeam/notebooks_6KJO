3:55 PM PT",WalkAway founder Brandon Straka recreates jailing to raise awareness of J6 prisoners,"DALLAS Conservatives at the CPAC held in Dallas, got a unique glimpse into the suffering of Jan. 6, participants targeted by federal law enforcement when WalkAway Campaign founder walked through the halls and exhibits in an orange jumpsuit as if in custody—leading a crowd to a jail cell.“I think that most people in the conservative movement through no faults of their own, don’t really fully understand what’s happening to their own fellow citizens,” said Brandon Straka, who started his movement for disgusted Democrats after President Donald J. Trump was elected, and he saw how the media and Democratic leaders misrepresented him.“These J6 investigations and FBI raids and overcharging and abuse from the judicial system, which is totally out of hand. I mean, totally, totally out of hand,” Straka said.The former professional hairdresser said he went to the Capitol that day after friends texted him about what was going on and he wanted to see it for himself, but he never actually entered the building.“I walked up the steps, the doors were open and I stood there for eight minutes and I filmed people entering the building, and I uploaded the video that I shot to Twitter, you know, not really thinking much of it,” he said.“Then, about two and a half weeks later, uh, the FBI raided my house, and I was charged with multiple felonies,” he said.“I was taken to jail over what ultimately ended up being a misdemeanor charge,” Straka said.“They took me in, I was made to take all my clothes off in front of a stranger who took my clothes away and brought me back an orange jumpsuit—and when I put it on, I looked down at myself and the first thing I felt was just complete shame,” he said.During his more than one hour behind bars in the cell next to the WalkAway CPAC booth, Straka received a surprise visit from Micki Witthoeft, Ashli Babbitt’s mother who joined him in the cell.The unarmed Babbitt was shot and killed Jan. 6, 2021, in the hallway outside the Speakers Lobby by a Capitol Hill police officer.Witthoeft said she admires Straka and she is grateful for his advocacy for all the J6 families.“It’s been a life-altering experience, not just for me, but for so many people for Brandon, for his mom, for his dad, for, for everyone around him. You know, and, and that’s true of every Jan. 6 family it’s touched him in, in such an awful way,” she said.Straka accepted a plea deal for one misdemeanor count, and a punishment that included a $5,000 fine, and three years probation, but he said he knows many of the J6 defendants got worse than him.“Jan. 6, at this point, has almost come to represent the left’s narrative as a large hammer to pound conservatives down with,” he said.“I think that through the process of that politicization, the prisoners have been, have been forgotten.”",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Zuckerberg: Facebook Suppressed Hunter Biden Laptop Story Ahead Of 2020 ElectionTOPICS:barsCapitolJ6jailnewsOANOANNpoliticsTrumpWASHINGTON TWEETPIN,https://www.oann.com/walkaway-founder-brandon-straka-recreates-jailing-to-raise-awareness-of-j6-prisoners/

We thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically, there’s about to be some kind of dump that’s similar to that,” said Zuckerberg. “So, just be vigilant.”As a result, when the New York Post released its story on Hunter Biden’s laptop, Facebook intentionally suppressed distribution of the story.“Distribution on Facebook was decreased, but people were still allowed to share it,” Zuckerberg said. “So, you can still share it. You can still consume it.”Zuckerberg explained the end result was “fewer people” seeing the article “than would have otherwise.” He says the FBI’s approach to Facebook spurred the company to action.“We just kind of thought, Hey look, if the FBI, which, you know, I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, it’s a very professional law enforcement,” Zuckerberg told Rogan. “They come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something. Then I want to take that seriously.”However, Zuckerberg admitted the FBI did not specifically tell Facebook the Hunter Biden laptop story was the “Russian propaganda” it was referring to, but he said the story “basically fit the pattern.”Zuckerberg went to say he regretted Facebook’s involvement when the story was proven to be factually accurate.“When something like [the Hunter Biden laptop story] turns out to be real, is there regret for not having it evenly distributed,” Rogan asked.“It sucks,” Zuckerberg responded.Zuckerberg compared the situation to that of an innocent man going through a trial.“I think it probably sucks though in the same way that probably having to go through like a criminal trial, but being proven innocent in the end, sucks,” Zuckerberg explained. “Like it still sucks that you had to go through a criminal trial, but at the end, you’re free. So I don’t know what the answer would have been. Don’t do anything, or don’t have any process? I think the process was pretty reasonable. We still let people share it.

Kathy Hochul speaks at True Bethel Baptist Church on Sunday, May 15, 2022, in Buffalo, N.Y. (AP Photo/Joshua Bessex)By Caitlin Sinclair10:30 AM PT – Friday, August 26, 2022Gov. Kathy Hochul spent the last night before Election Day using a new campaign tactic– encouraging GOP voters to leave the state of New York.“Jump on a bus and head down to Florida where you belong,” Gov. Hochul lambasted her opponent, Lee Zeldin, and other Republicans on Monday night — implying anyone who is not a supporter, therefore, “is not a New Yorker.” This reminds us of the time Joe Biden told black voters they “ain’t black” if they were considering voting for former President Donald Trump.“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump then you ain’t black,” Mr. Biden said in 2020.Hochul for the second time in recent weeks used her platform to play into national party politics by attacking the state of Florida. Yet, it is Hochul’s own decisions and policies that actually have New Yorkers envious of the sunshine state.The biggest disconnect: Crime. Voters throughout the state in recent public polling have ranked crime and public safety concerns as top issues. Congressman Lee Zeldin made those issues centerpieces of his campaign. Hochul, meanwhile, has not offered insights into new future priorities or an agenda for what a full next term as governor would include, instead indicating that she would continue to implement and deepen policies and programs already underway. The same programs Big Apple residents find disastrous.….These recent comments were the second time in less than two weeks she has taken a swing at Florida. At a Holocaust-education bill-signing earlier this month, she thanked the state’s 1.77 million Jews for “calling New York home. Don’t go anywhere or to another state. Florida is overrated. I shouldn’t say this, but look at the governor. It starts at the top down,” she said.The state Republican Party sent a fundraising email on Tuesday that featured Hochul’s recent comments. “This year we must send Kathy Hochul and the Democrats a giant message that we aren’t going anywhere. Not only are we NOT leaving, we’re going to take our state back from the corrupt, disastrous Democrats who are destroying New York,” the email said.Afterall, according to Kathy Hochul’s standards, wanting a safe city with a thriving economy doesn’t qualify you as a “real New Yorker.” That is alright Kath…. us GOP’ers  will leave and take our tax money. You can have the illegals, the crime, and the poor quality of life.TOPICS:Donald TrumpFloridaGOPkathy hochulLee ZeldinNew York TWEETPIN","New York Gov.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:18 PM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022The judge presiding over the Mar-a-Lago raid rules the affidavit can not stay totally private. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart announced Thursday that the Department if Justice did not meet the burden of showing the entire document should stay sealed. Reinhart ordered the “redacted” version of the affidavit to be made public by noon Friday.Former President Donald Trump has called for the affidavit’s full release with his spokesperson saying, “Democrat officials use redactions to hide their own corruption just like they did with the debunked Russia hoax.”Trump has continued to suggest Joe Biden did know about the raid of Mar- a-Lago. While taking to Truth Social Thursday, Trump questioned if people really believed the President was unaware of “the greatest political attack in the history of the US.” His remarks came after Biden told reporters Wednesday that he had no advance notice about the raid.The Radical Left Democrat prosecutors are illegally trying to circumvent, for purely political gain, the Presidential Record’s Act, under which I have done absolutely nothing wrong. It can not be circumvented, for me or any other President. They illegally Raided my home, and took things that should not have been taken. They even broke into my safe, an unthinkable act!— Donald Trump via Truth SocialIn a separate post, Trump said Democrat prosecutors are illegally trying to circumvent the Presidential Record’s Act for purely political gain. He contended he has done absolutely nothing wrong and authorities took things from his home that should not have been taken.Meanwhile, Biden has continued to insist he did not know about the FBI raid of Trump’s home until after it happened. While speaking to reporters Wednesday, Biden said he had no advance notice about the raid, echoing prior remarks by White House officials.However, Republicans believe the unprecedented raid must have been approved at the highest level and Biden must have at least known about it. They argue if it wasn’t then it means the Department of Justice has gone rogue. Meanwhile, members of the GOP say if the raid was approved by Biden then it is, indeed, a politically-motivated attack.","WASHINGTON, DC – NOVEMBER 13: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about Operation Warp Speed in the Rose Garden at the White House on November 13, 2020 in Washington, DC.

On Tuesday night, the US central command (CENTCOM) confirmed a series of successful precision air-strikes in Syria targeting terrorists with ties to the Iranian Guards Corps.Statement Regarding Precision Strikes in Syriahttps://t.co/ED69Xq0tm3 pic.twitter.com/hpWw1NNMNV— U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) August 24, 2022Reports said guided bomb units were dropped from four F-15s and F-16s. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby commended the move. He stressed that the strikes were necessary to prevent future attacks on American troops.“As you heard from CENTCOM, these strikes were a direct response to attacks and ongoing threats against U.S. forces by Iran-backed groups, just like the ones we saw on August 15th,” said Kirby. “As before, we don’t seek escalation, but we remain prepared to respond to any ongoing threat. We took this action because the President determined it was in our national interest to do so.”Kirby also touched on the developing talks between European, Iranian and American diplomats regarding the resurrection of the 2015 nuclear deal. Israeli officials, including its current Prime Minister and last two Prime Minsters, have all come out against America agreeing to the deal. They all warned of the devastating impact the deal would have on Israel. I just spoke with my friend, President @EmmanuelMacron.We discussed the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.Iran cannot be allowed to endlessly buy time and receive more concessions while it advances its nuclear program and spreads terror worldwide. pic.twitter.com/HN6cOEx6d6— יאיר לפיד – Yair Lapid (@yairlapid) August 22, 2022נלחם בתקשורת האמריקנית נגד הסכם הגרעין המסוכן עם איראן >> pic.twitter.com/t7u2RoqkeU— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) August 24, 2022I call on @POTUS Biden & the US administration to refrain, even now at this last minute, from signing the agreement with Iran.

That’s why we’re so focused on a diplomatic outcome to that, to see that result in a return to the JCPOA. But I think it’s important to be clear whether or not we reach a return to the JCPOA, the president’s commitment to protect U.S. personnel and confront Iran’s malign behaviors in the region that jeopardize our people or our friends will stay unwavering.”Meanwhile, on the Ukraine front, the Biden administration is looking to fork over another three-billion-dollars worth of military aid to the country to celebrate the sixth month mark of the crisis with Russia. Reports say that the military industrial complex has already contributed $10-point-six-billion worth of equipment to Ukraine. Kirby embattled former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and many members of the United Nations Security council who decried Russia’s efforts in Ukraine. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all.

That is why the UK will continue to stand with our Ukrainian friends.I believe Ukraine can and will win this war. pic.twitter.com/FIovnqJGTS— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) August 24, 2022They all seemed to be in agreement that Russia needs to be punished while Ukraine needs to be held up. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, shared her support for country.“Let’s be clear. The international community will never recognize Russia’s attempt to change Ukraine’s borders by force,” Thomas-Greenfield said. Meanwhile, recent analyses of Joe Biden’s handling of foreign policy, has concluded that his method has been destructive to the international community and to America’s image on the world stage.  Former Trump administration Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, David Schenker, combated the Biden administration’s assertion that the Middle East is the most stable it’s been in years. Schenker pointed out that Iraq has fallen prey to the influence of Iranian terrorists and bolstering the Ayatollah’s geo-political position in the region. Additionally, other experts ingrained in the fabric of America’s foreign policy, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, have lamented that America’s foreign policy now has no compass, predicting a greater war with Russia and China could come about if the Biden administration keeps course.","President Joe Biden waves after returning to the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022.

1:24 PM PT",Richard Baris: It’s Clear GOP Voters Not Ready to Move On From Trump,"Richard Baris: It’s Clear GOP Voters Not Ready to Move On From TrumpDaniel Baldwin, OAN White House CorrespondentUPDATED 1:24 PM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022Democrat Pat Ryan claimed victory in a special election in a bellwether district in New York’s Hudson Valley Tuesday evening. While many election pundits are citing this win as a signal of a dying red wave, Richard Baris, the director of Big Data Poll, says there is no other way to spin it.“I think it’s significant that the Democrats won that seat,” Baris said. Pat Ryan beat Mullinaro. There’s no way to spin that otherwise.” Baris did note turnout in this special election was down by about 200,000 votes from the historical norm. Baris says New York’s 19th Congressional District usually draws about 350,000 votes. For example, in the 2020 general election, this same district drew a total of 352,771 votes. But Tuesday evening, only 128,991 people turned in their ballot to vote. Baris says this is a sign the GOP is struggling to move the needle without former President Donald Trump on the ballot. “What this tells me in New York 19 is that without Donald Trump involved in some of these fights,” Baris explained. “Whether he is trying to beat a more establishment candidate in a nomination, or his candidate is just favored and he’s, he’s there driving excitement up, Republicans are having a hard time on their own getting people excited.”President Joe Biden carried New York 19 by less than 2 percentage points in 2020. Ryan claimed 51.1% (65,943) of the vote with Molinaro only securing 48.8% (62,952). Ryan is an Ulster County executive and will only serve four months in the current district. Baris says Molinaro should have won this seat.“[He] did about as well in Dutchess County, which is his own backyard, Biden won that area,” Baris explained. “He did about as well as any Republican could have. We have to remember that the district still did swing about 11 points in favor of Republicans. And the fact is Democrats can’t afford that in many of these districts across the country.”Baris says the big takeaway from the race is that the GOP is struggling to turn out the vote without the 45th president.“The big picture for me is that without Donald Trump on that ballot, they have a hard time bringing out lower propensity working class people who are not sold on the Republican party,” said Baris. “This idea of moving on from Donald Trump, [the voters] not ready to do that yet. It’s clear.”TOPICS:Big Data PollDonald TrumpDutchess CountyelectionNew YorknewsOANOANNPat RyanpoliticsREPUBLICANSRichard BarisVOTING TWEETPIN",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/richard-baris-its-clear-gop-voters-not-ready-to-move-on-from-trump/

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:05 PM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022Members of the Uvalde school board voted to remove Police Chief Pete Arredondo over his response to the Robb Elementary Shooting. The unanimous vote has terminated the contract of the disgraced Police Chief.During a meeting on Wednesday, the school board secretary Laura Perez made the motion to remove Arredondo from his position. Her motion received an overwhelming amount of support from members of the board.Prior to this, Arredondo had already turned in his resignation letter after being heavily criticized for his actions during the shooting incident at Robb Elementary which left 21 people dead including 19 children.“Mister Board President, I move that good cause exist to terminate the non-certified contract of Pete Arredondo effectively immediately,” said Perez. “I further move that good cause exist to ratify the unpaid leave status of Mister Arredondo starting July 19, 2022. Finally I move to authorize the superintendent to issue written notice to Mister Arredondo of this board action including filing any needed reports required by the termination.”Members of the community were left unsatisfied despite the decision to strip the school district Police Chief of his title. Robb Elementary student, Caitlyn Gonzalez, lambasted the police who were present at the school during the incident saying they ‘don’t reserve to wear a badge’.Before Uvalde CISD voted to fire Pete Arredondo, a young Uvalde girl demanded that law enforcement who responded at Robb ""turn in your badge and step down."" https://t.co/OJRzBkMxQY pic.twitter.com/LDiSBaSVWP— KENS 5 (@KENS5) August 25, 2022“I have messages for Pete Arredondo and all the law enforcement that were there that day: turn in your badge, and step down,” said Gonzalez. “You don’t deserve to wear one.”Another Uvalde resident, Daniel Myers, expressed his outrage at the school board. He accused them of not caring about the families who were affected by the tragedy. Myers also believes the board was trying to cover up the incident by dismissing Arredondo.“You guys don’t care a squawk about these families,” claimed Meyers. “If it was one of your children, hands would be rolling right now. But because it’s not, you don’t care. You are not going to sweep this under the rug. You’re not. All of you are accountable.”In the meantime, several government agencies including the FBI have launched investigations into the police response to the shooting.","Texas Department of Safety Troopers stand by for a meeting of the Board of Trustees of Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:50 PM PT – Saturday, August 27, 2022New data from the CDC suggests that monkeypox cases are on the decline in the United States. While speaking at a virtual conference on Friday, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said she was cautiously optimistic about these reports.“We have started to see globally that we may be turning a corner,” Dr. Walensky said. “We in the United States had our first case about two weeks after some of the European countries that we have also started to see turn around and, as you note, or turned downward. As you note, there are certain jurisdictions, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, that are starting to report that they’re starting to see a downward trend. I want to be cautiously optimistic about these, not only because of the downward trend, but because of the AMIS (American Men’s Internet Service) data that Dr. Daskalakis just noted.”However, Walensky raised concerns about the so-called racial disparities in vaccine delivery despite the Biden administration saying they will have shipped at least three-million vaccines by the end of their next phase in addressing the outbreak. She pointed to several factors which included the lack of trust in public health initiatives from the federal government among other reasons.“Now the administration data also show that among the first doses given, the majority of recipients have been adults age 25 to 39, with around 53% of first doses administered in this age group so far,” stated Walensky. “The majority of first dose recipients, 92% have been males, and 6% of doses have been administered to women. Regrettably, we at the CDC are not receiving data by gender and are unable to report it as such.”Despite this, Walensky announced that the organization will begin promoting the equitable distribution of monkeypox vaccines and will work with communities to ensure their deliveries are to those who have a high risk of contracting the virus.“Given the early evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in monkeypox vaccine administration, the CDC remains committed to reducing the impact of health disparities by collaborating with jurisdictions on provision of educational materials and promotion of equitable access to monkeypox vaccines,” the doctor said. “We’re also working with communities to provide vaccine and harm reduction education at large events attended by groups at highest risk for monkeypox right now.”So far, over 17,000 monkeypox cases have been reported in the United States. The virus mainly spreads between men who have sex with other men, but recent reports from health officials suggested that it can spread to everyone.","WILMINGTON, DELAWARE – DECEMBER 08: Dr. Rochelle Walensky, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to head the Centers for Disease Control, speaks during a news conference at the Queen Theater on December 08, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware.

On Friday, Trudeau and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrapped up their multi-day meeting where they discussed Arctic Security at a Royal Canadian Air Force base in Cold Lake, Alberta.Wrapping up an excellent visit to #Canada, which makes key contributions to #NATO & to international security. Thank you for all you do, including strong support to #Ukraine, leading our multinational forces in Latvia, and increasing our awareness of evolving #Arctic challenges. pic.twitter.com/nBowP07FUk— Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg) August 26, 2022“Today is an opportunity to further deepen the connection Canada has to NATO and continue the great work we’re doing, whether it’s in Ukraine or defending Canada’s… sort of NATO’s northern and western flank,” said Trudeau. Both leaders said the renewed efforts to secure Canada’s northern region comes as enemies of the West, namely China and Russia, are looking to expand a military presence in the Arctic. NATO is reportedly growing its members in the Arctic region -with experts saying the acceptance of Finland and Sweden is near. Their acceptance would mean that Russia would be the only country in the region not a part of the Western Alliance.“NATO is an Arctic alliance. Canada plays a very important part in that both with the radar sites, the NORAD the presence in the high north, but also, of course, with the advanced fighter jets, the air defense systems,” said Stoltenberg. “The… many advanced systems you have throughout Canada, which is, of course, important for the whole alliance.”So far, Canada has contributed nearly $3.5 Billion to Ukraine amid its conflict with Russia.Our support for Ukraine remains steadfast – as does our commitment to holding the Russian regime accountable. At the Crimea Platform summit, I announced that we’re imposing more sanctions on Russia and providing more assistance to Ukraine. Get the details: https://t.co/poX2j318wv— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) August 23, 2022Critics of the West’s measures believe that the conflict between those two countries was sparked from NATO forces creeping near Russia’s western border.Meanwhile, reports say Stoltenberg could squeeze Canada for its mandated two-percent GDP contribution for NATO’s defense spending, a target Canada has a history of missing.","OTTAWA, ON – MARCH 07: Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends a news conference on March 7, 2019 in Ottawa, Canada.

In the video, he also added that California remains a pro-abortion state. “I don’t like it. I don’t like DeSantis… the way he talked about Fauci,” Newsom said. “You can disagree with people. They’re bullies. My mom used to wash my mouth out with soap if I talk like that. I don’t like what’s happening. Threatening people if they come to California for Reproductive Rights in States like Texas placing bounties, it’s a serious moment in American history. So why I’m doing those ads? It’s because I can’t take it. I gotta sleep at night.” This statement comes after Newsom threw his support behind DeSantis’s gubernatorial opponent Charlie Crist. He pledged $100,000 to Crist’s Florida campaign. Despite the endorsement from Democrat darling Newsom, polls show Crist trailing DeSantis ahead of the November gubernatorial election.","SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA – SEPTEMBER 14: California Gov.

And they were just waiting for an excuse to bully Taiwan,” the Senator said. “They are clearly testing Taiwan’s resolve and the rest of the world’s tolerance for even more imperialist violence.”The Tennessee Republican is the latest US lawmaker to visit the island. She joined the ranks of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other members of Congress who recently visited Taiwan. In the meantime, Blackburn urged the Biden administration to help America’s ally defend itself from Chinese aggression.
