9:20 AM PT",Sen. Romney: White House COVID funding request was not transparent,"Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has accused the White House of not being transparent with how it spent COVID relief funds. The Utah lawmaker made the accusation during a Senate COVID hearing with administration officials Thursday.While questioning Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Dawn O’Connell, Romney asked why the administration had misled legislators while requesting pandemic aid. The senator claimed the White House had said it was unable to procure additional therapeutics and vaccines, but was suddenly able to do so in June.“We have runaway inflation, yet this administration has recklessly and unilaterally spent taxpayer money and has failed to be transparent with Congress about it,” noted the Republican. “Their careless stewardship and dishonesty tears at the trust relationship our branches of government operate on.”Months ago, the Administration asked Congress for new funding to purchase COVID-19 therapeutics. Later, their plea proved misleading when they diverted existing funds to make the purchase—exposing that additional taxpayer money was unnecessary. This dishonesty is unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/krBtoaKW5I— Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) June 16, 2022Romney alleged the White House knew it was feasible to purchase such means, but chose to disperse funds towards other endeavors.","Sen.

In the video release, Laxalt said crime, illegal immigration and drug trafficking are surging in the state. He also added, it’s no wonder why fewer than half of Nevadans approve of the incumbent senator.﻿In the 30-second spot, he accused Cortez Masto of supporting policies that are wreaking havoc for hard working Nevada families.

According to poll released Wednesday, Lombardo holds a slight lead over the Democrat incumbent.Lombardo, who is the current Sheriff of Clark County and received 45th President Donald Trump’s endorsement in April, won the GOP nomination on Tuesday. In a speech on election night, he said the win was not just about him.“Tonight is just a victory for a campaign,” he voiced. “Tonight is a win for Nevada to cross the state. It’s a win for parents and their children’s education. It’s a win for safer communities and it’s a win for small business owners.”It is an honor to be your Republican nominee for governor.

While speaking outside a courthouse in Washington Thursday, Bannon said primary results show the Democrat Party is losing its grip on power. He also stressed the January 6 Committee is illegitimate.“MAGA is on the march,” he stated. “The adjacent committee is totally irrelevant.”Bannon proclaimed Republicans will take back the House and the Senate in November.“We believe in the ballot box,” he noted. “He believe in fair, free and transparent elections.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:04 PM PT – Thursday, June 16, 2022The Senate Health Committee held a hearing regarding the ongoing federal response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci appeared before the panel virtually Thursday, shortly after he tested positive for the virus himself. This didn’t stop the 81-year-old from sharing a heated exchange with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “Can you tell me if anybody on the vaccine approval committees ever received any money from the people who make the vaccines?” Paul demanded.This came after the FDA green-lit Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for kids under the age of five. Paul asked Fauci if he was aware of any studies that show reduction in hospitalization or death for children who take a booster. Fauci said there “hasn’t been enough data accumulated.”“If I give a patient 10 mRNA vaccines and they make protein each time,” Paul questioned. “Is it true that we should give people 10 boosters?” Prior to his testimony, Fauci argued booster shots have shown to significantly reconstruct and enhance the level of antibodies that neutralize Omicron and other variants. Despite this claim, he received two booster shots before testing positive for the virus.Congress provided $1.9 trillion for COVID-19 response last year.Yet the Biden Admin can’t provide clear answers on where it went – even as they ask for billions more.@SenatorBurr: ""Where's that money gone?

According to Breitbart News on Thursday, the tech giant curated a list of phrases to replace terms such as “motherhood,” “manhole” and “cowboy.” These replacements will be suggested to Google Drive users through their auto correct feature.“This was an amazingly ham-handed feature,” said an anonyms Google employee. “A crude manually curated, but poorly vetted list of anything vaguely race or gender-related that led to an obviously bad user experience. It’s hard to believe it ever went through user research.”However, the company struggled to find alternatives for words such as “shaman” and “manhandle.” The new feature was announced earlier in the year, with trial runs being met with universal negative reviews. This described the company’s attempt to be more inclusive as being overzealous.In leaked footage from an internal Google Town Hall meeting in 2016, the company’s top executives talked about using their technology to make advance progressive values. This occurred just days after Donald Trump was elected.Alphabet Chief Financial Officer, Ruth Porat tearfully pledged that the company would “use the great strength and resources”  they have to continue to push forward “really important values” in the Trump-era.

She said she is “looking forward to speaking with the committee.” Ginni made the comment to the Daily Caller on Thursday and told the outlet she can’t wait to clear up misconceptions.Her remarks came as committee chairman Benny Thompson (D-Miss.) told reporters the panel sent a letter to Thomas requesting she testify before them.NEW: Jan. 6 Select Committee Chair Bennie Thompson says they will request testimony from Ginni Thomas in light of the Eastman emails.“We think it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee.”— Andrew Solender (@AndrewSolender) June 16, 2022The conservative activist is reportedly being targeted by the committee over text messages to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and alleged emails to Attorney John Eastman regarding the 2020 election. Thompson said the emails “might come up at some point” in their hearings, though they were still in the “discovery phase.” Eastman claimed he did not discuss matters before the Supreme Court with Ginni Thomas or her husband.“Whether or not those news accounts were true, I can categorically confirm that at no time did I discuss with Mrs. Thomas or Justice Thomas any matters pending or likely to come before the Court,” Eastman voiced. “The emails with Ginni Thomas were related to an invitation to give an update about election litigation to a group she met with periodically.”Thomas’s attempts to overturn the election results have drawn fierce criticism from Democrats. Her involvement in the efforts has raised ethical questions over her husband’s role in deciding cases related to the election and January 6. Justice Thomas has argued his decisions are entirely separate from his wife’s activism.","Chapman School of Law professor John Eastman testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, on March 16, 2017, at a House Justice subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet hearing on restructuring the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:01 AM PT – Thursday, June 16, 2022Moderna plans to study its COVID-19 vaccine in infants as young as 3-months-old. The biotech company announced Wednesday that it will enroll as many as 700 babies in their experiment, dubbed Baby Cove, in September. The babies will reportedly receive two doses of Moderna’s vaccine within an eight-week period.The announcement comes as the FDA declared Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines to be safe and effective for children 6-months to 6-years-old, which means this is one step closer to full FDA authorization. During a Wednesday hearing, an FDA committee unanimously endorsed both vaccines after a testimony from a panel of medical experts and representatives from both companies.“I do believe the benefits far outweigh the risks that were involved and personally, I really do believe this recommendation does fill a significant unmet need for a really ignored younger population in need of options,” said Dr. Michael Nelson, an FDA committee member. “Families will now have a choice that they did not have before, and I fully believe in the intelligence of families to make the right choice for their family and children.”The committee endorsed the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines while citing a recent report from the CDC, purportedly showing an increase in COVID deaths amongst infants and young children.“Unfortunately, infants and young children can and do die with COVID,” said Dr. Evan Anderson of the Emory School of Medicine. “As of June 2, more than 440 infants and young children aged zero through four have died with COVID as documented by CDC. This is a tremendous burden of disease.”The hearing ended with the committee expressing concerns about “vaccine hesitancy” due to reports about adverse side effects such as paralysis tied to COVID-19 vaccines. Other adverse symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, appendicitis and herpes.“I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get the third dose,” expressed Dr. Jeannette Lee, another FDA committee member. “As we know, it’s a struggle to get people in for two. We’ve already seen with the boosters for adults, lots of people don’t take them. And so my concern is that you have to give them three doses to really get what you need. I’m just concerned that that some won’t.”The decision is now in the hands of CDC advisers who will vote on Saturday whether to sign-off on authorizing both vaccines. If authorized, the vaccines could be made available for young children as soon as next week.","FILE – A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is displayed on a counter at a pharmacy in Portland, Ore. on Dec. 27, 2021.

(Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:50 PM PT – Thursday, June 16, 2022Democrats and the mainstream media appear to be downplaying the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Apart from a White House statement condemning Kavanaugh’s assassination attempt in his Maryland home, President Joe Biden has not spoken personally about the matter.This comes despite Biden making several public appearances to promote his agenda since the incident earlier this month. So far, Attorney General Merrick Garland has been the most prominent Biden administration official to personally address the assassination attempt on Kavanaugh.“This kind of behavior is obviously behavior that we will not tolerate,” Garland voiced. “Threats of violence and actual violence against the Justice is a strike at the heart of our Democracy. We will do everything we can to prevent them and to hold people who do them accountable. Last month, I accelerated the protection of all the Justice’s residences 24/7.”Mainstream media outlets also appear to be mostly avoiding the issue. On air, apart from the initial coverage of the incident, the murder attempt has been largely ignored by NBC and CNN among others. On print, it was shoved deep in the pages of the New York Times the day after the incident and not on the cover of a number of publications.The dismissal was noted by many of Kavanaugh’s neighbors, whose community was recently swarmed by protesters angry over the possibility the conservative judge will be among those who could vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.“You don’t get to take away my bodily autonomy and enjoy your Saturday night at home,” a protestor stated. “You can do one or the other.”The Justice’s neighbors contend had the assassination attempt happened to a liberal federal official, the media would treat the threats more seriously.","Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh stands during a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, on April 23, 2021.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:30 AM PT – Friday, June 17 2022Vice President Kamala Harris is set to lead the Biden administration’s latest disinformation task force, which appears to be disguised as programs and policies. On Thursday, White House officials unveiled plans they claim are intended to protect “political figures” and journalists from “misinformation” as well as “abuse.”According to the presidential memorandum. the task force protects the online expression of those seeking government roles from internet critics. Some have seen this as a preemptive defense measure for future Biden nominees as disinformation czar Nina Jankowicz resigned after her internet footprint resurfaced during her nomination process.However, Harris claimed the measure will shield all members of the intersectional community from disproportionate online scrutiny.“The internet is a place of fear. One in three women under the age of 35 report being sexually harassed online,” she noted. “Over half of the LGBTQ+ people in our country are survivors of severe harassment. Nearly one in four Asian Americans report being called an offensive name, usually motivated by racism.”Harris touted the task force as a way for the government to make the internet safe, covering a variety of sectors such as online extremism to protecting a woman’s location as she is receiving an abortion. The Vice President claimed laws must change with the times and promised increased funding to train officials on the new protocol.“The collective work will help modernize the federal government’s response to violence against women and people of all genders,” she stated. “It will lead to more evidence informed policies and interventions. And it will support more federal funding to address online harassment and abuse, including grants to train law enforcement and prosecutors.”This new task force will include Attorney General Merrick Garland and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and will submit its blueprint to combat gender-based violence to multiple agencies within the next six months. Within the next year it will issue recommended measures to be taken by internet platforms, stand and local governments and schools.In April, critics slammed President Biden for what they believed was his attempt to create a “dystopian” disinformation bureau intended for the government to patrol online free speech. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre could not clarify how the new task force will differ from the disinformation governance board.Watch the full briefing here:﻿","Vice President Kamala Harrisspeaks during a meeting about abortion rights and Roe v.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:00 PM PT – Friday, June 17 2022Men’s Mental Health Month puts a spotlight on mental healthcare in a demographic which it’s often ignored. According to Mental Health America, men die by suicide 4x higher than women and are often told to “man up” or bottle their emotions. Culturally, American men are looked at as the breadwinners of their families, which some claim is an immense responsibility.“Too many men feel pressure to stay quiet about mental health,” said Katie Dolieslager with the Arrow Project. “Many of the men I’ve worked with don’t know where to find help or they were coping alone.”Their has been a lot of pressure on men to be unwavering and to provide financially for their families over the years. That type of responsibility can create high levels of stress and anxiety. On top of that, men may have a genetic predisposition to mental health issues, or they may experience trauma from work or military experiences.“It has to do with men just culturally being kind of taught and brought up to hold things in,” stated Chris Mason, Board Member with National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of the Central Shenandoah Valley. This month is men’s mental health month, big shoutout to all men who have been going through a lot alone because they can’t share their problems with anyone since men were taught to “man up” rather than “speak up”. You’re strong. I respect you.— Shola (@jayythedope) June 9, 2022 Experts said proper sleep habits, nutrition, physical activity and stress management are all key contributors to a sound mind. More than six million men are estimated to suffer from depression every year nationwide. As time goes on, there will likely be more space for men to express feelings openly without backlash.“If we get it out where men can say, You know what? It’s OK to speak with someone, we will will be ok,” voiced professor Danny Burgess.  “That seeing someone doesn’t mean you’re crazy or weak, or any of the things. The stigma labels that sometimes. Then maybe we can intervene at an earlier point to not get to that point where they’re considering suicide and attempting with very lethal means.”Officials are now looking to break the stigma around mental health treatment.","FILE – In this March 19, 2020, file photo Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, left, accompanied by Gen.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:22 AM PT – Friday, June 17 2022President Joe Biden is reportedly planning to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid speculation he may lift Trump-era tariffs on China. According to Bloomberg News on Thursday, the Biden administration considered holding a talk with Xi this summer amid attempts to bring down inflation in the US.“I think you could see some tariffs lifted,” said AGF Investments Chief US Policy Strategist Greg Valliere. “Their is a fight within the administration right now. The New York Times had a good piece on this yesterday, between people who feel the tariff should be listed and others who say no.”The sides are expected to discuss steps to prevent escalation in mutual tensions. Previously, Biden’s officials condemned China for refusing to join anti-Russian sanctions and advancing it’s political influence in Southeast Asia.Back in May, Biden landed in South Korea and met with new President Yoon Suk-yeol. He had North Korea at the top of his agenda. He also spoke with Jinping during the visit. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan predicted the two would speak again soon following the conversation.Tune in as I deliver remarks with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. https://t.co/vnkjCXQQfw— President Biden (@POTUS) May 20, 2022“I wouldn’t be surprised if in the coming weeks President Biden and President Xi speak again,” Sullivan voiced.Sullivan previously spoke with Yang Jiechi, a key foreign policy adviser to Xi. He claimed he was “direct with him about our concerns about North Korea’s nuclear and missile activities and our view that this is not in China’s interests.”“It’s not in America’s interests,” he stated. “China should contemplate taking whatever steps it can to reduce the possibility of a provocative North Korean Act. We had a good back and forth on that subject.”The Biden admin still stands ready to meet North Korea without preconditions says @SecBlinken. He does not take that offer off the table when asked if it would stand if North Korea conducts a nuclear test.— Kylie Atwood (@kylieatwood) June 13, 2022In the meantime, a potential phone call between Biden and Xi could take place as soon as July. An in-person meeting would have to wait until after a Chinese Communist Party Summit this fall. Analysts said Biden could make concessions to China to remedy the US economy.","WASHINGTON, DC – FEBRUARY 14: (AFP OUT) U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (R) and Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping shake hands before an expanded bilateral meeting with other U.S. and Chinese officials in the Roosevelt Room at the White House February 14, 2012 in Washington, DC.
