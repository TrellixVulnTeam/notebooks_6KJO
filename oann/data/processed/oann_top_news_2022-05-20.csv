(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:16 PM PT – Tuesday, May 17, 2022GOP lawmakers lament President Joe Biden is letting the economy spiral out of control at the expense of small business owners.On Monday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a round table conference with representatives and business owners to discuss what’s going wrong with Biden’s approach to the economy.He stressed the President’s massive spending proposals and mismanagement of the federal government has led to the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. McCarthy added, as a former small business owner, he couldn’t imagine trying to operate during and after a pandemic.“You just came out of a pandemic hoping it would be better,” the congressman stated. “And then you’ve got high regulations, higher gas prices, and in a small business you really learn the economic responsibility but you can’t just keep spending money. That’s what the government has been doing, propelling inflation along the way.”Congresswoman Maria Salazar (R-Fla.) went on to say inflation is “killing the American dream.” She noted one-in-five small businesses in the country are created by minorities and around 70 percent of Miami businesses are minority owned. She claims the rising cost of raw materials and restrictive laws are making running those businesses more difficult.“All this is doing is killing the American dream,” said Salazar. “Because the American dream for an immigrant is to create your small business.”Additionally, the business owners detailed the cost of soaring gas and food prices, which have caused them to raise the price of their goods..@RepFeenstra: “There’s a lot of fear right now in the breadbasket to the world” because of President Biden’s failed policies. pic.twitter.com/8Rp3H0KGvF— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) May 16, 2022Though these changes are driving customers away, they believe Americans are waking up to extreme leftist policies and will come out to vote for Republicans in the midterms.","FILE – House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., speaks to reporters at his weekly news conference, at the Capitol in Washington, March 18, 2022.

McConnell said Sunday that Finland and Sweden would be “important additions” to NATO as he led a delegation of GOP senators to the region in a show of support against Russia’s aggression. (Anders Wiklund/TT News Agency via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:14 AM PT – Tuesday, May 17, 2022The Senate has advanced the $40 billion aid package for Ukraine. In an 81-to-11 vote Monday, the upper chamber overwhelmingly moved to put the measure to a final vote. The 11 senators who voted ‘no,’ including Tennessee Republican Bill Hagerty, expressed concerns of putting the war in Ukraine above American interests.The measure easily passed in the House, but was single handedly stalled in the upper chamber by Kentucky Sen, Rand Paul last week. The Republican said lawmakers must install a special inspector general to oversee how the Ukraine military aid is spent. Paul explained that his oath of office “is to the national security of the United States of America.”“The US is trying to recover from the $1.6 trillion we spent on wars in the Middle East,” he stated. “Not to mention the $5 trillion borrowed for COVID. We should not forget that the Soviet Union collapsed in large part, not because it was defeated militarily, but because it ran out of money.”The lower chamber had passed the legislation in a 368-to-57 vote last week, just hours after the bill’s official text was released. All 57 opponents of the spending spree were Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) praised the bill’s passing as a monumental for a crisis that has raged for the past three months.“We should all be very proud that we had the opportunity when (Vladimir) Putin decided whatever it is he decided, to be brutal and cruel and a coward, that we were there to help,” stated the top Democrat. “It’s about democracy versus a dictatorship.”The aid is supposedly split evenly between military and humanitarian efforts with billions of dollars going towards training Ukrainian troops, replenishing weapons stores, propping up the Ukrainian economy and aiding refugees in the US.The bill is $7 billion more than President Joe Biden’s initial request and will put the American aid to Ukraine up to $54 billion since the war first began. With its passing, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) claimed the latest push will bring the crisis closer to a conclusion.“This bill ensures that we are one step closer to making them pay the full price for their actions,” she stated. “And in the process, we will be standing firmly with the Ukrainian people while combating the exploitation of Ukraine’s vulnerable financial system.”Biden and the Democrat Party initially wanted to tie the package in with additional funding to combat COVID. However, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-K.Y.) had pledged to stand in the way of the bill’s passage unless COVID relief funds were dropped.I got to meet with Ukrainian Ambassador Markarova to discuss Ukraine's brave fight.

You possess a selflessness that’s really hard to explain. A rare commitment to your neighbors and your fellow Americans, an unusual bravery that inspires everyone and you’ve been singled out because of your extraordinary heroism.”Today, I awarded the Medal of Valor to 15 public safety officers – including two who died in the line of duty.

On Wednesday, it was revealed that Baretto’s legal team has allegedly obtained surveillance footage from a WaWa gas station in Central Florida where the incident took place. The incident shows their client being tackled from behind by one deputy while another hits him with a taser.That taser shot ignited the fire ball that engulfed Barreto and two nearby deputy’s according to the State Fire Marshall. The family and attorney’s of the man say he never committed a crime.At the time of the incident Osceola Sheriff’s Department alleged that Barretto was part of motorcyclists that were harassing and pointing guns at other drivers. His lawyers claim the video shows the 26-year old was not trying to flee and question why an electrical charge would be deployed at someone dealing with a highly flammable liquid.“In Osceola County we have no tolerance for this type of behavior,” said Osceola Sheriff Marcos Lopez. “We will identify you and catch you, even if you flee into another county.”The Attorney’s have asked for a renewed investigation as the sheriff’s office has not released any additional information including body camera video. On Tuesday, he underwent his sixth surgery since the fire. Doctors say he still has a long road to recovery. His lawyers state that he has been fighting for his life for the past 80 days with third-degree burns over 75-percent of his body.“We’re calling today for FDLE to take this case over or to have the U.S. Justice Department take this case over,” declared the NeJame Law Group. “There’s too much going on, too many questions that need to be asked.”Jean Baretto still has not been arrested or charged with any crime.","Motorcycle enthusiasts attend the 81st annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally on August 8, 2021 in Sturgis, South Dakota.

(Joel Martinez/The Monitor via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:50 AM PT – Thursday, May 19, 2022Border Patrol agents in Arizona are preparing for the expiration of Title 42. Agents say they are experiencing a surge in migrant encounters near their checkpoint in Tucson. On Wednesday, they voiced that their encounters are vastly different from those reported in other border states such as Texas and California.Additionally, they’ve seen a 25-percent increase in 911 calls about illegal border crossings with authorities receiving up to 16 calls per day. Title 42 was put in place during the Trump administration and allowed border agents to turn away migrants attempting to cross into the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“Our numbers of apprehensions or encounters is more than 130,000 fiscal year to date,” said Border Agent Jesus Vasabilaso. “So our fiscal year started in October and then all the way to today. That’s up more than 50-percent compared to last year.”To combat this surge officials set up a working partnership with the Mexican National Guard to apprehend illegal migrants attempting to cross from both sides of the border.“We do what we call mirror patrol,” stated  Vasabilaso. We’ll patrol on our side, they’ll patrol on their side, so we’re both looking for any bad actors around the border. They’re looking for any ladders that smugglers will utilize to get people up and over the fence, they’re looking for people that are up to no good trying to assault migrants. If Title-42 goes away the border is not going to be open.”Title 42 is set to expire on May 23, but a federal judge in Louisiana is expected to hand down a ruling which could keep Title 42 in place.","Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas listens to Raul Ortiz, Chief, U.S. Border Patrol, as he tours the section of the border wall with Mexico, Tuesday, May 17, 2022, in La Joya, Texas.

(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3: 20 PM PT – Wednesday, May 18, 2022Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell (R-D.C.) doubled down on the policy of raising interest rates in coming months which may hurt millions of Americans. In an interview Tuesday, the fed chair admitted higher borrowing costs may cause some “pain” to households and businesses.However, he said it is necessary to curb runaway inflation and their is no way around it. Powell added that he originally hoped the federal reserve could stifle inflation without affecting the labor market but warns unemployment may rise slightly.“I would love to see a labor market that is more in balance, ideally that would start with the number of vacancies coming down,” said Powell. “Vacancies and quits are at an all time high, that suggests the labor market that’s out of balance. Their are more demands than their are workers. I’d love to see people come back into the labor force, We are seeing some of that now, we’d like to see that continue and we’d love to see the job vacancies come back so that your seeing supply and demand get back together”He went on to urge Americans not to worry about the labor market claiming the unemployment rate is now near a 50-year low. He further touted the structure of the U.S. economy saying he believes America will come out of the post-pandemic era strong despite the issues driving inflation. He vows to keep fighting inflation until it slows back down to two percent.“If that involves moving passed their wont be any hesitation about that,” he stated.Many economists criticized the fed chair for waiting too long before raising rates this year, but he believes his policies were “appropriate”. Some economists says riding fed rates may cause a recession in coming months.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Chairman predicts several shifts in the U.S economy that could slow down the rate of globalization.","Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill in Washington.

McConnell blames bad economy on Democrat policiesSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 17, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:15 AM PT – Wednesday, May 18, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) berated his Democrat colleagues for reckless spending while forcing the American people to foot the bill. While addressing the Senate floor Tuesday, the Kentuckian evoked the memory of economic prosperity under Republican leadership.“In early 2020, before the pandemic, Republicans helped create one of the best economic moments for working Americans literally in out lifetimes,” McConnell stated. “Unemployment was low, inflation was low and real take-home pat was rising steadily. In fact, we had wages rising faster for the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale than for the top 25 percent.”The Minority leader noted, the COVID pandemic caused an artificial speed bump for the American economy. He claimed the incoming Democrat government had been set up for success in January of last year as much of the private sector was reopening and COVID vaccines were readily available. However, the long serving senator lamented the political left snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and squandered the good position they had inherited.“But through their far-left policy choices, Washington Democrats have driven our economy right into the ground,” he asserted. “Inflation is setting 40-year records in consecutive months, gas and diesel prices have set new all-time highs on consecutive days, and sticker shock continues to cause headaches for Americans buying household essentials.”Gas prices are now the highest they have ever been in American history. Americans are now paying roughly $4.40 per gallon. That’s up about two whole dollars from when President Biden put his hand on the Bible.— Leader McConnell (@LeaderMcConnell) May 11, 2022McConnell recounted tales from around the country of people scrounging to support themselves amid steep price hikes. From taking out loans to afford food to visiting multiple stores for the lowest prices, the Republican highlighted the various ways Americans have grappled with the 10 percent rise in grocery costs in the past year. However, he accused Democrats of treating government spending as the only solution, which he said is exacerbating the problem.“Fewer than one-in-four American consumers say that this current economic conditions are even ‘somewhat good’ and fewer than one-in-five say the Biden administration’s policies haven’t done anything to help,” McConnell continued. “Democrats made runaway reckless spending their new normal here in Washington. So historic, painful inflation has become the new normal for working families everywhere else.”Despite chastising Democrats for excessive spending, the Minority Leader has been instrumental in drumming up Republican support to advance the $40 billion Ukraine bill in the Senate.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 17, 2022.
