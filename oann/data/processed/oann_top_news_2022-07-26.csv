(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:45 AM PT ‚Äì Monday, July 25, 2022Lawmakers are warning that submitting samples of DNA to private companies may hand over valuable information to America‚Äôs adversaries. Sites like 23andMe could pose immense national security risks.At a recent Aspen Security Summit, Army veteran and Democrat Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) warned America‚Äôs enemies, including Russia and China, are developing biochemical weapons that could target specific people. Crow added, researchers are using DNA data provided to private companies to tailor the weapons to that genetic information. However, he lamented adversaries can get this information easily and without much of a fight.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have a discussion about this without talking about privacy and the protection of commercial data because expectations of privacy have degraded the last 20 years,‚Äù Crow explained. ‚ÄúYoung folks actually have very little expectation of privacy, that‚Äôs what the poll and the data shows. And people will very rapidly spit into a cup and send it in to 23andMe and get really interesting data about their background and guess what? Their DNA is now owned by a private company that can be sold off with very little intellectual property protections or privacy protections.‚ÄùAdditionally, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said the threat of a biochemical attack won‚Äôt just hit humans specifically, but also the food supply. She stressed, America‚Äôs adversaries could weaponize diseases that have already plagued the agriculture sector to kill off animals and plants used for food.‚ÄúSo not necessarily those specific human targets with a particular type of weaponized biological weapon, but also if we look at food security and what can our adversaries do with biological weapons that are directed at our animal agriculture, at our agricultural sector,‚Äù Ernst explained.Meanwhile, Army Gen. Richard Clarke claimed bad actors have been quick to use other chemical weapons with relative ease. He cited alleged uses of chlorine and mustard gas being used in Iraq and Syria by ISIS. Gen. Clarke warned even these weapons do not need complex training in order to use them.ÔªøIn the meantime, the congressmen urged their colleagues to adopt legislation, which could bolster protections for Americans‚Äô personal information. This included healthcare, DNA and consumer patterns. Additionally, they stressed the need to add food security in the realm of national security in order to put more attention on America‚Äôs food supply chain.","Senator Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, looks over papers during a Senate Armed Services hearing to examine the nominations at the Capitol Hill, on Thursday, July 21, 2022, in Washington.

A bipartisan group of senators, including Collins, released proposed changes July 20, to the Electoral Count Act, the post-Civil War-era law for certifying presidential elections that came under intense scrutiny after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and Donald Trump‚Äôs effort to overturn the 2020 election. (Ting Shen/Pool Photo via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:24 AM PT ‚Äì Monday, July 25, 2022Forty-seven House Republicans joined every Democrat in backing codification of same-sex marriage, in turn, sending the bill to the Senate. Now in the upper chamber, the bill, which would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, codify interracial marriage and give legislative backing to the Supreme Court‚Äôs Obergefell decision, could face an uphill battle to the 60 votes needed for passage.All 50 Democrats have announced their support for gay marriage with the onus falling squarely on 10 Republican senators to join them and send the bill to President Joe Biden‚Äôs desk. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has led Republican efforts to codify gay marriage while working closely with the Senates first openly lesbian member, Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, to try and secure the 10 GOP votes. Alaska‚Äôs Lisa Murkowski, Ohio‚Äôs Rob Portman and North Carolina‚Äôs Thom Tillis have also announced their support.If you are a Senator who supports marriage equality then you will support our bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act to protect this freedom and right for same-sex and interracial marriages. Let's stand together and protect the progress we have made.‚Äî Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) July 20, 2022However, even staunch conservatives are getting on board with the bill as Wisconsin‚Äôs Ron Johnson has announced his intention to vote ‚Äòyes.‚Äô He said that while he thinks the bill is unnecessary because overturning gay marriage would disrupt people‚Äôs lives in a way overturning abortion did not, he wouldn‚Äôt oppose its passage.‚ÄúUnlike Roe v. Wade, this pretty well is settled law from the standpoint that people have relied on that and if you overturn it, that‚Äôs a big part of Stare Decisis, it would disrupt a lot of people‚Äôs lives,‚Äù Johnson stated. ‚ÄúRoe v. Wade was about affecting people in the future‚Ä¶as I look at that piece of legislation from the House right now, I don‚Äôt see any reason why I should oppose it.‚ÄùDespite this, opposition still runs steep among some parts of the Senate Republican caucus. South Carolina‚Äôs Lindsey Graham has said that he would continue to support the Defense of Marriage Act passed in 1996 with majority support among both parties in both chambers and signed by Democrat President Bill Clinton.The Republican Whip in the Senate, Texas‚Äô John Cornyn, who‚Äôs fresh off writing the latest anti-Second Amendment legislation with Democrats, has said he feels the issue is an unnecessary distraction because it‚Äôs already settled law.‚ÄúI I think it‚Äôs a contrived issue because the Supreme Court‚Äôs decided the issue, so I don‚Äôt see any reason for the Congress to act,‚Äù he stated.Ted Cruz, Texas‚Äô other Republican senator, along with a few others are also expected to vote ‚Äòno.‚Äô The rest of the caucus remains cagey about giving a direct answer on where they sit. Iowa‚Äôs Joni Ernst has said she needs time to review the legislation and Utah‚Äôs Mitt Romney believes the bill is unnecessary, but is looking into it.Louisiana‚Äôs Bill Cassidy didn‚Äôt say if he would support the bill, but did tell reporters he was amazed they fall for distractions by the Democrats listed off a litany of pressing issues facing the country from a wide open border to record inflation. He said the whole thing was to shift the media‚Äôs attention from those issues.With most Republicans not giving a firm answer one way or the other, it could be a bill with an unknown status until it comes to the floor for a full vote by the body. If it passes, Biden has said he will sign it the moment it gets to his desk. However, even if the bill fails, same sex marriage will still be the law of the land for the foreseeable future with Republican legislators and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh asserting the Obergefell decision isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon.","FILE ‚Äì Sen.

(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:10 PM PT ‚Äì Monday, July 25, 2022Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo confirmed that the Biden administration is considering lifting tariffs on China. In an interview Sunday, Raimondo said officials are looking at potential labor implications of lifting Trump-era tariffs on China. She added that tariffs could be lifted if it helps bring down inflation and alleviate supply chain problems.The Secretary¬†also praised Biden‚Äôs so-called green agenda despite concerns it may further cripple US manufacturing. Despite¬†an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics¬†that lifting tariffs on some Chinese-made products would save households hundreds of dollars, Biden is concerned about the support of unions in making this decision.‚ÄúThere are potential labor implications,‚Äù Raimondo stated. ‚ÄúOne thing about this president is he will never do anything that he thinks will hurt workers in America or union workers in America.‚Äù¬†Labor unions are actively campaigning against dropping tariffs on China with multiple groups filing an official comment to the Office of the US Trade Representative earlier this month to advocate for the tariffs to stay in place. Trump imposed numerous tariffs on China during his time in office. The former president believed that trading practices with the country were unfair to the US. The Biden administration has kept many of the tariffs in place despite indicating some of the policies need to be changed.‚ÄúThe labor market is now extremely strong,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is not an economy that‚Äôs in recession, but we‚Äôre in a period of transition in which growth is slowing. And that‚Äôs necessary and appropriate, and we need to be growing at a steady and sustainable pace.‚ÄùThe Commerce Secretary herself advocated for dropping some of the tariffs, but there is no clear timeline on when the president will make a decision on the issue. Biden‚Äôs thinking could also be impacted by the midterm elections where union support is a big help to Democrats in a year where Republicans are expected to pick up multiple seats.The President is still weighing whether or not to lift tariffs off of China. The action potentially could have an impact on US inflation. @POTUS has said he plans to talk to China's Xi within days. https://t.co/mQq2r8jBU4‚Äî Margaret Brennan (@margbrennan) July 24, 2022Raimondo voiced that the Biden administration may restrict the exports of US technology to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.","Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington, D.C.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis-Pool/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:50 PM PT ‚Äì Monday, July 25, 2022Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) lamented the January 6 show trial is not fair or competitive. In an interview on Monday, Cotton said the Democrat-run panel has ‚Äúno adversarial process‚Äù and it‚Äôs essentially denying due process to its targets.He stressed that there‚Äôs no one on the January 6 committee whose view of the Capitol protest would be different than Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs (D-Calif.). Cotton voiced that the two Republicans on that committee are no different than Democrats in their assessments of those events.‚ÄúThere is no one on that committee who takes a view different from Nancy Pelosi or even a view that‚Äôs like we should examine the full context of all of these statements, of all of these recordings, of all of this video,‚Äù Cotton said. ‚ÄúWe have no idea of the videos and the audio recordings and the testimony is being presented in its full context.‚ÄùHugh Hewitt, the host of the Hugh Hewitt Show asked him ‚ÄúWhat is the principal defect of this committee?‚Äù‚ÄúThat it has no adversarial process whatsoever,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúLiz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), the two Republicans, clearly share the views of the Democrats on the subject of the committee‚Äôs inquiry. If you had someone like Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) or Jim Banks (R-Ind.) on there, not only would they be privy to all the information, but they would be probing that information and probing witnesses to try to get at truth.
