10:09 AM PT",Sen. Warren: Biden should provide abortion on federal lands,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has called on the Biden administration to provide abortions on federal lands in the states that may outlaw that practice. In an interview Sunday, the Democrat said this administration should send money and volunteers to establish abortion services in pro-life states.Federal lands include Indian reservations, national parks and military areas which are mostly in the western US. Warren also said Democrat-run states could provide abortion services to residents of red states.“Now, we’ve got a lot of things on our agenda right now,” said the Massachusetts lawmaker. “First of all, we need to help the women who are pregnant right now and need help. That means sending resources to states like New Mexico that border other states that are going to try to help out. It means getting involved by volunteering and sending money.”The Supreme Court abolished Roe v. Wade last week, prompting several red states to restrict abortions and sparking far-left protests across the nation.“Six justices have overturned Roe, but the Supreme Court doesn’t get the final say on abortion,” Warren noted. “The American people do. We must restore our democracy, so that a radical minority can no longer drown out the will of the people.”#RoeVWade is dead, and I am furious. With the Supreme Court’s decision today, six extremist justices have overturned nearly fifty years of precedent & revoked the constitutional right to an abortion.

According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) that oversees Central Banks, the only way to prevent an inflationary shock is to sharply increase interest rates.The BIS added, the global economy is entering a period of stagflation where prices grow out of control while economic growth is low or negative. The BIS said national finance ministries and Central Banks have exhausted their capabilities to prevent stagflation.“The space of fiscal and monetary policy has been to large extent depleted,” stated Agustín Carstens, BIS General Manager. “Therefore, we should not depend so much on a fiscal and monetary policy to induce economic growth.We need to pass it along so to say to structural policies and, therefore, other sources of growth.”﻿The Swiss-based bank also said western countries must undertake economic reforms to ensure growth in the non-financial sector.","A man exchanges Nigeria’s currency Naira for US dollars in Lagos, Nigeria, on April 19, 2021.

Eric Greitens, speaks at the Taney County Lincoln Day event at the Chateau on the Lake in Branson, Mo., April 17, 2021. (Nathan Papes/The Springfield News-Leader via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:30 PM PT – Sunday, June 26, 2022Missouri Senate candidate Eric Greitens claimed RINO Republicans are helping the far left destroy America. Greitens doubled down on his calls to take down Republicans who don’t wave the banner of the America First movement. During an interview with Breitbart News Saturday, he said he’s honored to have the enemies he’s made.“It’s clear that the RINO’s have failed America,” Greiten said. “It’s not just the left with their crazy ideas and attacks on the country that have put us in crisis. It’s not just the main stream media, it’s also RINO’s because of their corruption that have created this crisis. RINO’s who stab President Trump in the back. RINO’s who stab the American people in the back. RINO’s who failed on election integrity. RINO’s who failed to pass a border wall. RINO’s who supported Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion bill and RINO’s this past week who sold out America on the Second Amendment. People are sick of RINO’s.”He pointed out George Soros, the satanic temple as well as establishment Republicans Karl Rove and Mitch McConnell (Ky.) have come after him for standing up to the political elite. This comes amid outcry from the mainstream media, Big Tech and establishment Republicans over a campaign ad Greitens released last week, where he pretended to go RINO hunting.The RINOs are at it again… pic.twitter.com/81aXuVBIF8— Eric Greitens (@EricGreitens) June 22, 2022The retired Navy SEAL added, it’s former President Trump’s MAGA movement that is championing conservative values and making things happen. He highlighted Trump’s efforts to appoint hundreds of conservative justices to the federal judiciary, including the three Supreme Court justices who voted to repeal Roe v. Wade.“The great momentous moment that we all experience is because of President Trump,” he voiced. “Yesterday’s Supreme Court decision would not have been possible without President Trump. He nominated conservative judges that respect the constitution. He’s the one who took out Hilary Clinton and he did it with no help from the RINO establishment. When I served as Governor they wouldn’t pass pro-life legislation.”Greitens went on to say that the “Never Trump Republicans” are trying to handicap America First patriots, including former President Trump, from holding public offices. He pointed out that Republicans like Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) are helping the January 6 Committee smear Trump’s final days in office. Greitens also said Sen. McConnell has already launched a pact to target the Grietens campaign because he is scared of losing power in Congress. Meanwhile, he vows to uphold the US Constitution.“The first country I ever went to was in 1993 and I went to China,” he shared. “I was actually arrested there for talking about the United States constitution. I’ve been willing to stand up against communists. As a navy seal I fought for the US constitution and I’m gonna continue to do that in the United States senate. By contrast, these RINO’s are after me in this race because they know I’m not going to give into their globalist ideas and I’m going to stand up and fight for the US constitution.”Greitens will face off against other GOP candidates in the August 2 primaries and already has sights on the November 8 general elections. He said America First candidates need to get through to Congress and stand up to the far left. He lamented that establishment Republicans cave to any pressure from progressives while highlighting they folded on gun control, infrastructure and massive spending bills.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22171636327086.jpg, Federal Court Blocks FDA Ban On Juul ProductsTOPICS:Eric GreitensMAGANavy SealnewsOANOANNpoliticsPresident TrumpREPUBLICANSRINOsenate SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/greitens-american-people-are-sick-of-rinos/

The DC Circuit Appeals Court granted Juul’s request to stay in what the company called an “extraordinary and unlawful action.”The move came less than a day after the FDA said findings raised “significant questions” about potential risks from consumers using their products. The e-cigarette company said the decision lacks evidence and they are now allowed to continue selling products as the court further deliberates Juul’s case.In 2019, Juul was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating its fruit and dessert flavors after they became popular among middle and high school students. The next year, the FDA limited flavors in small vaping devices to just tobacco and menthol.Chief Regulatory Officer at Juul Labs Joe Murillo said in a statement to Axios that the company would seek a stay and explore other options “under the FDA’s regulations and the law, including appealing the decision and engaging with our regulator.”Juul said that the FDA cannot argue that there was a “critical and urgent public interest” in immediately removing its products from the market when the agency allowed them to be sold during its review.Meanwhile, the court noted their decision should not be interpreted as a ruling on the merits of the motion.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22175613121103.jpg," Ghislaine Maxwell Placed On Suicide Watch, But Isn’t SuicidalTOPICS:bancourtFDAJuullabsnewsOANOANNSmoking SHARETWEETPINSHARE",https://www.oann.com/federal-court-blocks-fda-ban-on-juul-products/

Trump said that they are proving that their are two systems of Justice in the country as the Democrats are running January 6 show trials, while keeping silent on judicial intimidation.“There can be no greater illustration of the two tiered system of justice,” voiced the former president. “We’ve never had anything like what’s going on right now. At the moment the radical Democrats are staging a ridiculous fake trial over January 6. Their party leaders are saying nothing about the violent intimidation of the united states Supreme Court.”Thank you President Trump! pic.twitter.com/RQjB5dFRDv— Mary Miller (@Miller_Congress) June 26, 2022According to Trump, the root of America’s problems goes right back to November 2020 when Democrats used COVID to rig the presidential election and force him out of office.“They refuse to mention the election fraud and all the irregularities,” he voiced. “There has never been anything like what took place in 2020. They used COVID to rig and steal an election.”He said that the best way to oppose Nancy Pelosi’s committee and the “RINO’s” who support it is to vote for Mary Miller to continue on in the 15th Congressional District. In a surprise to many, the president gave his full endorsement to gubernatorial candidate and State Sen. Darren Bailey (R-Ill.). Bailey is running to unseat Democrat JB Pritzker. He believes Bailey is just the man to win where other ‘Republicans’ may not.“No matter how big or powerful these corrupt radicals may be, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them, this nation belongs to you,” he declared. “We will make America great again!”BREAKING NEWS: President Trump's rally has reportedly broken attendance Illinois records for a political event.

Frank Lucas is asking the voters of Oklahoma for another term in Washington D.C. to advocate for taxpayers.The Congressman is the longest serving House member from the state and a ranking minority member of the science, space and technology committee. Lucas has been representing his constituents in public office since 1994.First serving in Oklahoma’s sixth Congressional District, then representing the third Congressional District since 2003. He touted that Oklahomans know they have a strong conservative voice in Congress when he’s in Washington D.C.“I believe in Frank Lucas, he’s a great man,” said a friend of the Congressman.Lucas is perhaps best known for being an advocate for farmers and ranchers. At a House committee hearing on financial services in March, Lucas illustrated how out of touch Democrats truly are with rural America. The Congressman emphasized in the hearing that when you increase the amount of money chasing goods and services, it drives up the price and it impacts farmers.“If you dramatically increase the amount of money chasing the same or fewer goods and services, then you drive up the price of the goods and services,” Lucas stated. “Farmers across the country are experiencing higher cost for chemicals, seeds, fertilizer, equipment, fuel and labor, among other increased input cost. The squeeze and uncertainty felt by farmers and ranchers right now will be felt for years to come. This means higher food prices we see now may be with us for some time.”The fifth generation Oklahoman received the official Trump endorsement in April. The former president affirmed that Lucas promotes American farmers, defends the Second Amendment, supports military Veterans and encourages innovation.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Pres.

(AP Photo/Michael Sohn)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:00 PM PT – Monday, June 27, 2022Secy of State Antony Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin has not accomplished the goals of his invasion. During an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday, Blinken said Putin’s goal was to erase Ukraine sovereignty and independence from the map, yet he’s already failed.“Let’s not confuse the tactical with strategic,” Blinken said. “When it comes to Putin’s strategic objectives, it’s not working.”Russia’s initial attempt at a surprise attack to seize Kyiv and other areas of Ukraine did not go as planned. In recent weeks, it’s forces have seized cities in Ukraine’s east, including Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk. The adjacent city of Lysychansk is now under intense attack.“We have seen sporadically,” he voiced. “Ever since Putin lost the battle for Kyiv and had to shift his focus just to Eastern and Southern Ukraine, they have occasionally launched missiles at a distance basically to terrorize people.”Blinken’s remarks come out of Germany where G-7 leaders announced a ban on new imports of Russian gold. This comes as the ruble has hit it’s highest level in seven years, but Blinken affirmed Russians are bearing the brunt of economic sanctions. According to the latest report by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34,530 Russian servicemen have died since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian forces have also destroyed 1,507 Russian tanks, 3,637 combat armoured vehicles, 759 artillery systems, 241 multiple rocket launcher systems, 99 air defence systems, 216 warplanes and 183 helicopters.“Even if Russia succeeds in capturing more territory, he will inherit cities and towns that his own artillery have turned to rubble and the local population that hates him,” he expressed.The world is horrified by Russia’s missile strike today, which hit a crowded Ukrainian shopping mall — the latest in a string of atrocities.

In an interview Sunday, Abrams said she wants the Senate to abolish the filibuster for abortion and to allow the federal government to take over state election systems.“As someone who is pro-choice and proudly pro-choice, I believe we need leaders right now who are willing to defend who we are and defend the women under our care,” Abrams said. “We have to be deeply concerned about what is happening to our LGBTQ+ community, to people of color, especially black women who face the highest rates of maternal mortality in the nation and that is exacerbated in the state of Georgia. I believe we need to do more and I want the president to do more. I want our Congress to do more, but we have to recognize that the stage we are in right now is left to the states.”In 2019, a law was signed by Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp that would ban abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, generally at the six week point in a pregnancy. The law was held up in the courts as the Supreme Court considered Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which it decided on Friday, as it overturned Roe. Abrams claimed that the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs will help her in her campaign against Kemp. On Sunday, she voiced that she would work to reverse the state’s abortion ban if she defeats him in November.“I would tell anyone,” she expressed. “Whether you are a business or a citizen thinking about being in Georgia, take into very real consideration the danger that Brian Kemp poses to the life and welfare of women in the state.”We talked to a few Georgia women to hear their reactions in the aftermath of Roe being overturned, how they are personally impacted and why reproductive health care matters to them. pic.twitter.com/IErbJJelGd— Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) June 27, 2022The Democrat declared their is nothing sacrosanct about a nine justice Supreme Court.“This is a choice that has to be made by our both legislative and executive branch,” Abrams stated. “I think we have to recognize their is nothing sacrosanct about nine members on the United States Supreme Court, but that is a long term question.”Last week, Brian Kemp immediately asked the Court to allow his extreme and dangerous six-week abortion ban to take effect.Six weeks is before most women know they are pregnant.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, June 27, 2022World Bank President David Malpass said the global economy will significantly slow down due to high inflation, which will cause political problems in a number of countries. In an interview Sunday, Malpass said the US and it’s allies need to increase production of goods and services, while keeping their economies open and not restrict international trade.His remarks followed anti-Russian sanctions earlier this year that caused problems in the global energy, food and capital markets. He claimed the western world is facing an economic crisis.“It’s a sharp slowdown, including even China,” he said. “We’ve seen the world growth fall by half since January in terms of GDP growth, but there’s also shortages, there’s inflation.”Happy to speak with @POTUS @JoeBiden, @JPN_PMO @Kishida230, @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson, @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau & many others.Grateful for @G7 countries' strong support for the @WorldBank Group as we work to help countries address overlapping global crises. [2/2] pic.twitter.com/O6oMBqaa3A— David Malpass (@DavidMalpassWBG) June 27, 2022 Malpass voiced that central banks should change their policies and regulations to encourage more production of everything, which may alleviate the hardship. He believes record inflation and shortages of key commodities like oil, fertilizer and wheat mean “it’s going to be very hard” for some countries to avoid recession.” It’s possible to produce enough to soften that crisis, but at the rate that we’re going right now the fertilizer isn’t being made,” he stated. “A giant source of fertilizer is from natural gas, through the ammonium channel into the most useful fertilizer. It also is used to make the electricity that converts the minerals into fertilize and that’s just not happening. A lot of the world is shutting down for lack of fertilizer and then those shortages of crops will last for multiple years.”The World Bank President admitted that a recession in the US isn’t out of the question, but he doesn’t disagree with estimates that put the risk of a recession in the US as high as 5o percent.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22178406615186.jpg, Abrams: Nothing Sacrosanct About 9 Member SCOTUSTOPICS:Chinafertilizerinflationnatural gasnewsOANOANNRECESSIONWorld Bank SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/world-bank-chief-were-at-a-crisis-countries-fall-in-one-by-one/

In an interview on Monday, Boyd said farmers need operating loans and emergency funding, which Biden has failed to provide.“The president promised me a meeting last year in July and the meeting hasn’t happened,” Boyd voiced.Boyd stressed that high uncertainty in international commodity markets posed a problem, but Biden isn’t doing anything to help.“We need more help from the Biden administration and we need it right now,” he said. “When you go to a grocery store your going to see more empty food shelves and the commodities that we’ve been so welcome to in this country wont be there readily and available like it has for the past 50 years in the United States.

While kicking off the summit in the Bavarian Alps on Sunday, leaders agreed to strengthen sanctions by banning imports of Russian gold. The move came shortly after Russian missiles rained down on Kyiv earlier that morning and is additional effort to weaken Russia’s economy.The United States has imposed unprecedented costs on Putin to deny him the revenue he needs to fund his war against Ukraine.Together, the G7 will announce that we will ban the import of Russian gold, a major export that rakes in tens of billions of dollars for Russia.— President Biden (@POTUS) June 26, 2022President Biden also announced the launch of the partnership for global infrastructure movement to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative project.“And I’m proud to announce the United States will mobilize $200 billion in public and private capital over the next five years for that partnership,” announced the President. “We’re here today because we’re making this commitment together as a G7 in coordination with one another and to maximize the impact of our work. Collectively, we aim to mobilize nearly $600 billion  from the G7 by 2027.”The initiative is a new version of Biden’s “Build Back Better World,” which he revealed at last year’s summit. Additionally, Biden claimed the effort is critical to America’s economic and national security.“I want to be clear, this isn’t aid or charity,” he stated. “It’s an investment that will deliver returns for everyone, including the American people and the people of all our nations. It will boost all of our economies and it’s a chance for us to share our positive vision for the future, and let communities around the world see themselves and see for themselves the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.”Together, the G7 is demonstrating the strong global leadership it will take to maximize the costs to Putin and his enablers and address the impact of his war on the global economy. pic.twitter.com/N30bBeXyKL— President Biden (@POTUS) June 27, 2022Meanwhile, leaders will continue their meetings in Germany until June 28.
