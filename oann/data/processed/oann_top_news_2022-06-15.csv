(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:22 AM PT – Monday, June 13, 2022President Joe Biden has refused to take responsibility for astronomical gas prices, Instead, he appears to be pointing his finger at oil companies. The President accused Big Oil of exploiting supply shortages to boost profits.While addressing dockworkers at the port of Los Angeles on Friday, Biden claimed oil and gas companies are using the war in Ukraine to justify excessive price hikes. His finger pointing comes as the national average price of gas is $4.99 per gallon and is more than $5 a gallon in 19 states, according to AAA.Joe Biden’s America: •40-year high inflation•Record gas prices•Baby formula shortage•Disastrous border crisis•Crime surge Biden’s policies have failed Americans.— GOP (@GOP) June 13, 2022However, the President went into his typical “whisper mode” to deflect responsibility away from his policies that have cancelled oil field leases and restricted drilling .“They have 9000 permits to drill, they’re not drilling. Why aren’t they drilling?” Biden asked. “Because they make more money not producing more oil. The price goes up, number one. And number two, the reason they’re not drilling is they’re buying back their own stock, which should be taxed, quite frankly. Buying back their own stock and making no new investments.”Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton responded to Biden’s comments. He said the company has been in regular contact with the administration and laid out its plans to increase production as well as as expand refining capacity in the US. For starters, Norton said Exxon is significantly expanding its operations in Texas.Last month, the Biden administration cancelled three oil and gas lease sales scheduled in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska, removing millions of acres from possible drilling.","President Joe Biden arrives at Kirtland Air Force Base to meet with state and local officials on the New Mexico wildfires, Saturday, June 11, 2022, in Albuquerque, N.M.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on domestic terrorism, Tuesday, June 7, 2022, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:20 PM PT – Monday, June 13, 2022A bipartisan group of senators announced a framework for gun control following the recent mass shootings in New York and Texas. On Sunday, the senators announced they had reached an agreement for increased mental health and school security funding, as well as expanded checks on buyers under 21.However, one provision could allow states to violate multiple constitutional rights of it’s citizens. Part of the framework includes a provision to give taxpayer funded incentive grants to states, which implement so-called red flag laws.Such laws, already in place in 19 states and Washington D.C., allow neighbors, coworkers, ex-relations and family members to go to a judge and petition to have guns taken from individuals they claim are dangerous. A judge can typically order an immediate seizure of firearms, sending police to the home to remove the guns.“Put simply, red flag laws empower the government to take firearms first and ask questions later. Often much, much later,” stated Senator Ted Cruz.No crime has to have been committed, just the accusation of being “dangerous” to yourself or others. The judge can have the separation order enforced without the citizen being present to defend themselves in court. According to the far-left ACLU, such laws can infringe not only on the Second Amendment, but also violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment if they are not tailored properly.A prime example of an issue that could arise from such measures occurred in Maryland back in 2018. A man had a red flag order placed against him and while no information on the reason for the order has been released, the man was not committing any crime by continuing ownership of the firearm.Despite this, police showed up to his door and he was armed, but placed the weapon on the ground until police informed him why they were there. The man reportedly became irate, picked up the firearm and had an argument with police. The argument turned violent and shots were fired, resulting in the man’s death.According to Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, this suppression of rights has no positive tradeoffs. He said research showed that red flag laws do not stop mass shootings and negligibly reduces suicides.“No research has found any statistical reduction in crime,” said Cruz. “Including, mass shooting fatalities from confiscation laws and studies about suicide reduction show mixed results.”Despite the red flag incentives being proposed, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican leader in the negotiations, has maintained an A-Plus rating from the NRA. The gun rights organization has said they will oppose efforts to strip constitutional rights from Americans, but only once a bill is drafted outside of a framework.Along with Cornyn, nine other Republican senators, including Ohio’s Rob Portman and South Carolina’s Lindsay Graham, back the framework proposed red flag grants and all.","Sen.

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has claimed the Democrat-controlled January 6 Committee could come up with criminal charges against former President Donald Trump. The California Democrat alleged Sunday that he has “very powerful” evidence that Trump was responsible for clashes at the US Capitol.“And we’ll be presenting what we’ve found,” Schiff told reporters. “I don’t want to predetermine or prejudge the strength of what we will show you. We’ll show you what we’ve been able to determine.”This comes despite Trump saying he offered to deploy 20,000 National Guards ahead of the protest, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (R-Calif.) rejected his offer.

(Roberto Schmidt/Pool via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:57 AM PT – Tuesday, June 14, 2022Biden administration diplomats have continued to push their influence on world affairs through Asia. On Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a press conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin. The two top diplomats took aim at North Korea.The US-South Korea and North Korea relations have been strained since Joe Biden took over the presidency. Biden has continued to order joint military drills between America and South Korea’s military. This has garnered threats from Kim Jong-un’s regime who have equated those exercises to declarations of war.Last week, Kim called to bolster the country’s military while claiming the international sphere is a “aggravating environment.” The rouge state has launched dozens of ballistic missile tests so far this year and US Intelligence officials warned another test of a nuclear weapon is on the horizon.Secretary Blinken stressed, if North Korea wants to be taken seriously by international leaders then it will have to gain favor through diplomacy.“A nuclear test would be dangerous, it would be deeply destabilizing to the region,” stated the US official. “It would blatantly violate international law as set out in multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, so we urge the DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing activity. We call on the DPRK to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy.”America’s top diplomat went on to say North Koreans could be negatively affected if its government continues its path toward instability.“We want to support the people of North Korea, including with COVID-19 vaccines,” Blinken noted. “Indeed, we have offered our help consistently throughout the pandemic and again during the awful surge that they are now enduring, which comes on top of severe economic and humanitarian crises. Our goal, simply put, is a peaceful and stable region and world. Until the regime in Pyongyang changes course, we will continue to keep the pressure on.”Meanwhile, State Department Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman was sent to Vietnam to cement ties with Hanoi. Sherman touted the US has pledged nearly 20 million to help clean up any unexploded ordinances left over from the Vietnam war. Additionally, she promised to work with Vietnamese officials to combat illegal wildlife trafficking.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman shakes hands with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Monday, June 13, 2022.

Sherman (@DeputySecState) June 13, 2022Additionally, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Thai defense officials in Bangkok. The military leaders discussed modernizing Thailand’s military in several areas, including cyber security and space technology.These discussions were met with the wrath of the Chinese Communist Party who has taken aim at the Biden administration for trying to turn leaders in the region against them. Chinese officials claim that along with engaging in diplomatic relations with Asian officials, the US is also making allegations that China wants to subjugate Taiwanese residents.“The US’ remarks vilifying China will not fool the international community, but only compromise its own credibility,” stated Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin. “We urge the US to match its words with deeds, follow through on its commitment not to seeking confrontation or conflict, not to seeking ‘a new Cold War’ or ‘an Asian version of NATO’ or forming antagonistic blocs in the region.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin.

(AP Photo/Hans Pennink, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:42 AM PT – Tuesday, June 14, 2022New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) signed a bill expanding abortion access in the Empire State. She approved six bills to make her state a “safe haven” for the procedure in case the Supreme Court rules Roe v. Wade to be unconstitutional.“Our heart goes out to the women in those other states, we’ll be there for the women of other states,” stated the governor. “And mark my words, just never, never, here in the state of New York because New York has always been a beacon for those yearning to be free. And I want the world to hear that that will never change”.The laws are intended to provide legal protections for both abortion participants and providers from outside states where the operation may be outlawed, including the prevention of New York authorities from cooperating with outside law enforcement agencies in abortion-related investigations as well as restricting out-of-state medical malpractice insurance claims against New York abortion providers. Additionally, Empire State abortion providers will be immune to professional misconduct charges while institutions that refuse to perform abortions may be sued.Under one of the provisions, abortion providers may even obscure their addresses in order to evade legal action. The governor also announced the formation of a task force that will research the effects of pro-life pregnancy centers. Hochul alleged these protections for abortion are by extension protection for so-called “bodily autonomy.”“Because as the first female governor of New York, I take this personally and that’s a fight I’m willing to take on,” she continued. “Not just on behalf of the women of New York, but for women all across this nation. I refuse to go backwards and I promise you, as long as I’m governor, we will not because these are rights that have been fought for, for generations. And New York State has led every step of the way.”Despite championing bodily autonomy, Hochul maintained former Governor Andrew Cuomo’s health care worker COIVD-19 vaccine mandate,. On top of that, New Yorkers were required to be vaccinated to participate in various indoor activities earlier this year.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court could hand down its decision on Roe as soon as Wednesday. Should the measure be stricken down, each state will have sovereignty over its own abortion policy.","New York Gov.

She also called her decision to let Biden completely control their finances “embarrassing.”“This was one of the harder parts for me to write and to acknowledge,” she explained. “It’s embarrassing to say that I seated all financial control to my husband.”When asked why, Biden’s ex responded with, “I liked the nice things and I didn’t want to think about the cost at which they were coming. Writing this book really helped me to understand how unfair that was to Hunter and how unhealthy that was for me.”Buhle also touched on Biden’s struggles with substance abuse, while suggesting they did not discuss it very often since there was so much shame around the topic.","FILE – Hunter Biden walks with his then-wife Kathleen, along with Vice President Joe Biden and Jill Biden for the internment services for Sen.
