2022-09-01,1:26 PM PT,Heatwave strains California’s power grid,"California is getting scorched by a record-breaking heat-wave. Record temperatures in the Golden State have officials concerned that the state’s power grid won’t keep up with demand. It’s expected to be 10-to-20 degrees warmer than normal across the state throughout this Labor Day weekend, with temperatures reaching 115-degrees in the inland valleys and into the triple digits along the coast. The National Weather Service is calling it an extraordinary heat event.  The sweltering temperatures will have residents cranking up air-conditioners, fans and swamp coolers. The increase in electricity means an added stress on the energy grid. Alice Reynolds, President of California Public Utilities Commission is worried about the complications that might arise from the increased heat. “If we get into an extreme event we’ll see,” Reynolds remarked. “We’re worried, very humble about what might happen.”An ongoing drought has greatly reduced the state’s ability to generate hydroelectric power. This heat-wave will affect the entire western US, so California will be unable to depend on neighboring states for help. In response, Governor Gavin Newsom has proclaimed a state of emergency.“It puts us in a position where we have some vulnerabilities,” Newsom said. “ Uh and that means we need to do things a little bit differently, not just on the demand side to meet that potential peak, particularly coming into this weekend, Sunday and Monday, but also on the supply side.”The California Independent System Operator is taking measures to bring all available resources online. “Restricted maintenance operations” were issued through Tuesday, September sixth in order to ensure all generators and transmission lines are in service.The state’s Grid Manager also issued a “flex alert,” calling on residents to conserve energy in the afternoon and in the evening hours. This means people will be asked to turn thermostats up above 78-degrees, must avoid using large appliances and must not charge their electric vehicles between 4:00 pm and 9:00pm.We are looking at another heat wave in the western United States, including CA. Heat waves may have existed long before climate change, but their duration and intensity have never been more challenging. Visit https://t.co/j4p2wm6Qa3 for more information and ways to stay cool. pic.twitter.com/jlanr3tf7A— Office of the Governor of California (@CAgovernor) September 1, 2022This comes just days after the state finalized regulations to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035, signaling that California’s eyes may be bigger than its stomach as its infrastructure can’t handle its renewable energy ambitions. The state has struggled with rolling blackouts over the past several years after shutting-down all but one of its nuclear power plants. Michael Wara, a lawyer at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment spoke on the topic. “You have to make sure as you shut the dirty thing down, the clean thing is already up and running (and) you’re going to have a problem,” Wara said. “And that was maybe what was exposed a little bit a couple years ago.”Experts are saying this weekend will be a big test for the changes California has made since 2020. ","Above, a hiker walks past the setting sun in Los Angeles, California on August 30, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:54 AM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022The Biden administration has continued to attack supporters of 45th President Donald Trump with another round of divisive statements. Specifically, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday that Republicans “don’t respect the rule of law.”“The MAGA Republicans are the most energized part of the Republican Party,” she stated. “That extreme — this is an extreme threat to our democracy, to our freedom, to our rights.”The extreme MAGA Republicans have made their choice: to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate, and division. We’ve chosen a different path: forward, the future, unity, hope, and optimism. We choose to build a better America.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) August 30, 2022Karine Jean-Pierre also took aim at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene by accusing them of “inciting violence.” This comes as the Biden administration is facing public backlash for comparing MAGA Republicans to “semi-fascists.”“And here’s the thing, the President’s not going to shy away to call out what he clearly sees is happening in this country,” said the White House Press Secretary. “You know, again, MAGA Republicans are this extreme part of their party and that is just facts. And that’s what he’s going to continue to lay out.”Biden: I respect conservative Republicans. I don't respect MAGA Republicans.Translation: I respect neutered Republicans who roll over & do whatever we tell them to. I don’t respect conservatives who feel they have a right to their own opinions & beliefs and give Dems pushback.— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) August 26, 2022This comes as GOP lawmakers suspect political motives behind the Biden FBI raid of Trump’s Florida home while scores of January protesters still face detention and lengthy prison terms.","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:50 AM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022Chicago received the latest bus of migrants courtesy of the Lone Star State. On Wednesday evening, a bus carrying 80 to 100 individuals, largely from Venezuela, pulled into the Windy City’s Union Station. The migrants originally crossed the southern border from Mexico into Texas.The move is part of Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s program to show so-called sanctuary cities the strain of Joe Biden’s border crisis. The governor called upon Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to make good on her promise to accept the new arrivals, regardless of immigration status, and give overrun border towns some much needed relief. Lightfoot bashed the Republican for the stunt while calling it inhumane.“Shame on Governor Abbott,” stated the Chicago mayor. “What he is doing is immoral, unpatriotic and it defies the values of who we are as Americans. We can disagree on policy and politics, but you don’t treat people this way.”First Texas bus of migrants has arrived in Chicago.Biden's inaction at our border puts Texans at risk & is overwhelming our communities.We'll continue bussing migrants to sanctuary cities like NYC, DC, & now Chicago until the federal gov't does its job & secures the border. pic.twitter.com/RccsdIOXiI— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) September 1, 2022Lightfoot may have been right as her city boasted almost 29 murders per 100,000 people in 2020, which is well above the national average of 6.5 per 100,000. Chicago isn’t showing any signs of slowing down as it eclipsed 800 homicides last year, a murder rate not seen in the city since 1994.However, a Lightfoot spokesman said the Windy City will ensure the new arrivals receive “shelter, food, and most importantly protection.” The mayor said Chicago will decide on a more permanent location for the migrants in the coming days.“But in Chicago, we are ready, we are prepared and we will make sure that none of these folks are left in a lurch, but there’s gotta’ be a better way.”Chicago is the third Democrat-run city to receive migrants as New York and Washington D.C. have already been receiving shipments from Texas. Governor Abbott has touted both cities as perfect destinations for migrants, highlighting the services New York Mayor Eric Adams advertised to sanctuary seekers.The migrants who arrived from Texas tonight are getting onto city of Chicago buses now.

2022-09-01,"Caitlin Sinclair — OAN Political Correspondent, New York
9:20 AM PT",New York’s restrictions on handguns start Thursday,"New York’s restrictions on handguns start ThursdayCaitlin Sinclair — OAN Political Correspondent, New YorkUPDATED 9:20 AM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022Starting Thursday, gun owners in New York will not be allowed to carry their firearms into a wide swath of facilities designated by Governor Kathy Hochul as “sensitive” locations.  These New York City areas include public parks, bars, restaurants, mass transit and even Times Square.The law, approved by lawmakers and signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in July, came in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision tossing New York’s previous century-old policy, which only allowed a concealed carry permit if the gun owner could prove they had “proper cause” for one — such as a specific reason they needed to carry a firearm for self-defense.Times Square quickly emerged as a hot button of the debate.If all of Times Square is “a sensitive area,” what exactly is Times Square? Defining the borders became a difficult task from a legal perspective in the gun control fight, and the topic that headlined a New York City Council meeting earlier this weekThe proposed legislation dictates the boundaries of Times Square as Eighth Avenue, West 40th Street, Sixth Avenue and West 53rd Street, as well as the area by Ninth Avenue, West 40th Street, Eighth Avenue and West 48th Street.It will likely be put up for a vote next month, according to a council spokesperson..Governor Kathy Hochul and Adams addressed public safety concerns on Wednesday, saying new provisions of the law will require concealed carry license applicants to meet revised requirements and complete a state-regulated firearms training course.Those new requirements will now require disclosure of social media accounts for new gun applicants.So, if all goes as planned, the new restrictions will impact nearly every gun owner and anyone with an interest in guns in the Empire State.Apart from Times Square, the list of “sensitive areas” includes:Schools, universities, government buildings, places where people have gathered for public protests, health care facilities, places of worship, libraries, public playgrounds and parks, daycare centers, summer camps, addiction and mental health centers, shelters, public transit, bars, theaters, stadiums, museums, polling places and casinos.Ahead of the new law, the NYPD revealed there has been a surge in gun applications.The department said it has received an additional 1,100 handgun applications since the Supreme Court ruling.Meanwhile, Second Amendment groups have filed several lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the new laws and the legislation is expected to be challenged in court.Council members said that in the future, there could be additional designated sensitive areas.TOPICS:Caitlin SinclaircrimeEric Adamsimmigrationkathy hochulNew YorkNew York CitynewsNYCNYPDOANOANNpoliticsSecond AmendmentTimes Square SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/new-yorks-restrictions-on-handguns-start-thursday/
2022-09-01,"Judical Watch — RELEASE
7:25 AM PT",Judicial  Watch: Mass. School District Settles with Coach Fired Over Critical Race Theory,"Judicial  Watch: Mass. School District Settles with Coach Fired Over Critical Race TheoryJudical Watch — RELEASEUPDATED 7:25 AM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch announced today that its client David Flynn, who was removed from his position as head football coach after exercising his right as a parent-citizen to raise concerns about critical race theory and Black Lives Matter propaganda in his daughter’s seventh-grade history class, settled his civil rights lawsuit against his former employers at Dedham Public Schools. As part of the settlement, the Superintendent of Dedham Public Schools, Michael Welch, acknowledged “the important and valid issues” raised by Flynn and specific changes in school policies because of Flynn’s complaint, including banning teachers from promoting Black Lives Matter to students online.The Superintendent’s acknowledgment is the result of a February 2021 lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the superintendent, high school principal, and high school athletic director for retaliating against Flynn for exercising his First Amendment rights (Flynn v. Forrest et al. (No. 21-cv-10256)).The superintendent wrote in the letter that Flynn’s concerns were valid and that the school district is amicable to the settlement:Dear Dave,I hope you and your family are well. I am writing this letter to acknowledge the important and valid issues you raised regarding the Dedham Public Schools and the subsequent lawsuit you filed in federal court. I am pleased that we are able to amicably settle this matter after the recently filed appeal of the court’s decision.First and foremost, I want to acknowledge and validate the concerns you initially raised regarding your daughter’s experiences at Dedham Middle School. You had every right to inquire about these issues, and you followed the appropriate steps in attempting to learn more. You correctly pointed out that the 7th grade social studies curriculum had significantly changed and parents were not informed of these changes. In probing this matter further, you discovered that the district’s website did not accurately reflect the new curriculum content, and parents were unable to understand what was being taught. Your legitimate questions prompted additional conversations at the School Committee level that ultimately led to the establishment of a Curriculum Advisory Committee that now brings together parents, community members, and district educators to broadly review and more thoroughly communicate curriculum changes and concerns. Curriculum updates are a necessary and important part of the work of school districts, and effectively communicating these improvements is a critical component of this process.Your initial inquiry triggered a larger internal conversation about the district’s oversight in the teaching of these new curriculum units. More specifically, the sequencing of the curriculum’s identity unit and the virtual use of a Black Lives Matter emoji t-shirt by a teacher sparked a series of intense conversations about teacher autonomy and the importance of balanced messaging and viewpoints in the classroom. As you pointed out, positive intentions can often have unintended negative impacts on students. Ultimately, I directed staff to remove these t-shirt emojis and instructed them to not wear these in the classroom in the future.Finally, I understand that after you raised these concerns at the classroom level, you left that initial conversation expecting to hear directly from the building principal. It appears this was unclear within the school and you did not hear back in a timely manner. I am sorry for this breakdown. Effective two-way dialogue among parents and school staff is the foundation of mutual trust. While we pride ourselves on this connection, in this particular instance this fueled frustration and identified room for improvement.I regret that these initial justifiable concerns ultimately led to where we are today. As you have indicated, I appreciate your recognition of the opportunity to have improved the trajectory of this sequence. With this settlement, I hope we are able to put any divisions behind us and begin the important work of healing through better conversations and listening.I recognize the school district’s opportunity to improve based upon the issues you have identified, and I thank you for raising them. As educators, I believe we can always learn from our experiences. Thank you for your many years of dedicated commitment to the development of student-athletes in Dedham. Sincerely,Michael J. WelchSuperintendent “This a remarkable victory for Coach Flynn, as his federal civil rights lawsuit resulted in the Dedham School District admitting that he was absolutely right to be concerned about the district’s introducing a new, controversial CRT-style curriculum without parental notice or involvement,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “And, Coach Flynn also appreciates that the teachers will no longer be able to use virtual learning to push Black Lives Matter symbols. It shouldn’t have taken a federal civil rights lawsuit for the school district to do the right thing. We hope other school officials take note they must treat parental curriculum concerns with respect and avoid radical indoctrination of children.”“The past two years have been difficult for me and my family. I thank my family, friends, and everyone else who reached out for their continued support,” said Coach Flynn. “With Judicial Watch’s help, I can move on from this challenging situation knowing that by raising my concerns through the appropriate channels I made a difference for the students and families of Dedham Public Schools. I hope other parents can learn from this and not back down from fighting for what is best for their families.”Judicial Watch lawsuits and FOIA requests on critical race theory and other leftist extremism are extensive:Earlier this month, Judicial Watch sued on behalf of a Minneapolis taxpayer over a teachers’ contract that provides discriminatory job protections to certain racial minorities. The lawsuit was filed against the superintendent of the Minneapolis Public Schools, the Minneapolis Public Schools, and the Minneapolis Board of Education for violating the Equal Protection Guarantee of the Minnesota Constitution.Judicial Watch in July 2022 sued the U.S. Department of Defense for records related to the United States Naval Academy implementing critical race theory in the training of naval recruits.Records produced in April 2022 from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) show the government agency responsible for regulating credit unions required “inclusion and unconscious bias training” for the agency’s employees and contractors and offered advice on how to recognize and address alleged “microaggressions” in the workplace.Records produced in February 2022 from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) included a PowerPoint presentation titled “Race and gender based microaggressions” that was used for training at the organization.Two sets of records obtained by Judicial Watch in November 2021 related to the teaching of critical race theory in Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), Maryland’s largest school system, included a training course with information about a book titled “Antiracist Baby” that introduces the youngest readers to “the concept and power of antiracism,” and says it’s the “perfect gift” for “ages baby to age 3.”Records from Loudoun County, VA, obtained in October 2021 revealed a coordinated effort to advance critical race theory initiatives in Loudoun County public schools despite widespread public opposition.A training document provided to Judicial Watch in October 2021 by a whistleblower in the Westerly School District of Rhode Island, details how its schools are using teachers to push critical race theory in classrooms. The training course was assembled by the left-leaning Highlander Institute and cites quotes from Bettina Love, from whom the Biden administration distanced itself publicly after her statements equating “whiteness” to oppression.Records produced in June 2021 by Wellesley Public Schools in Massachusetts confirmed the use of “affinity spaces” that divide students and staff based on race as a priority and objective of the school district’s “diversity, equity and inclusion” plan. The school district also admitted that between September 1, 2020, and May 17, 2021, it created “five distinct” segregated spaces.Heavily redacted records obtained by Judicial watch in May 2021from Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) in Maryland included documents related to their $454,000 “Anti-racist system audit” and critical race theory classes. Students were taught that the phrase “Make America Great Again” was an example of “covert white supremacy.”TOPICS:Black Lives MatterCritical race theoryCRTDavid FlynnDedham Public SchoolseducationFOIAJudicial WatchnewsOANOANNpoliticsTom Fitton SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/judicial-watch-mass-school-district-settles-civil-rights-lawsuit-with-football-coach-fired-for-objecting-to-critical-race-theory-in-daughters-class/

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:14 AM PT – Wednesday, August 31, 2022As Joe Biden is launching his tour to tout his so-called “achievements” ahead of the midterms, GOP officials are pointing to several disasters seen in the past year and a half of Biden’s reign.During an interview Tuesday, former Trump State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus touched on the crisis of illegal immigration as she toured the southern border. What Ortagus is seeing is the emboldening of drug cartels and human smugglers, who are transporting migrants with near impunity and making billions-of-dollars along the way.She lamented many of the women and children that come through the southern border are raped or assaulted at some point in their journey to America. Ortagus went on to say the mainstream media and Democrat Party are keeping their heads in the sand about immigration issues, while promoting an unrealistic image of open border policies.“Well and this is why the President still has not been here…it’s shameful, right?” she asked. “You can argue about the role of government in many ways. I think something that Republicans and Democrats at least used to agree on is that the role of government is to protect the United States, to protect her citizens and that includes protecting our border. And there’s no good reason why Biden has not been down here.”Conservative women were on the border today with a message to the Biden Administration: stop the war on Latina women and secure the border! pic.twitter.com/5yArbXvuQh— Morgan Ortagus (@MorganOrtagus) August 30, 2022Additionally, GOP Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton is sounding the alarm on the Biden border crisis while calling it a national crisis. He has pointed to reports saying 2 million migrants are flooding the US and hundreds of thousands of Americans are dying from fentanyl overdoses. Cotton stressed that those states show border security is not just a problem for border states.In light of the open border policies espoused by the Democrat Party, the Republican said he’s confident Americans will use the power of the ballot box to change America’s approach to immigration.“Every state is a border state and every town is a border town,” he stated. “… Everywhere I go, people are appalled that the Democrats have basically stopped enforcing and protecting our border. In fact, as you say, they are rewarding and encouraging people to cross the border.”Meanwhile, Cotton derided Joe Biden for bailing out student loan borrowers who cannot pay off their debt, calling his move last week unconstitutional. He pointed out that those who are likely paying for Biden’s program are small business owners and regular Americans who didn’t even go to college.“Those who didn’t go to college, who went to work and who maybe started a job, built a landscape business or pest control business — they aren’t going to benefit from this,”  Cotton asserted. “Men and women who went to college as a waitress or a bartender, who paid their way through. People who joined the Army for the GI bill, served overseas for three, four five years and used the GI bill to go to school. People who took out their loans and repaid those loans or people’s parents who worked hard, maybe worked two jobs or picked up extra shifts to send their kids through college. None of those are going to benefit from this student loan bail out. Finally, I’d like to add there’s a strong whiff of corruption here.”Meanwhile, both Ortagus and Cotton are touting the new generation of conservative congressional candidates that want to make a change to the political establishment. They said congressmembers like Mike Gallagher, Mayra Flores and candidates looking to represent their communities will help rally Americans behind the GOP and help create a red wave come November.","Sen.

2:01 PM PT",Reboot: Pro-Trump reformers ready to replace Ohio GOP chairman,"Reboot: Pro-Trump reformers ready to replace Ohio GOP chairmanNeil W. McCabe, OAN National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 2:01 PM PT – Wednesday, August 31, 2022The vice chairman of the Ohio Republican Party told OAN his and his pro-Trump allies have the votes to oust Robert A. Paduchik as the chairman of the state party at the Sept. 9 meeting of the party’s Central Committee.“I’m running for state party chairman to replace Bob Paduchik,” said Bryan C. Williams, who served in as a state representative and is now a member of the University of Akron’s board of trustees.Williams said he met with the chairman three weeks after the Aug. 2 Central Committee elections, so he could tell him that he would launch his challenge.The vice-chairman said he supported Paduchik to replace Jane Timken in February 2021, when Timken resigned to run for the Senate. At the time, Williams was the acting chairman, but he felt Paduchik’s skills and experience running grassroots campaigns would help the party stay connected with the voters.Unfortunately, once the chairman got the job, it was as if the state party central committee hired Paduchik and then Paduchik fired the committee, he said.“He has not followed our party bylaws, and he’s done it to the detriment of those who want a more open, more collaborative and more inclusive process,” he said.Paduchik has for months been blocking reformers, removing them from committees, and refusing to appoint new members to committee assignments.“With Bob it’s immediately my way, the highway. You don’t do what I want, you’re dead to meet. Lose my phone number, don’t call me—and for those of us who are on the committee, we can’t let that continue because it’s going to hurt the party in the long run,” he said.Williams said he was aware of the millions of dollars in write-offs from the party’s books, but the former state legislator does not believe money was stolen, but it is true the party’s books are a mess.“I think that the records that we are given do not tie back,” he said. “We get these QuickBook spreadsheets that don’t tie back to previous meetings, and they don’t reconcile over from one year end to another year-end–and those are legitimate necessary questions for the finance committee members to make and ask.”Going into the November midterms, the Ohio Republican Party must reboot and reconnect with its voters, so the party can ramp enthusiasm with Trump supporters boxed out by Paduchik and his staff,” he said.Williams said this was brought home to him with he had a conversation with one of the party’s statewide candidates.“Right now, there’s an enthusiasm gap with conservatives in Ohio. I was just talking to one of the statewides, and it was telling me about the polling numbers and saying that the conservatives do not have this turnout enthusiasm that a lot of the Democrats have and they’re wondering why,” he said.“I said: ‘Well, I think the conduct of the state party contributes to that because we’ve had nothing for Pro-Trump Republicans by the state party organization, they get put down, they get put down, to they get put down.’”TOPICS:Bob PaduchikBryan WilliamsGOPJane TimkenNeil W.

(AP Photo/David Longstreath, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:33 PM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022The passing of former USSR leader Mikhail Gorbachev has started a debate over his legacy amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The death of Mikhail Gorbachev, which was reported on the Russian Newswires on Wednesday evening, sparked a renewed debate of Russia’s past and future. The former President remained a polarizing figure in Russian society over his role in the demise of the Soviet Empire. His passing at the age of 91 marked the end of an era that changed the history of Russia and the world. “We need more enterprise, more democracy, more organization and discipline, then we will be able to bring Perestroika up to full speed and give new impetus to developing socialism,” Gorbachev said.Upon his appointment as the CPSU General-Secretary in 1985, Gorbachev became the youngest official to lead the Communist Party and the Country. At the time he was only 54-years-old and his promise of accelerating the economy, de-escalating international tensions and cracking down on alcohol consumption laid the foundation for a new course for Russia known as Perestroika. “I’ll tell you this, nowadays there are no firing cannons, and bombs are not exploding, but we live in very important times,” Gorbachev remarked.Just six-years later, the Soviet economy grounded to a halt. The country disassembled into 16-separate-republics and the Red Empire was no more. It was an experience that is still seen as traumatizing in Russian society. In international affairs, Gorbachev, along with President Ronald Reagan achieved what seemed impossible only a few years prior. During the Perestroika, the Soviet Union and the United States struck a number of arms-control treaties along with mutual agreements to improve relations and reduce tensions. Former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev has passed away.Click the link below to view more photographs from his summits and meetings with #PresidentReagan.https://t.co/GoupwKnory pic.twitter.com/kF7apjcQ8M— RonaldReaganLibrary (@Reagan_Library) August 30, 2022The Accords were seen as gestures of goodwill at the time. However, they have since be proven to disrupt the balance of power in the world leading to the expansion of NATO in Europe and arguably the current crisis in Ukraine. The economic and social turmoil resulting from Perestroika largely subsided by the year 2000. Presidential terms of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev marked a rebound of the Russian economy. The nation was globally recognized as the successor of the Soviet Union and it began to restore its international influence. It was an effort that was met with stiff resistance from the Western World. “The NATO documents it officially we are declared the main threat… and we don’t want to believe that, but this is so,” Putin said.Despite Gorbachev’s best efforts to preserve the Soviet Union by reforming it, his methods of diplomacy and economic-and-political-compromise did not work to the country’s benefit. Today, the Russian government says it’s working to restore what was lost in the Perestroika turmoil with methods different than Gorbachev’s.","Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev addresses a group of 150 business executives in San Francisco, Monday, June 5, 1990.

2022-09-01,5:20 PM PT,Police using ad-based software to track phones,"Police using ad-based software to track phonesAP Illustration/Peter HamlinOAN NewsroomUPDATED 5:20 PM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022Law enforcement agencies across the nation are using a powerful piece of software to track Americans’ phones.The program known as Fog Reveal, has been used to search billions of records from mobile devices and harnesses the data to create analyses known among law enforcement as “patterns of life.” Davin Hall, a former police data analyst, spoke in detail about the software.“You can see all of the locations that it’s been,” Hall said. “You can see where it’s moving around. You can see where it’s stopping. You can see where people, um, where people live, where people work.”Sold by Fog Data Science LLC, Fog revealed that it has been used since 2018 in criminal investigations, although the tool is rarely mentioned in court records which defense attorneys say makes it harder for them to properly defend their clients in cases in which the technology was used. “That ad ID number will ping periodically,” Hall said. “And it gives off the number, the time and the location in that ping.”The program takes advantage of the fact that every mobile device is assigned a unique advertising identification number. This allows apps with location services to target consumers with promotions. For as little as $7,500 dollars a year, Fog Data Science offers the service. The service uses ad-ID to track a device’s path when location services are enabled. However, the concern is that most of the time officers can use Fog Reveal without a warrant to search for personal information about nearly anyone.“I don’t think it should be used by law enforcement,” Hall remarked. “And at the very least, I think people should be aware that it is being used, and that this kind of surveillance is going on.”The Electronic Frontier Foundation led an investigation into how the program is used. It was found that Fog Data Science has created a search engine for officers to create geo-fenced device searches to find the so-called “patterns of life.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) countered the claim that Fog’s product only contains anonymous data and no personally identifiable information. Bennett Cyphers, a technologist at Electronic Frontier Foundation spoke on the topic. “The Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect us from being spied on by the government. It’s supposed to mean that the government can’t go into your phone and take out intimate data about your life without legal process,” said Cyphers. “So, if police aren’t using, aren’t acquiring warrants before using a service like Fog, that’s essentially buying their way around the Fourth Amendment.”Fog Reveal has successfully been used to solve multiple missing person and murder cases. The cases include a hit and run and the case of Sydney Sutherland, a 25-year-old nurse who was kidnapped and killed in Arkansas in 2020. Arkansas prosecutor, Kevin Metcalf, is using this as evidence to advocate for the use of Fog Reveal in law enforcement.“If we do use the very sensitive date, we’re looking at: Is somebody in danger?” Is a life in danger? asked Metcalf. “That’s what we, we push the limits on investigative methodology. How does technology apply, and where does that technology connect to other technologies and open-source data and legal process.”Fog claimed in a written response to the Associated Press that it cannot disclose information about its customers, but it does not access or have anything to do with personally identifiable information and is merely leveraging commercially available data.",AP Illustration/Peter Hamlin,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AP22236706319849.jpg, Patel: FBI Seeking Revenge For Failed Russia Collusion HoaxTOPICS:fog reveallaw enforcementnewsOANOANNphonespolicesoftwaretracking SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/police-using-ad-based-software-to-track-phones/

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:16 AM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022The Biden administration announces a slew of new funding to help schools fill their empty teaching positions. While speaking at the White House Wednesday, Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh said the White House will be investing over $100 million to fund teaching apprenticeships on top of their prior investment of $383 million.Experts point to the COVID-19 lockdowns, teacher burnout and low-pay as the primary reasons behind the current staffing shortage. This is in spite of the existence of teacher’s unions who routinely bargained for higher wages and fought against any attempt to return to in-person learning during the pandemic.“This administration has invested over $383 million in apprenticeships already in a very short period of time,” said Walsh. “Our next round of apprenticeship funding will be over $100 million. We’re going to prioritize education in the education sector as an opportunity for those funds to help address a national need and, quite honestly, a crisis and open up educational opportunities around the country.”Additionally, they sent out a joint letter to state and local school districts, which laid out what steps should be taken to entice more people to get their teaching credentials. This includes using funds from the $1.9 trillion relief package Joe Biden released earlier this year to increase wages.“This letter that we put out there, encouraging to take a series of actions to address the teacher shortage and school staff shortages in our country,” Walsh noted. “Now, this was not created by the pandemic. It was happening before the pandemic. The pandemic just shined a light on it.”Pay teachers a livable and competitive wage.@SecCardona and I are encouraging governors and district leaders to use funds in the American Rescue Plan and the $350 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery funds to increase teacher pay and reduce high turnover rates.— Secretary Marty Walsh (@SecMartyWalsh) August 31, 2022Present for the announcement was First Lady Jill Biden who vowed to continue supporting teachers by advocating for increased wages.“There are so many other future educators out there who want to teach, but decide against it or decide to leave because so many obstacles stand in their way,” said Mrs. Biden. “And we’ve seen that this summer. And if we want to draw more, bright, talented people into the field. If we want educators to be able to do what they do best, we have to give them the pay and the support that they need.”This comes as a new survey showed over 94 percent of political donations from teachers unions went to Democrat lawmakers.","FILE – In this March 13, 2020 file photo, then-Boston Mayor Marty Walsh talks about the postponement of the Boston Marathon during a news conference, in Boston.

The Nord Stream pipeline runs through the Baltic Sea and will supply Europe with natural gas from Russia. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:55 PM PT – Thursday, September 1, 2022The White House continues to wage war on Russian energy as the Kremlin reportedly shuts off its Nord Stream 1 pipeline. During a virtual call to the press on Wednesday, White House National Security Council Spokesperson, John Kirby, accused the Kremlin of weaponizing energy. This comes after Russian Energy Officials shut down its exports of gas to Germany from the Nord Stream 1 Pipeline for three-days, citing maintenance work for the pipeline. NSC spokesperson Kirby stressed that the Biden administration has plotted a contingency plan for this situation. “And that’s why President Biden set up a task force with the EU back in March to work on ways to increase alternate sources of natural gas to Europe, including from the United States, and to help reduce Europe’s demand for Russian energy due to increased efficiency and clean energy deployment,” Kirby said.Expert analyses claimed that amid the West’s war on Russia, Europe is trying to fill its liquefied natural gas (LNG) reservoirs with gas from the United States, West Africa and from the Middle East. Kirby stated that the US contributes two-thirds of global exports of LNG to Europe, adding that the total increased by nearly 20-billion-cubic-meters compared to last year. Kirby also added that the Biden administration is nowhere near the level of fuel exports it wants to send to European allies.“That said, we’re pragmatic about this and we know that there’s more work to do. So we’re going to keep looking for ways to increase gas stockpiles in Europe or to help bolster other sources of energy where it’s possible,” Kirby said. “We commend the leadership and the solidarity that Europe has shown on energy issues. And those efforts to prepare for winter have already had a positive effect.”Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen traveled across the pond in order to shore up support for a possible price cap on Russian oil with her counterpart in the United Kingdom. She continued to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the global increase of gas prices. She alleged that prices shot up as a result of his invasion into Ukraine. Yellen said the price cap would effectively punish Putin while cementing the ousting of Russia’s influence on Europe’s gas market. “The price cap will advance our two key objectives,” Yellen said. “The first, of course, is reducing revenues that Putin needs to continue waging his war of aggression. And the second is maintaining a reliable supply of oil to the global market and putting downward pressure on the price of energy for people in the US, in the UK and around the world.”I was pleased to meet with Chancellor Zahawi @nadhimzahawi today to discuss shared priorities, including a price cap on Russian oil to deny Putin revenue to fund his brutal war and put downward pressure on energy prices for consumers and businesses in the U.S., UK, and globally. pic.twitter.com/vcAswEvEuw— Secretary Janet Yellen (@SecYellen) August 31, 2022The UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi, commended Yellen’s pledge. He added that it should help the West achieve its real priority of funding Ukraine’s resistance to Russia. “On Ukraine financing, we strongly welcome what you have delivered the substantial package of over $8 billion, $8.5 billion of economic support for the Ukraine, as well as the intention to provide further support,” Zahawi said. “I met today with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank to continue to make sure we have every lever possible for that rapid disbursement of support to Ukraine over the autumn.”In the meantime, officials from Europe’s main energy hub, Germany, said that they have enough resources to get by for the three-days Nord Stream 1 is down. However, some leaders worry the shutoff could be extended past Saturday. Additionally, America is looking to cement its status as top LNG exporter to Europe, building off of trade relations developed amid the Ukraine crisis. Critics of the West say leaders in the US and Europe are trying to push fossil fuels out of their energy markets and opt in for globalist approved green energy alternatives. They said that the participating countries don’t have enough so-called green energy to completely ditch oil and gas. They also added that they are put in a bad position when energy exporters do shut off their spigots.The White House plans to host the G7 leaders on Friday. There, they will discuss the implementation of a gas cap for Russia. ","LUBMIN, GERMANY – NOVEMBER 08: A man wearing a hard hat walks by the central facility where the Nord Stream Baltic Sea gas pipeline reaches western Europe following the pipeline’s official inauguration on November 8, 2011 in Lubmin, Germany.
