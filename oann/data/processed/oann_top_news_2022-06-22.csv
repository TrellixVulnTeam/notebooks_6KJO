12:53 PM PT",Govt. Economists fail to say recession is coming,"The messaging seems to be clear among economists within the Biden administration: don’t say recession. They appear to be reluctant to say a recession is looming, despite warning the economy is likely to slow down.Several of Biden’s economists were scattered around on several corporate news outlets, where they asserted inflation will likely “not come down to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target” and the US economy will “slow down” yet a recession is “not inevitable.”Together, we've made extraordinary progress in laying a new foundation for our economy. But there's still so much at stake. pic.twitter.com/0hcrgpdTGs— President Biden (@POTUS) June 20, 2022President of the Cleveland Fed, Loretta Mester said she agreed with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that the Central Bank cannot do much more than it already has done. Powell announced last week that the Fed is going to hike the interest rate by 75 basis points, which is 50 percent more than they originally planned.Mester asserted, this will aim to moderate demand for goods and services, so that it can get back in balance with the supply side of the economy. However, she went on to blame external factors for high prices of gas, while pointing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“Of course there are other things going on as well,” said Mester. The Ukraine situation which is a tragedy has really led to the prices. Other things were moving on the supply side as well. No doubt, supply conditions remain constrained longer than I think anyone thought.”Meanwhile, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen echoed the administration’s talking point that the economy under Biden was booming until it suddenly went bust. Yellen claimed the labor market is the strongest in decades, despite record number of people quitting their jobs. She also blamed Russia for America’s high energy and food prices. She stressed, the only way to manage the economic crises is to submit to Biden’s climate agenda.“I think that producers were partly caught unaware by the strength of the recovery in the economy and weren’t ready to meet the needs of the economy,” Yellen expressed. “High prices should induce them to increase supplies over time and look at some medium term matter. The way in which we can assure reasonable energy expenses for household is to move to renewables, to address climate change. That’s the way to free us from GO political movements and gas prices.”Additionally, Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese downplayed the negative impacts of Biden’s economic policies. He noted the long discredited practice of calling the sky high inflation rates as “transitory” and also tried to say there are immensely positive things Biden has done.“We need to navigate through this transition in a way that gets us to stable growth without giving up on all the economic gains that we’ve made,” expressed Deese.However, former the US Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, said a recession is in fact on the horizon. Many experts have credited Summers as one of the most prophetic critics who accurately predicted the economic crises coming into fruition. He asserted that record inflation, food and energy prices are all signs that point to a recession. The former top economist said there are several things the government can do to pullout of the economic crisis.“If at long last we can have some kind of bipartisan budget bill with three elements,” stated Summers. “Reduction of pharmaceutical prices put in place, the partial repeal of the Trump tax cuts and more energy supply approach.” In the meantime, the Fed is gearing up to unleash another massive interest rate hike if the inflation rate that will continue to soar. Critics of the Biden administration have urged officials to stop playing the blame game and work towards fixing their mistakes.Several polls have shown American voters are looking to make a change in the midterm elections. They want to see better economic policies in America","U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (right) meets with Canadian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland in Toronto, on Monday, June 20, 2022.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:23 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022Staffing issues forced American Airlines to cut service to three US cities. Beginning September 7, American will no longer offer service to Toledo, Ohio, Ithaca, New York and Islip, New York. This due to pilot shortages.“In response to the regional pilot shortage affecting the airline industry, American Airlines has made the difficult decision to end service,” American Airlines spokeswoman Andrea Koos said in a statement. “We’re extremely grateful for the care and service our team members provided to our customers in Islip, Ithaca and Toledo and are working closely with them during this time.”The decision came on the heels of thousands of flight cancellations and delays in recent months. More and more people are traveling for the first time since the pandemic, putting a strain on the industry. The airline also said they are making changes to eight other routes, which they claim will better match the current demand environment.“The new PSA agreements will not only help PSA hire and retain quality pilots, but will set the standard for other regional carriers to follow suit,” John Ebbert, chair of the ALPA’s PSA pilot group stated.Multiple airlines have begun to cut flights from their daily schedule. Delta Airlines cut 100 flights between July 1 and August 7. Southwest Airlines cut 20,00 flights.Large numbers of Americans are taking trips for the first time since the start of the pandemic. This has caused travel demand to surge. The Transportation Security Administration said it screened about 2.44 million people at airports on Friday, a total greater than any other day since November 28, 2021.Airline executives are also struggling to keep up with rising fuel costs,  which has left them little choice but to increase fares.","A passenger wearing a mask enters a line to drop off his bag with Delta airlines at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Tuesday, April 19, 2022, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:30 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022A top House Democrat is already making contingency plans for if President Joe Biden decides not to run in 2024 elections. Speaking on CNN on Monday, House Democrat Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said his number one choice to replace Biden on the Democrat ticket would be his Border Czar Kamala Harris. He went on to backpedal his position and claimed “a Biden presidency is what America needs right now.”“You know, there’s no question in my mind that Joe Biden is doing exactly what needs to be done for this great country of ours,” Clyburn replied. “We all know that our Democracy is teetering on edge. We need a Joe Biden to get us through this rough patch and I think he’s doing great with that. We know that his forecast includes Vice President Harris. I support her. I’m just saying that if he chooses not to run again, first on my list after him would be Kamala Harris.”This comes amid reports that Democrats are increasingly skeptical of a possible Biden run in 2024, as he has vowed to run again. Democrats are also expected to lose in this year’s midterms. American’s have began  to decry Biden’s handling of the economy, foreign policy and the social issues facing of America.“I think a lot depends upon what the issues are after the midterm elections,” he explained. “What kind of impact his policies will have on the outcome of that election and I think that he will make a decision based upon that. I think that Democratic voters will be doing that as well. Everybody knows that none of us are getting any younger. We all tend to adjust our activities based upon what time it is at any given juncture. He’ll do the same.”However, Clyburn did admit that Biden is at an advanced age and he may not be up for a second term.","Chairman Rep.

(Photo/Butch Dill, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:03 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022Trump-endorsed Katie Britt (R) made her final plea to voters. She made her case for why she is the best candidate to serve as US Senate seat in Alabama and aimed to take on Washington elites. As she spoke to Breitbart News, the Trump-backed candidate stressed she will fight for the hardworking people of the Cotton State.Britt said she has shifted along with Republican voters from a party run by big business to a party run by the people. She lamented, people in Washington don’t get the struggles of the average American.“I think these career politicians just don’t get it anymore,” expressed Britt. They’ve been there too long and they just don’t understand what hard working people are going through. People cannot afford gas. We must become not only energy independent, but energy dominant. Every dollar the government spends, the dollar in our pocket is worthless.”Britt went on to vow to bring back several America First policies, especially when it comes to securing the southern border. She said President Joe Biden’s failed foreign policies in countries, including Afghanistan are exacerbating the migrant crisis and are radicalizing terrorists who are illegally entering the US. Additionally, Britt said she will work to pass legislation that aims to reduce immigration and create a merit based system for foreigners to become American citizens.“You can go all the way back to Ted Kennedy’s 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act,” she voiced. You see the shift that occurred there and it wasn’t for the better. We’ve got to stand up for hard working Alabamians and Americans. We got to end the chain migration system and create an actual merit based immigration system. We’ve got to find a way to increase wages so that people can provide for their family and have a pathway to success.”Meanwhile, several Republicans have backed Britt’s bid for Senate in favor of her primary opponent and current Congressman Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). Trump unendorsed Brooks earlier this year over the Representative’s lackluster stance on election integrity and lambasted him for having no loyalties but to himself.However, after Britt got the “Trump bump” she received glowing endorsements from high profile Republicans, including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C) and Trump’s former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Several America First candidates, including Adam Laxalt (R) in Nevada, Doug Mastriano (R) in Pennsylvania and JD Vance (R) in Ohio, won in their primaries and are headed to the November general election.

While speaking to reporters at a Delaware beach Monday, he defended his approach to runaway inflation and his so-called “clean” energy policies.“My dear mother used to have this expression: for everything lousy, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it.,” Biden stated. “We have a chance here to make a fundamental turn towards renewable energy. Electric vehicles. Not just electric vehicles, but across the board.”His comments were immediately interpreted as “tone deaf” to most Americans, who are now paying more than $5 a gallon for gas.

John Kennedy, R-La., speaks during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing to examine the American Jobs Plan, focusing on infrastructure, climate change, and investing in our nation’s future on Tuesday, April 20, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Oliver Contreras/The Washington Post via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:54 AM PT – Tuesday, June 21 2022Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) recently criticized mainstream media for trying to stir up partisan hatred against Republicans. During a Monday interview, the Louisiana lawmaker specifically decried the actions of staffers working for “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”Last week, a group of seven CBS employees were arrested for walking the halls of the US Capitol without badges. They were reportedly trying to catch Republican lawmakers off guard, while attempting to interview them through the “dog puppet” character called “Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.”Kennedy said the American people know this was an attempt to make Republicans look bad. He added, Americans don’t take mainstream media seriously.“I’ve said it in another context, that’s why the American people — they are not fooled,” stated the Republican. “They trust the media now like they trust gas station sushi. And the media, everybody knows that — not everybody, but many members of the media — have no self-awareness. They think they are fooling the American people.”Sen. Kennedy also said narratives curated by mainstream media are fueling hysterical outcries against conservatives. These include protests outside the homes of Supreme Court justices violent unrest and cancel culture.Colbert defended his staff during an episode of the show following their arrest by Capitol Police. He noted authorities are more cautious now while alluding the reasoning to be on part of the January 6 protests. Nonetheless, the seven staffers were charged with unlawful entry after disturbance call.According to a Capitol Police statement, “This is an active criminal investigation and may result in additional criminal charges after consultation with the U.S. Attorney.”","Sen.

Just in the month of May, Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 14,000 of unaccompanied minors. This represents an increase of nearly 22 percent since April and the largest month since July 2021, which peaked to nearly 19,000.Although Biden plans to combat the crisis with his Los Angeles declaration plan, analysts doubt his measures will make any difference as they do not appear to directly address the issue.“First, stability and assistance, making sure that communities welcoming refugees can afford to care for them, to educate them, medical care, shelter and job opportunities,” stated the President. “Second, increasing pathways for legal migration throughout the region as well as protections for refugees.”Other countries know they can disrespect our laws and our President without consequence. At his disastrous summit, President Biden declared, “We are transforming our approach to MANAGE migration.” But we don’t need to manage illegal migration—We Need to Shut it Down Completely.— Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) June 14, 2022However, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) made additional efforts to protect his state from Biden’s immigration crisis. On Friday, he directly addressed the issue announcing his petition to the Florida Supreme Court to create a statewide grand jury to investigate human smuggling networks.“The purpose of the grand jury will be to investigate individuals and organizations that are actively working with foreign nationals, drug cartels, coyotes to illegally smuggle minors, some as young as two-years-old across the border and into Florida,” DeSantis explained. “This is just wrong what they’re doing and we are going to go after it. The grand jury will also investigate the methods that these smugglers use to transport so-called unaccompanied alien children across the southern border and any criminal activity that is associated with these operations.”Among his other initiatives is to sign a bill that penalizes contractors hired by the federal government that transports unauthorized immigrants to Florida.In Florida, we are taking action to protect our state from Biden's Border Crisis. pic.twitter.com/bd6LAAWNYn— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 17, 2022In Biden’s fiscal year of 2021 alone, the Customs and Border Protection reported 1.7 million encounters with illegal migrants at the southern border, which is the highest number ever recorded in a single year. This came despite his pledge to fix the immigration crisis he claimed former President Donald Trump.Currently, the average number of unaccompanied children apprehended is nearly 14,000 per month.","Migrants cross the border between the U.S. and Mexico at the Rio Grande river, as they enter El Paso, Texas.  (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/border.jpg, No Research Shows ‘Significant Benefit’ For Kids To Take VaccineTOPICS:Border CrisisBorder PatrolBorder Securityborder wallCBPCustoms and Border ProtectionDonald TrumpimmigrationLos AngelesMigrant children crossings rising at southern bordernewsOANOANNpoliticsRon DesantisSouthern borderunaccompanied migrant children SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/migrant-children-crossings-rising-at-southern-border/

According to data collected by Civiqs, Biden’s job approval fell to 32 percent in June, which down from 34 percent in May. This marks its lowest level since the Democrat took office last year.A whopping 57 percent of respondents said they do not approve of Biden’s job performance. In addition to this, the President’s net approval ratings are now negative in 48 states, which is up from 47 states last month with the exception of Hawaii and Vermont. Biden now has a national net approval rating of -25 and most respondents are concerned about his poor handling of the economy.New @dailykos/@Civiqs poll: Many Democrats feel disappointed with President Biden.Percent of Ds who agree: “When President Biden took office, I thought he was going to do more to help people like me.”Democrats, total: 44%Democrats, age 18-34: 62%https://t.co/fBYvhAakeB— Civiqs (@Civiqs) April 28, 2022Meanwhile, Biden’s officials have continued to downplay risks of an economic downturn, despite economists warning of 72 percent odds of a recession. In an interview Sunday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen claimed consumer spending is strong and it supports economic growth, despite shrinking household incomes.“It’s natural now that we expect a transition to steady and stable growth, but I don’t think a recession is at all inevitable,” Yellen asserted.Economists have said rising federal interest rates and runaway inflation are undermining financial well-being of Americans. In the meantime, investors have said a recession is likely. According to Bloomberg Economics models, the odds of this happening is now at 72 percent.The recession is here:-The stock market sold off-Almost NO small business confidence-Zero GDP Growth -Inflation at 8 to 10 percent Brace for impact!— Stephen Moore (@StephenMoore) June 17, 2022Despite all the warnings, Yellen also called to remove some tariffs on China that were imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018 as the Biden administration claims such restrictions serve “no strategic purpose.”","President Joe Biden reacts when asked how he was feeling as he leaves St. Edmund Roman Catholic Church in Rehoboth Beach, Del., after attending a Mass, Saturday, June 18, 2022.
