Despite this, Chinese diplomats have repeatedly denied the harsh treatment of Uyghurs, specifically during Bachelet‚Äôs visit‚ÄúXinjiang is not at all a human rights issue, but a major issue concerning upholding national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,‚Äù Haley stated. ‚ÄúClouds cannot overshadow the sun and truth will debunk all lies.

On Wednesday, the Georgia Department of Health said it‚Äôs looking into the Peach State‚Äôs first possible case of monkeypox in a man with a history of international travel.In addition to that case, the New York Health Department reported two more people tested positive for the virus. New York City confirmed it‚Äôs first case of monkeypox last month.

Adm. Karl L. Schultz is being relieved by Adm. Linda Fagan as the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:23 AM PT ‚Äì Wednesday, June 1, 2022President Joe Biden is reportedly upset with his administration‚Äôs handling of the highest inflation in decades. According to a Washington Post report published on Wednesday, over the past several months Biden has privately sounded off about how White House aides are not sufficiently addressing inflation.Biden was said to have told aides they are not doing enough to explain what is causing inflation and what they are doing to reduce it. The President‚Äôs reported frustration comes as recent polls indicate most Americans do not approve of his handling of inflation or the economy as a whole.Despite this, Biden administration economists have said the looming economic recession is nothing to worry about. Administration officials appear to be keeping their heads in the ground as the US economy is on its way to catastrophe. At the White House and on corporate networks Tuesday, several of President Biden‚Äôs economic advisors tried to downplay the severity of rampant inflation and chocked supply chain.Director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese echoed the long defunct talking point that the economy is in a ‚Äútransitory period.‚Äù Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell blasted officials for using that term last year. At that time, he said it was too late in the game to call the crisis transitory. That didn‚Äôt stop Deese from downplaying the economic woes experienced at the hands of the Biden administration while also claiming the US economy is in a good place.‚ÄúThe economy we have right now is in a transition from this period of historical economic growth to a period that can be more stable, resilient growth,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúThat required focusing on inflation and doing so from a position of relative strength. The US is in a better position to do so in part because of the strength of our labor market recovery, the strength of household balance sheets.‚ÄùNational Economic Council director Brian Deese speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, May 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)However, the numbers show the economy is not in a good place. Economists have lamented the inflation rate is at a more than 40-year high. Additionally, gas prices have soared since Biden occupied the Oval Office with national averages exceeding $4.00 and in California more than $6.00. It appears that those prices keep hitting record highs week after week. Other experts have pointed to the problems with the supply chain that is causing store shelves to run dry and is keeping baby formula from nurturing children.Recently, Powell warned Americans are going to feel some more pain while the central bank posits to fight inflation. However, the Biden administration appears to be incapable of admitting its mistakes. Instead, Biden officials have continued to blame COVID-19 and Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin for America‚Äôs crumbling economy.‚ÄúWhat we understood about inflation at the time was that it was tied to the pandemic, said chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Cecilia Rouse, PH.D. ‚ÄúWe are still in the midst of this pandemic. Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine disabled not only gas prices and food prices, but also disrupted supply chains. We didn‚Äôt foresee Delta, we didn‚Äôt forsee Omicron. And So, yes, there have been unexpected challenges, which have disrupted getting us back to the natural equilibrium that would help bring down those prices.‚ÄùThere is one Biden administration official who is taking responsibility for her miscalculations. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters that she was wrong to say inflation would not snowball in several interviews last year. She admitted there were several Biden administration programs, including massive spending bills, energy cutting policiesand insufficient supply chain, that contributed to the economic crisis.However, Yellen and President Biden have said the administration is not ready to correct course and is deferring responsibility to the Federal Reserve. The Treasury secretary said the fed will have to lead the way on combatting inflation and the rest of the Biden administration will follow suit.‚ÄúAnd for our part, President Biden is focused on supplementing what the Fed does with actions we can take to lower the costs that American face for important expenditures they have in their budgets,‚Äù Yellen stated.In the meantime, Powell has vowed to wage war on inflation until the Consumer Price Index returns the Fed‚Äôs target at 2 percent. Some economists and lawmakers warned a recession could come in the coming months if the Biden administration fails to take hold of inflation.","President Joe Biden participates in a change of command ceremony at U.S. Coast Guard headquarters, Wednesday, June 1, 2022, in Washington.

(Patrick Doyle/The Canadian Press via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:20 AM PT ‚Äì Wednesday, June 1, 2022A gun shop owner in British Columbia said Canada‚Äôs hand gun ownership freeze punishes law-abiding citizens, while the government rewards criminals. Matt Mendel, the co-owner of Wanstall‚Äôs Hunting & Shooting, strongly disagrees with the sweeping declaration by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The legislation freezes the buying, selling and transfers of handguns between consenting parties until further notice. Mendel thinks the order is unlikely to decrease violence in Canada as most weapons used at crime scenes are obtained illegally. He lamented the measure will greatly reduce his sales volume, in turn, diminishing the recreational shooting industry from year-round to seasonal.‚ÄúThis does not do anything to address the illegal firearms that are being picked up after the scene of the crime where 82 percent of them are smuggled in coming from the United States,‚Äù explained the gun shop owner. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a waste of resources that could be better allocated towards anti-trafficking, for example.‚ÄùWhile addressing the Canadian Parliament on Tuesday, Conservative Party Leader Candice Bergen found it hypocritical for Trudeau‚Äôs government to punish law-abiding citizens, while simultaneously loosening repercussions for criminals.‚ÄúOn one hand, they‚Äôre banning handguns,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, they‚Äôre pushing through Bill C-5, which tells criminals, don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre convicted of a gun crime, you just hang out at home for your sentence. This is not keeping community safe, and it is not reassuring to moms and dads who are worried about their kids.‚ÄùBill C-5, which was proposed late last year, removes minimal sentencing for a number of gun-related crimes, excluding the usage of a firearm in connection to a criminal organization. Trudeau, however, doubled down on his progressive policy, while claiming it will fix the inequitable composition of Canada‚Äôs penal system.‚ÄúThe Bill C-5 legislation does not stop police from charging people with gun offences or prosecutors from pursuing convictions,‚Äù claimed the prime minister. ‚ÄúWhat it does do is make sure criminals face serious penalties, while addressing the overrepresentation of black Canadians and indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system.‚ÄùThe legislation, pushed forward by Trudeau on Monda,y will also limit magazines to a five-round capacity and even ban toys resembling guns. Additionally, Canada‚Äôs public safety minister also announced a mandatory buyback program for so-called assault weapons later this year.Despite years of more gun control, bans, buybacks, and nearly a billion dollars spent, gun violence continues to go up in Canada. Today Trudeau doubled down on his failed approach and again promised Canadians it will keep them safe. It won‚Äôt, just as it hasn‚Äôt for years. #cdnpoli‚Äî Raquel Dancho (@RaquelDancho) May 30, 2022Conservative MP, Raquel Dancho blasted the move on Twitter, while claiming Canada‚Äôs crime rate has been rising despite years of gun bans and buy-backs.

Investor Stephen Schork said rising prices on natural gas are driving fuel and heating prices, while also contributing to rising food prices. He believes ‚Äúthe war on natural gas is a war on the American consumer.‚Äù‚ÄúSo the inflation has not peaked‚Ä¶and this is the problem, runaway inflation at the gas pump and the grocery counter has been the lead indicator for recession of the last six recessions in the United States,‚Äù Schork explained.As a result, US consumers are facing shrinking incomes and worse quality of life. The US economy shrank nearly 1.5 percent in the first quarter, which has added to the fears of a broader economic downturn this year.","FILE ‚Äì In this May 13, 2020, file photo, Tesla cars are loaded onto carriers at the Tesla electric car plant in Fremont, Calif.¬† the Golden State wants electric vehicle sales to triple in the next four years to 35 percent of all new car purchases.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:43 PM PT ‚Äì Thursday, June 2, 2022President Joe Biden addressed the ongoing baby formula shortage as parents nationwide are struggling to feed their infants. While speaking to reporters at the White House Wednesday, he detailed his efforts to help get more formula onto store shelves.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt let up in the infant formula market until its back to normal,‚Äù said Biden. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take a couple more months, but we‚Äôre making significant process.‚ÄùThe shortage came after the Abbot baby formula plant in Michigan was shutdown. The shutdown, which took place in February, was due to two infant deaths linked to unsanitary conditions and practices at the facility.‚ÄúWe launched Operation Fly Formula, a major effort to airlift infant formula that meets Americans health standards and safety standards,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúToday, I‚Äôm proud to say that because of this flight, high quality formula is already on the way to American shelves. We‚Äôve already conducted two flights with 1.5 million eight ounce bottles of Nestl√© and Gerber‚Äôs hypo allergenic formulas for children with severe allergies.‚Äù¬†¬†Biden also claimed he was not informed of the severe nature of the shortage until early April.‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal, I became aware of this problem sometime in early April,‚Äù the president voiced. ‚ÄúWe did everything in our power from that point on and that‚Äôs all I can tell you right now.‚ÄùDespite his remarks, critics point out that he didn‚Äôt address the crisis until May. The president met with baby formula manufacturers for a virtual meeting Wednesday. During the meeting they told him they warned the FDA and his administration of upcoming shortages earlier this year.His push to alleviate the crisis comes as the White House recently announced United Airlines will now ship 3.7 million eight ounce bottles of the Kendamil infant formula from the UK. This will be Operation Fly Formula‚Äôs third mission.I‚Äôve got an update on our efforts to bring more infant formula to the United States: We secured another 6.5 million bottles of safe infant formula from Nestl√©. That means as of today, 94.5 million bottles of safe infant formula are heading to U.S. shelves. pic.twitter.com/1s4A5CphpB‚Äî President Biden (@POTUS) June 2, 2022The¬†process will take three weeks to complete.","President Joe Biden listens as he meets virtually with infant formula manufacturers from the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Wednesday, June 1, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:15 AM PT ‚Äì Thursday, June 2, 2022The White House is, once again, justifying President Joe Biden‚Äôs statements after reports of US cyber attacks against Russia have emerged. According to administration officials, this offensive against Russia does not violate Biden‚Äôs policy of not directly engaging with the country.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre fielded questions Wednesday about recent reports that the US was engaged in hacking operations aimed at Russia.Reporter: Just speaking specifically about the offensive cyber action being taken from the United States against Russia. Is that not contrary to what the President has said in the past about not wanting to engage directly?)Jean-Pierre: No, it‚Äôs not. We don‚Äôt see it as such.Reporter: Can you talk about why offensive cyber activity against Russia is not?Jean-Pierre: I mean, it‚Äôs just, we just don‚Äôt see it as such. We have talked about this before. We‚Äôve had our cyber experts here at the podium layout what our plan is. That has not changed. So, the answer is just simply, no.‚ÄôThe White House‚Äôs response came after the head of US Cyber Command, General Paul Nakasone, confirmed to Sky News that the US conducted a series of offensive hacking operations in response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. The four-star general did not offer details, but said they were offensive, defensive and information operations.In a New York Times editorial Tuesday, Biden walked-back claims that he wanted to see Russian President Vladimir Putin removed from office despite previously saying he ‚Äúcould not remain in power.‚Äù Biden said the US does not seek a war between NATO and Russia. He also noted the US will not push for Putin‚Äôs ouster.The President said as long as the US or it‚Äôs allies are not attacked, America will not directly engage in the war. Despite his claim, however, Biden affirmed the US will continue military, humanitarian and financial support for the Ukraine government. Nonetheless, the President failed to mention anything about cyber attacks.","White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, June 1, 2022.
