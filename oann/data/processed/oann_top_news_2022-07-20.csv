3:00 PM PT",Devos: I personally think the Department of Education should not exist,"Former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said she personally believes the Department of Education should not exist. DeVos made the comment during the inaugural Moms for Liberty summit in Florida over the weekend.Moms for Liberty is a conservative nonprofit founded in Florida that advocates for parents to have more influence over public school decisions. The organization first received national attention when it fought against mask mandates in schools and later when it opposed curriculum related to LGBTQ rights, race and discrimination.“There are a lot of really nice and well-meaning people there,” DeVos voiced. “I don’t mean to disparage them in any way, but they are definitely oriented around being in their roles for probably most of their careers, if not all of them.”… says the guy who needlessly kept schools closed for nearly two years, because the union bosses made him.Putting parents in charge of education decisions wouldn't ""destroy"" public education. It would protect students from politicians like you. https://t.co/rkb2I8EHng— Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) July 18, 2022The former Trump administration official has previously said she had to work around most of the career staff at the agency in order to advance any creative reforms. During an event organized by the American Institute Enterprise last month, DeVos described dealing with an agency full of career bureaucrats.“Really for any of the creative reforms that we advanced we really had to essentially work around most of the career staff,” she said. “Because there were very few who would actually get the work done that needed to be done or would present options that weren’t even close to what we were attempting to do.”Former Secretary of Education @BetsyDeVos tells me she had a plan to ABOLISH the Department of Education and return the power to parents, but Congress wasn't interested: ""Bottom line, there was no action taken.

That led to the consideration of doing something a little bit more expressive and that was the determination on the ad.”In the ad that launched in early July, Newsom said “freedom is under attack in Florida.” He urged Floridians to flee the Sunshine State and instead join him in California where he promises “freedom.”We’re about to celebrate Independence Day — but Freedom is under attack by Republican leaders in states like Florida.Banning books.Restricting speech.Making it harder to vote.Criminalizing women and doctors. It’s time to stand up.

The third victim was a 30-year-old named Victor Gomez. The gunman was reportedly 20-years-old. He was stopped by a good Samaritan who has now been identified as 22-year-old Elisjsha Dicken who is cooperating fully with authorities. The gunman opened fire in the food court which sent shoppers running for their lives.“So we were in the food court and we heard loud gun shots,” said witness Heather Arthur.Chris Roy, assistant manager of the mall’s Van’s shoe store was working Sunday when he saw people running through the hallway away from the food court just before closing.“I jumped over the counter, locked the door, gathered my associates and other managers at the back door,” stated Roy.Through the back door they huddled in an interior hallway with about 40 or 50 other people, mostly customers from other stores, he claimed. That hallway didn’t have an exterior exit so they waited for police to come clear them.“We just instructed everybody to keep quiet,” he voiced.pic.twitter.com/r3eCthiHBD— Gregg Doyel (@GreggDoyelStar) July 17, 2022Two people were injured, including a 12-year-old girl. Both of the injured victims are hospitalized in stable condition. The shooter was shot and killed by Dicken. Authorities described him as “a good Samaritan with a handgun.” Dicken was able to neutralize the gunman within two minutes after the gunman had already fired 24 rounds from his rifle. Dicken fired 10 shots from his Glock handgun.“His actions were nothing short of heroic,” voiced Greenwood Police Chief Jason Ison. “He engaged the gunman from quite a distance with a handgun. He was very proficient in that, very tactically sound and as he moved to close in on the suspect he was also motioning for people to exit behind him. Many more people would have died last night if not for a responsible armed citizen that took action very quickly within the first two minutes of the shooting.”First responders assisted the injured and law enforcement worked to secure the scene. Greenwood Mayor Mark W. Myers also thanked the Dicken’s for his heroism. He also said the tragedy hits the core of the community and he encouraged residents to pray for the victims and first responders.Greenwood Mayor Mark Myers says 3 shot and 3 dead including the shooter.

Two single engine planes collided with each other Sunday afternoon, over the North Las Vegas Airport. Officials said one of the planes was preparing to land when the other hit it. Two people were aboard each plane and all four died in the incident.The airport is located just north of downtown Las Vegas and is mainly used by smaller aircraft. A local pilot said there has been concerns raised over the frequent traffic at the airport.“There’s a lot of traffic, so it’s always a concern about how well the airport system and flights are managed coming in and out of the airport,” said Dore Rodine, a pilot who has a plane hangared at North Las Vegas Airport.Incident Alert- at aprox 12pm today NLVFD and LVFR crews responded to a report of a mid air collision at the North Las Vegas airport.

(Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP, Pool, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:58 PM PT – Monday, July 18, 2022The penalty trial for the Parkland shooter is underway. A panel of 22 people, 12 jurors and 10 alternates were sworn in on Monday. The trial is expected to last months, but will ultimately determine the fate of the man who pleaded guilty to 17 counts of first degree murder in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Nikolas Cruz took the lives of 14 students, a teacher, a coach and an athletic director at the high school on Feb. 14, 2018.Opening statements reportedly took up the majority of Monday’s hearing. The defense let prosecutors have their say and have their way. Assistant Public Defender Melisa McNeill chose to reserve the team’s opening statement until the prosecution is finished presenting its case. Prosecutor Mike Satz called seven witnesses to the stand. The defense did not ask a single question of any of them.“We were sitting ducks,” said said Danielle Gilbert, who recorded the first series of cellphone videos shown to the jury. “There was no way to protect ourselves.” Gilbert was a junior at Stoneman Douglas at the time. The videos showed students and a teacher hiding in fear as about two dozen gunshots were fired nearby. Although her body is not seen until the final video clip, victim Carmen Schentrup was already dead just a few yards away from Gilbert.HORRIFIC!   You can hear the endless gunshots from #NikolasCruz and he's killing students.  Danielle Gilbert recorded him on her cellphone. The gallery can hear but not see the video.

Family members of his victims leaned on each other for support. Some couldn’t take it and left the room. Another could not wait five seconds into a video clip before declaring she’d had enough.“Shut it off!” called out a family member of a victim.Satz claimed that Cruz had planned to be a school shooter for a long time. He described a video that Cruz made three days before the killing where he bragged that he was going to be the “next school shooter” and that he hoped to kill at least 20.Prosecutors replayed the horrific day and detailed the shooter’s methodical plan. They said he was “cold, calculated and deadly.”","FILE – Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz is shown at the defense table during jury selection in the penalty phase of his trial at the Broward County Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Tuesday, June 28, 2022.

2:00 PM PT",Dr. Birx claims much of her Covid guidance was arbitrary,"Dr. Birx claims much of her Covid guidance was arbitraryOAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, July 18, 2022Dr. Deborah Birx. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Former White House COVID Response Coordinator Doctor Deborah Birx came clean about the guidance she gave to slow the spread. On Sunday, The Post Millennial reported on Birx’s testimony before Congress and her new book “Silent Invasion.”She admitted in both that the CDC data didn’t help her make clear public health recommendations. Birx’s plan that was two weeks long to slow the spread was apparently based on statistics from other countries not the US. The existing CDC data wasn’t of any use, Birx said. She picked apart the CDC’s approach and voiced that they should have been more forceful in their data collection and in going to states and demanding information.“I couldn’t do anything that would reveal my true intention,” she wrote. “To use the travel ban as one brick in the construction of a larger wall of protective measures we needed to enact very soon. Trump’s team was more concerned about the impacts and potential for loss of lives to Americans of shutting society down. She blasts the administration for their concerns over the economy, concerns which have played out in real time to the point where the country could be facing devastating impacts, as is the globe.Before posting my final review of D. Birx's book, I offer you one more excerpt on how she doctored the weekly Covid reports to the states coming from the White House. You won't believe this one. pic.twitter.com/saYjSzPhpc— Jeffrey A Tucker (@jeffreyatucker) July 16, 2022Birx urged solutions to the problem of data collection. She said that “there remains a lack of emphasis on active testing and there is still no sense of urgency to find the silent community invasion that occurs days to weeks before symptoms.” Birx lamented that looking back they were not more stern in their approach to guidance. She explained that it is concerning that people would not “prioritize the health of others over their own personal liberty” and noted that early data from Europe showed widespread compliance.“I don’t know,” she admitted. “All I know is there was evidence from the global pandemic that natural reinfection was occurring. Since the vaccine was based on natural immunity you cannot make the conclusion that the vaccine will do better than natural infection, although it can often do slightly better.”She said the US had a “silent spread” and there was no way to track it. The doctor claimed this is what led to continuing lockdowns for over a year.",Dr. Deborah Birx.

(CDC via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:00 PM PT – Monday, July 18, 2022Officials at all levels of government are growing more worried about the spread of Monkeypox. Democrat lawmakers, Big Pharma and the World Health Organization are coming together to sound the alarm on the viral disease. Taking to the corporate airwaves Sunday, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monkeypox cases are increasing in the capital and the city needs at least 100,000 vaccine doses to respond to the current surge which can cause a potential spike in the future.LIVE: Mayor Bowser Provides Update on Monkeypox Outbreak and Response Efforts https://t.co/1PVKf2vUz0— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) July 18, 2022This comes as Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine recently took to Twitter and urged the federal government to send the Big Apple more vaccines. He revealed that New York City has 30 percent of all Monkeypox cases in the US, while having a disproportionately low number of the government’s vaccine supply. For her part, Mayor Bowser claimed that cities with robust testing resources will see more cases confirmed.“We need more doses and we know that work is being done,” said Bowser. “We already have a very robust testing regime and we’ve modeled it on what we’re able to do with COVID. We’re going to continue to test and I think because of that robust testing we’re going to see more cases.”The window for containing the spread of monkeypox in NYC is closing fast. Cases have more than doubled in the past week.In a bad case of deja vu we are again confronting shortages of testing, treatment & vaccine.Here’s our plan for aggressive action to meet this challenge. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/afZ1DKzIFL— Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) July 18, 2022However, former FDA chief under President Trump and coincidentally now a Pfizer executive Scott Gottlieb has a more dire assessment of the latest virus. Gottlieb warned that the Biden administration has failed to contain Monkeypox and would categorize the virus’s spread as a pandemic. He further lamented that the Biden administration will likely be reluctant to own up to its mistakes and it’s downplaying the spread.“I think they’re going to be reluctant to use the word pandemic because it complies that they’ve failed to contain this,” Gottlieb stated. “I think at this point we’ve failed to contain this. We’re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus where this now becomes something that is persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think that the window for getting control of this and containing this probably has closed and if it hasn’t closed it’s certainly starting to close. 11,000 cases across the world right now. 1,800 cases in the US and we’re probably just detecting a fraction of the actual cases.”The pharma executive went on to say that there is only one FDA approved vaccine for Monkeypox and the federal government has to now go through the complicated inspection, approval and distribution processes at the same time. Gottlieb did commend the Biden administration for taking responsibility for the response from the CDC, but he argued that the White House should not have to take control of medical emergencies when there are institutions designed to handle those. He added that this is exactly what happened with the Covid-19 pandemic when President Trump was forced to take action amid a timid response by the medical establishment.“The white house has intervened to take more control of the response away from CDC,” the doctor voiced. “This can’t be our response every time that the CDC drops the ball. The White House and political leadership needs to step in. That’s what happened here. It happened in COVID.”Since May, DC has reported 122 #Monkeypox cases. In response, we've:✅Administered 2600+ vaccines & continue to book appointments for eligible residents✅Used contact tracing to identify 450+ close contacts✅Acquired TPOXX, an antiviral treatment for use by healthcare partners— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) July 18, 2022Meanwhile, the WHO is debating whether to call the Monkeypox spread a global health emergency. The body recently updated the public on the nearly 10,000 cases confirmed over the past few months. It also recently reported Monkeypox cases tripled across Europe which made health officials in neighboring regions concerned about a potential massive surge. WHO officials worried that the number of confirmed cases may not account for the real number of cases.“Testing remains a challenge and it’s highly probable that there are a significant number of cases not being picked up,” expressed WHO officials. “Europe is the current epicenter of the outbreak, recording more than 80 percent of cases globally.”In the meantime, a WHO emergency committee is expected to meet on Thursday to assess the threat of Monkeypox. Additionally, doctor Gottlieb claimed there won’t be an explosion of cases that come in the future. He pointed to the slow progression from contraction to showing symptoms.Gottlieb also said lawmakers in Washington D.C. desperately need to reform its emergency response tactics. He said if those protocols remain the same then the US will be behind whenever a new pandemic hits US shores.","This 1997 image provided by the CDC during an investigation into an outbreak of monkeypox, which took place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formerly Zaire, and depicts the dorsal surfaces of the hands of a monkeypox case patient, who was displaying the appearance of the characteristic rash during its recuperative stage.

That’s according to a new poll released Sunday that surveyed over 1,000 registered voters. According to the data, 44 percent would vote for a generic GOP candidate compared to 41 percent who would back a Democrat.Forty-one percent of participants were Democrats, 41 percent were Republican and 19 percent were independent. Some analysts predict Republicans have a strong chance to take the majority of the body due to Democrats focusing on cultural and social issues, instead of economic issues.Meanwhile, Sen.

However, Kirby claimed Biden’s Middle East tour was integral in advancing his agenda and asserted it will yield some positive results.“They (the meetings) produced results and they will probably produce results in the future that are in the best interest of the American people,” he stated. “The President went on this trip because it was in the national interest that he do it.”The White House aid went on to say Biden and the Crown Prince came together on several issues, including efforts to denuclearize Iran.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:39 AM PT – Tuesday, July 19, 2022President Joe Biden’s economy czar, Jared Bernstein, appeared to admit inflation wasn’t transitory, while still asking the country to trust its policies moving forward. On Monday, Bernstein held a press conference to showcase the 34th day of declining fuel costs. He touted the price of gas has dropped 50 cents per gallon since its June peak and reassured the public the trend should continue so long as circumstances remain favorable.“We think it’s reasonable to expect more gas stations to lower their prices in response to lower input costs and thus, barring unforeseen market disruptions to see average prices fall below $4 per gallon in more places in coming weeks,” stated the economic adviser.However, the press raised concerns about Bernstein’s forecast as officials have promised inflation was transitory, only for rates to continue hovering at 40-year highs. The adviser downplayed such worries, trumpeting a number of factors to bolster his claim that the Biden economy is robust.“So I think if you look at the strength of the current economy, if you look at the strength of the labor market, if you look at the strength of consumer spending, you would conclude that where we are right now remains solidly within expansion,” he claimed. “I think we can confidently say that these numbers that we’re posting are very much inconsistent with a recessionary call given where we are right now.”However, members of the press refused to relent pointing to Biden’s refusal to take credit for any of the economic woes that have taken place during his presidency. Bernstein shot back by disagreeing with their assessment and praising Biden’s policies.“I think what’s happening here is a President who is working tirelessly to address the largest constraint, probably the toughest constraint facing American households right now: the the budgetary impacts of these elevated prices,” stated the economy czar. “And we’re showing you here today some real results.”﻿The price of gasoline remains more than $2 higher per gallon than when Biden first took office. Although the President has often blamed Russia for the pain at the pump, prices had already risen a dollar per gallon prior to the invasion of Ukraine.A March study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank found found half of the inflation rate in quarter four of last year had been triggered by bloated pandemic spending packages. Nonetheless, the Biden administration seems to be telling Americans to be grateful for a slight decline in gas prices as the population continues to feel pain in their pockets.","Council of Economic Advisers member Jared Bernstein speaks at a press briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, July 18, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:21 PM PT – Tuesday, July 19, 2022National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director and Chief White House Medical Advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci said he’s not going anywhere. While speaking at an event hosted by The Hill Tuesday, Fauci dismissed a recent Politico report claiming he was going to retire by the end of President Joe Biden’s term.However, Dr. Fauci said he does not see himself staying in his current position, regardless of who is occupying the White House next. He also said he can still contribute to medical research at the federal level. His comments come as the nation’s highest paid unelected bureaucrat  has come under immense scrutiny over the past few years for his positions on vaccine and mask mandates as well as funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab in China.Dr. Fauci is currently 81-years-old and has been working for the federal government for over 50 years. He has been at the NIAID since 1984 and has spent the majority of his career studying HIV, Ebola and other highly infections diseases. In 2020, Fauci became the face of the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where he advocated universal masking, economic lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations.Meanwhile, government watchdog Judicial Watch is taking legal action against the Biden administration while seeking the records of NIH official Christine Grady, who is the wife of Dr. Fauci. In the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, Judicial Watch requests a court order the Department of Health and Human Services to produce Grady’s financial disclosure documents and other information.BREAKING: Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit on behalf of American Transparency (https://t.co/h4AxlvT1ZF) against HHS for employment and financial disclosure records for the NIH chief of the Clinical Center’s Department of Bioethics,Christine Grady.

The Manhattan district attorney filed a motion to dismiss the charges against 61-year-old Jose Alba Tuesday.This came after a reported probe determined they could not prove Alba was not justified in using deadly force. Alba contends he acted in self-defense when he killed 34-year Simon Austin, who camera footage shows attacked him behind the counter of the Blue Moon bodega on July 1.61-year-old bodega worker Jose Alba was attacked by an enraged career criminal, Austin Simon, who went behind the counter and choked him over a bag of chips. Alba defended himself, and Simon died. DA Alvin Bragg has charged him with murder. pic.twitter.com/FIfL1O1q7X— Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) July 7, 2022The case drew widespread scrutiny with Mayor Eric Adams among several of Albas notable supporters. Adams said he cannot dictate or mandate how the Manhattan district attorney prosecutes crimes. However, the Mayor did add that his heart goes out to the hard-working and honest Alba.“I am hoping that we take all of that into consideration as this hard-working New Yorker was doing his job and someone aggressively went behind the counter to attack him,” Adams stated. “I support hard-working, innocent people that are doing their job.”The United Bodegas of America and Yemeni American Merchants Association has been lobbying for Albas’ charges to be dropped, while explaining his act of self-defense was justified.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Pres.
