(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Thursday, July 7, 2022A Republican gubernatorial hopeful in Michigan plead not guilty to several charges related to the January 6 capitol protest.Ryan Kelley entered the plea on Thursday to four misdemeanor charges which include entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds. This comes after the FBI raided his home last month and arrested him. He has since been released.“The FBI did raid my house in front of my wife, in front of my children, put on this big theater show for misdemeanor charges,” said Kelley. “It was the same day that they started their January 6 witch hunt committee.”A criminal complaint filed by the FBI alleged that Kelley climbed onto an “architectural feature” of the Capitol and waved other rioters to continue forward. The FBI also said Kelley supported a rioter who pulled a metal barricade onto scaffolding and that he took photos of blood on Capitol grounds. Court documents dated June 22 said he is accused of destroying a tarp covering scaffolding on the Capitol. The damage was valued at less than $1,000. Authorities do not allege that Kelley entered the building.In the Republican gubernatorial debate on Wednesday, Kelley said he was in Washington during the riot but he argued his actions were protected by the First Amendment.His campaign claimed the charges are political persecution against him brought on by Democrat leaders in the state, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D-Mich.).Michigan GOP gubernatorial hopeful Ryan Kelley returns to court (virtually) in his Capitol breach case on September 22nd.

In this day and age, our priority should be to protect.”Hoffman voiced that he is concerned about preventing school shootings. He said most elementary schools do not have their own SRO in Indiana.“The disturbing fact is that they’re happening in elementary schools and we can’t turn a blind eye to it,” Hoffman voiced. “If you don’t have school security it should be number one on your list.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:08 PM PT – Wednesday, July 6, 2022A trigger law on abortion has cleared its final hurdle in Mississippi. The Jackson Women’s Health Organization in lost yet another legal challenge to the state’s coming restrictions on abortion. On Tuesday, a judge struck down the abortion clinic’s attempt to temporarily block the law that would ban most abortions.The court did give the clinic a chance to argue its case after it lost a landmark case in the Supreme Court that resulted in the ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade. The clinic lamented Mississippi’s move to ban abortions before six-months would harm women in the state.“Fordice specifically noted that at the time the Mississippi Constitution was adopted, abortion was legal until quickening some four to five months in pregnancy,” said Rob McDuff, attorney for the Jackson Women’s Health Organization. “So the status quo that we see and that we ask you to maintain is the status quo that has existed in the state of Mississippi, except for a very small period of time. And that status quo is required to prevent the irreparable harm that would come from the enforcement of an unconstitutional law.”Officials in the Magnolia State stressed the law was passed in 2007 and it was supported by members of both parties. Under the law, abortions would be illegal except in case of rape or incest, along with cases when giving birth would endanger the mother.Providers who perform the procedure outside those specified circumstances could face up to 10-years in prison if they are caught. However, Jackson Women’s Health Organization decried the law while claiming the state is wielding its power to force residents to have babies against their will.“But more importantly, the patients of the clinic, the women of Mississippi who do seek an abortion, who do make the decision that under the law only they can make, not the state, about whether they should carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, they will be forced to do those things against their will, many of them,” McDuff continued.In the meantime, the law is expected to go into effect Thursday. Other southern states are trying to set their abortion restrictions in place with Florida’s 15-week-ban being blocked Tuesday and quickly reinstated. Additionally, Louisiana’s attorney general is trying to dissolve a block on the state’s abortion ban, which is currently being challenged in state courts. These states and others have vowed to establish strong laws that protect the sanctity of life.","Attorney Rob McDuff, left, an attorney representing the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, argues on behalf of the state’s only abortion clinic, for a lawsuit filed by them to remain open by blocking a law that would ban most abortions in the state, before Special Chancellor Debbra K.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:47 AM PT – Wednesday, July 6, 2022The judge in the Illinois parade shooting case ordered the suspected gunman be held without bond as he faces seven first-degree murder charges. Robert Crimo III, 21, appeared in court Wednesday and officials said he admitted to his crimes, but they did not want to speculate on motives. He was charged with seven-counts of first degree murder.Police said the gunman opened fire from the rooftop of a high rise building just as the Fourth of July parade kicked off Monday morning in downtown Highland Park, which is located north of Chicago. While dozens of people were injured in the violent attack, six out of the seven victims have now been identified.“On a day that we came together to celebrate community and freedom we are instead mourning a tragic loss of life and struggling with the terror that was brought upon us,” voiced Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering.Authorities said the suspect intended to go to Madison, Wisconsin to commit another mass shooting. He reportedly bought four weapons in 2020 and purchased a Glock in 2021 after his 21st birthday. They believe Crimo pre-planned the attack on the parade and he was preparing for it for several weeks.The suspect was also said to be dressed in women’s clothing and investigators believe he did this to hide his identity and aid in his escape. He reportedly borrowed his mother’s vehicle. An alert was issued by authorities on the vehicle and Crimo’s information. The vehicle was later spotted and reported.“He brought a high-powered rifle to this parade, he accessed the roof of a business via a fire escape ladder and began opening fire on the innocent Independence Day celebration goers,” said Chris Covelli, spokesperson for the Major Crime Task Force at the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.A second rifle was located inside the vehicle with indications Crimo purchased this rifle as well. However, reports say he had legally purchased five weapons, including a shotgun and a pistol, prior to the attack. Additionally, authorities said Crimo purchased the rifle legally, despite having been involved in at least two police incidents in the past. He had a previous background of attempted suicide and threats of violence in 2019.In a video feed from the Lake County, Ill., jail Robert E.

On Friday, a state judge said she cannot extend a restraining order on the state’s so-called “trigger law” imposed by a judge in New Orleans after Roe was overturned.The court has denied the request to extend the temporary restraining order in New Orleans. Abortion is again banned in Louisiana.— Emily Woodruff (@emily_woodruff_) July 8, 2022The decision came the same day President Joe Biden issued an executive order to protect access to abortion in states where it is still legal and mitigate the potential penalties women seeking the procedure may face after the high court’s ruling on June 24.Abortion rights advocates in numerous states have filed court challenges to laws restricting the procedure. In Mississippi, home of the case that led to the Supreme Court decision, attorneys for the state’s sole abortion clinic filed a petition on Thursday asking the state’s highest court to temporarily block a new law that bans most abortions. The attorneys made the request on the day the law took effect and two days after a Mississippi judge rejected the same request.Legal experts said this gives the state a green light to enforce its near-total abortion ban. However, Louisiana’s Attorney General Jeff Landry lamented that judges are punting the decision to other districts.“If they continue to operate, they do so under their own risk,” Landry said.Speaking after the court hearing today, @AGJeffLandry tells people who disagree with Louisiana’s abortion ban that they can move to another state pic.twitter.com/UFbdc3q3qG— Sam Karlin (@samkarlin) July 8, 2022Landry went on to vow that he will fight legal challenges to the state’s abortion ban in any court he’s sent to.

Greg Abbott (R) signed an executive order addressing the “invasion” over illegal immigrants. Abbott authorized the state’s National Guard and Department of Public Safety to apprehend illegal migrants who cross the southern border.The executive order issued on Thursday also empowers the National Guard and DHS to return illegal aliens from across the US to the southern border. Abbot said Texas is taking “unprecedented action” because of Biden’s failing border policies, which has emboldened human smugglers and cartels. This comes after multiple counties in Texas declared the migrant crisis an invasion. They called on the Governor to take action.Abbott has taken significant action to secure the border in the wake of the federal government’s inaction. Some of those actions include securing $4 billion in funding for Texas border security efforts, launching Operation Lone Star and deploying thousands of National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, arresting and jailing illegal migrants trespassing or committing other state crimes in Texas and allocating resources that include acquiring 1,700 unused steel panels to build the border wall in Texas.“While the Biden Administration has abandoned border communities, the state of Texas will support them and help them respond to the disaster that President Biden has caused on the border,” said Abbott. “Operation Lone Star grant funding has played an integral role in our mission to keep Texans safe and support local communities. I encourage local governments to apply for these funds as we work together to prevent illegal immigration and the smuggling of people, illegal weapons and deadly drugs like fentanyl from Mexico into Texas.” I issued an Executive Order authorizing the Texas National Guard & Texas Dept. of Public Safety to return illegal immigrants to the border.Cartels have become emboldened by Biden's open border policies.Texas is taking unprecedented action to STOP this criminal enterprise. pic.twitter.com/ag08ACYP3Y— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) July 7, 2022In a separate announcement Abbott revealed Texas is allocating an additional $30 million to Operation Lone Star to help cities and counties boost border security.","FILE – In this March 16, 2020, file photo, Texas Gov.
