In a recent letter to FBI Director Chris Wray, the Ohio Congressman demanded an explanation of the bureau targeting it’s own employees.“Since our May 6 letter, we have received new protected whistleblower disclosures that suggest the FBI’s actions are far more pervasive than previously known,” Jordan alleged.🚨 LATE BREAKING: New whistleblowers allege the FBI is “purging” conservatives at the Bureau.

Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) June 8, 2022He stated a number of concerned FBI agents have come forward as higher-ranking FBI officials questioned their allegiance to the US over their political views. This after Jordan revealed, some FBI agents are facing suspension and termination for participating in January 6 protests.“We are conducting oversight to ensure the FBI is not retaliating against FBI employees for exercising their First Amendment rights,” he wrote. “We ask for your personal assurance that the FBI will cooperate fully with the Inspector General’s examination.”Jordan also said a separate “whistleblower” who has since left the FBI, told him about retaliation they received for criticizing the FBI in an anonymous survey taken of employees following January 6, 2021.The Ohio Congressman feels political purges have no place in the US government.","Rep.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:45 AM PT – Wednesday, June 8, 2022The House Rules Committee debated on two pieces of gun control laws. In a Tuesday hearing, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) presented the Protect Our Kids and the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Acts.The Protect Our Kids and the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act is an omnibus package which raises the purchasing age for semiautomatic rifles, prohibits the possession of high capacity magazines, establishes requirements regulating the storage of firearms in residences and creates a registry for bump stock owners. Additionally, this measure would allow a family member or law enforcement official to petition a federal court to prohibit an individual they believe to be a risk to themselves from purchasing a firearm or ammunition.“The measures before us offer sensible solutions that a clear, convincing, in fact overwhelming majority of voters agree with,” McGovern stated. “As a country, our leaders, including all of us here in this room, are responsible for making choices. If we do nothing, we are making a choice. We are choosing to be powerless. We are choosing to do nothing to stop the next mass shooting from happening on our watch.”McGovern also claimed that a majority of gun owners supported these two bills in the aftermath of the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde.“Most gun owners, I think, favor the stuff that we’re talking about here today,” he noted. “But the extremists in the gun lobby, you know what? They’ll have the last word and more children will die. And I hope maybe this is the moment that there are enough people in a bipartisan way here that will come together and actually do something.”In response to his arguments, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) argued they violated the Second Amendment and Congress should be looking into approaching the issue of mass shootings from a public health perspective.“Our nation is in the midst of a widespread mental health crisis,” Cole explained. “The growing number and frequency of mass shootings are a reminder that our country must take a comprehensive public health approach to gun violence that addresses culture, mental illness, gun safety and regulations that also respect the Second Amendment. But unfortunately, the measures before us today do not meet that test.”Gun control laws only disarm law-abiding citizens because criminals don’t follow the law.— Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) June 8, 2022Meanwhile, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) pointed out a major flaw in the Democrats push to implement gun reform legislation.“The gun bills that are presented here today all suffer a common flaw that almost all gun control suffers from, and that is criminals don’t obey the law,” he stated. “Good guys obey the law. They’ll disarm in a gun free zone and then that’s, those are the types of places that the criminals seek out. The chairman said that these bills are not an attempt to take away people’s guns, but in reality these bills will take all guns from some people and some guns from all people. And predominantly it will limit law abiding citizens access to guns.”In the meantime, both bills are expected to hit the House floor this week.","House Rules Committee Ranking Member Tom Cole, R-Okla., left, and Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., confer as the panel prepares to advance a Democratic gun control bill to the floor, the Protecting Our Kids Act, in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and New York, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:37 AM PT – Wednesday, June 8, 2022President Joe Biden signed nine bills into law helping veterans. However, some are still criticizing him for past grievances. This comes as both sides of the aisle are in agreement when it comes to helping veterans.Biden signed the legislation into law Tuesday to honor and improve care for veterans. some of the bills seek to provide better access to mammograms for veterans exposed to burn pits, improve breast imaging services. . and to compensate veterans who have developed cancer or medical conditions from World War II-era nuclear programs. Additionally, the President said they are focused on veterans future.“We’re going to strengthen the oversight of the VA’s activities so veterans get the care they deserve,” Biden stated. “And restoring educational systems benefits so veterans displaced by COVID-19 can continue to gain new skills to meet the demands and change in the workforce.”However, Army combat veteran and Florida congressional candidate Cory Mills slammed the administration on Tuesday for failing to show respect for veterans in the past.“This is the same guy who wouldn’t even recognize the 13 fallen who died in Afghanistan and perished during his State of the Union address,” said Mills. “He has missed multiple engagements to actually try and show sympathy or show honor, show respect for our fallen heroes and he’s failed to do so.”Biden was also criticized for acknowledging D-Day late.“We had 150,000 brave Americans who actually landed on the shores to try and take back and fight against the axis of evil,” said Mills. “That 150,000 was considered to be an invasion? We have just in the last couple of months, over 150,000 who have crossed our borders, but the Biden administration still refuses to call that an invasion. The Biden administration is failing us in every single way and what a gaffe to not actually recognize the greatest generation of our lifetimes.”78 years ago we sent 150,000 of our bravest on D-Day for the launch of the “invasion” to defeat evil. Today the Dems do not think the 2,000,000 that has crossed this year, the 150,000 in coming months, and the 11.3M already residing inside the US illegally is an invasion.— Cory Mills 🍊 (@CoryMillsFL) June 6, 2022","President Joe Biden arrives to speak and sign into law nine bipartisan bills that will honor and improve care for America’s veterans during an event in the State Dining room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.

A recent clinical trial consisting of 14 rectal cancer patients found they were in complete remission with zero side effects after taking Dostarlimab.In fact, these positive results all occurred without the use of chemotherapy. While the trial was done on rectal cancer patients, researchers believe it could be a potential treatment for many forms of cancer.“When we give immunotherapy, it really just revs up the immune system so that it sees the cancer and gets rid of it, but what’s so remarkable here is that it completely eliminated the cancer,” explained Dr. Andrea Cercek, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “The tumors just vanished in all 14 consecutive patients. Normally when this was used in rectal cancer in patients with advanced disease, that happens in about 10 percent of patients and here it’s 100 percent.”Researchers described the results as unprecedented and have said they will have to repeat the trial in a larger capacity before they label the drug as a potential cure.","In this photo a health care is pictured in Orange, Calif.

They also cited an up-tick in shoplifting, burglaries and open-air drug dealing as reasons to recall him. Despite this, Boudin blamed his loss on being outspent three-to-one.“Voters were not asked to choose between criminal justice reform and something else,” he stated. “They were given an opportunity to voice their frustration and their outrage, and they took that opportunity.”Boudin is the first San Francisco district attorney to be recalled in the city’s history.

This committee is unconstitutional, it is illegitimate. It was not put together according to the rules of the House. It does not serve any true legislative or oversight purpose and it is not about finding out why Nancy Pelosi left the Capitol so ill prepared that day.”‘""While Democrats obsess over this illegitimate hearing, House Republicans will be setting the record straight and telling the truth about lame-duck Speaker Pelosi’s sham political witch-hunt."" – @RepStefanik pic.twitter.com/gOmP9fvOiE— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) June 8, 2022House Minority Whip Steve Scalise called out Pelosi for continuing to politicize January 6 while ignoring the several crisis Americans are facing, including high gas prices, high inflation and the southern border crisis.“Fentanyl…you wanna talk about deaths among young kids, thousands of young kids have died from fentanyl that’s come across our southern border last year alone,” said Scalise. “Over 100,000 American last year died from the opioids that are coming across our open southern border. We can do something about that today and unfortunately there’s no legislation that Speaker Pelsoi will bring to secure our southern border. There’s no primetime hearing to talk about what needs to be done to keep Americans safe.”WATCH @SteveScalise on Pelosi’s political witch-hunt:“The idea that Nancy Pelosi continues to politicize January 6th while ignoring things like high gas prices, inflation that’s out of control, a border crisis.” pic.twitter.com/6eEXyYXDaz— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) June 8, 2022Congressman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asserted the January 6 panel is aiming to prevent former President Donald Trump from running for the White House.Additionally, Rep.

(Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:17 PM PT – Thursday, June 9, 2022The leader of the La Luz Del Mundo Church was sentenced to more than 16 years in prison for the sexual abuse of teens. Naasón Joaquín García was sentenced in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday, after he pleaded guilty to three felonies just days before his long-awaited trial.Garcia plead guilty to two counts of forcible oral copulation involving minors and one count of a lewd act on a 15-year-old child. He was scheduled to go on trial Monday. He faced 23 felony counts that included allegations of human trafficking to produce child pornography and rape, but he accepted a last minute plea deal from the California Attorney General’s office.When he took the plea deal, some of his victims who wanted to testify against him became enraged. They were promised that no plea deal would be offered. In return for the guilty plea, the DA dropped the most serious allegations of five victims from 2015 to 2018.“As for the Jane Doe, at this point I apologize,” said Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. “My hands are tied. Lawyers do what lawyers do.”La Luz Del Mundo is the largest evangelical church in Mexico and has branches in more than 50 countries. To his more than five million followers worldwide, Garcia had been considered an “apostle” of Jesus Christ. To his victims, he was Satan incarnated.“I never consented to having sex with you,” voiced victim, Jane Doe. “I would never have said yes to you.”Another leader in the church, Alondra Campo, was charged with recruiting teenage girls to dance for Garcia in provocative outfits. If the girls refused, Garcia reportedly told them they were going against God. He claimed an apostle of god like him would never be judged for his actions.“He said it was a blessing to be with him,” cried out Jane Doe. “As he raped me, he would command me to seal my lips to preserve the blessing he was granting me and I did.”Prosecutors said the victims were essentially brainwashed by Garcia and were made to feel ostracized by their church community if they didn’t submit to his desires.“As to those family member who abandoned the Jane Doe’s, shame, shame on you,” stated Coen.","Naasón Joaquín García, the former leader of the fundamentalist Guadalajara, Mexico-based church La Luz del Mundo, sits during his sentencing in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday, June 8, 2022.

According to authorities, 26-year-old Nicholas Roske was taken into custody early Wednesday morning while armed with a gun, knife, pepper spray and burglary tools.Roske told detectives he was upset about the leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade as well as the recent wave of violence across the country and was there to kill Kavanaugh. Back in his community of Simi Valley, California, the local police executed a search warrant on his home to find anything that could be linked to his arrest. Officers said they did not have any previous run-ins with Roske aside from a traffic stop.If convicted, Roske could face up to 20-years in a federal prison.Meanwhile, the House of Representatives is considering legislation to provide security to immediate family members of Supreme Court justices. The Senate passed the Supreme Court Police Parity Act back in early May amid threats against justices over the leaked draft opinion concerning Roe v. Wade.On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) took to the floor of the upper chamber to call for the House to take action after Roske was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home.“This is exactly, exactly the kind of event that many feared that the terrible breach of the court’s rules and norms could fuel,” stated the Kentucky Republican. “This is exactly the kind of event that many worried the unhinged, reckless, apocalyptic rhetoric from prominent figures toward the court going back many months, and especially in recent weeks, could make more likely.”House Democrats may reportedly add a provision to the bill to provide protection to clerks and other staff. Reports have suggested House lawmakers will move to pass the bill in the near future.","Erin Schaff/Pool via APMembers of the Supreme Court pose for a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., April 23, 2021.",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scotus-family-2021-ap-ps-210423_1619202370233_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg, Dozens Of Women File Tort Claims Against FBI Seeking MoreTOPICS:abortionBrett KavanaughCaliforniacourtcrimedemocratgun controlHouse DemocratsJustice Brett KavanaughlawMitch McConnellnewsNicholas RoskeOANOANNpoliticsRepublicanRoe v.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:32 AM PT – Thursday, June 9, 2022House Republicans responded to new gun control laws proposed by Democrats. GOP representatives hosted a press conference regarding legislation being proposed in Congress.On Wednesday, congresswoman Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said proposed new bills would not end mass shootings. She pointed to places like New York and Chicago that have rampant gun violence despite implementing strict gun control measures.One proposal seeks to adopt red flag laws on the federal level, while an omnibus package contains measures such as codifying a ban on bump stocks and banning high capacity magazines.“What we shouldn’t do is accept the Democrats jamming radical left wing legislation through Congress at the expense of the American people’s liberty and freedom,” Boebert staed. “It would not end school shootings, but it certainly would disarm law abiding citizens. And if the leftist policies and these gun grabbing bills worked then New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, these cities would be safer than Mayberry, but they’re not.”Additionally, Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) accused Democrats of not wanting to address mental health issues that could reduce gun violence.“They’re doing it because they don’t want to focus on the root of the problem,” asserted the Louisiana lawmaker. “We’ve offered time and time again legislation to get to the root of the problem. Why are young kids committing more violent acts? Why shouldn’t we be asking that question? Why shouldn’t we be working on solving that problem as opposed to the Democrats approach of just taking away more guns?”Boebert ended the press conference by reminding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) about her husband who was recently arrested for driving under the influence.“Maybe you all should do your job and remind Speaker Pelosi how dangerous DUIs are and how many lives are lost at the hands of drunk drivers, rather than pushing forward eight unconstitutional gun legislation this week in Congress,” said the Colorado congresswoman.Paul Pelosi's DUI charges have been dropped.Is anyone really surprised?— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) June 8, 2022Later on Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted 228-to-199 in favor of the Protect Our Kids bill that would raise minimum age to purchase certain weapons from 18 to 21. The House has yet to vote on the Federal Risk Protection Order, which is expected to happen later this week.","Republican members of the House Second Amendment Caucus, from left, Rep.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:39 AM PT – Thursday, June 9, 2022The Biden administration has attempted to solve economic and migration woes with the country’s neighbors. President Joe Biden promoted his economic policies to the Western Hemisphere as inflation has continued to cripple America’s middle class. While speaking at the Summit of the America’s in Los Angeles Wednesday, he took a swipe at the tax cuts of the Trump administration.“What’s true in the United States is true in every country,” Biden said. “Trickle-down economics does not work. When we invest in strengthening workers and the middle class, the poor have a ladder up and those at the top do just fine. That’s how we can increase opportunity and decrease the persistent inequity.”I’m on my way to Los Angeles to host the Ninth Summit of the Americas. I look forward to working with leaders from across the Western Hemisphere to strengthen our bonds and to address our core challenges — from economic prosperity and climate change to migration and COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/bDndE5gwDo— President Biden (@POTUS) June 8, 2022Since the beginning of the year, the Biden economy has not seen year-on-year inflation rates dip below 7 percent. Despite his calls to address inequity, a recent report from Bank of America found such inflation disproportionately affected people of color and rural communities.In the face of such numbers, the President vowed to increase supply chains and trade throughout the America’s. He also addressed the northward migration taking place in the hemisphere. The Democrat teased a cooperative migration plan with the summit’s participants as his administration tries to scrap the Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy and Title 42.“We’ll also come together to launch the Los Angeles declaration,” he declared. “A ground breaking integrated new approach to managing migration and sharing responsibility across the hemisphere. The declaration represents a mutual commitment to invest in regional solutions that enhance stability, increase opportunities for safe and orderly migration through the region.”Biden’s remarks on immigration arose from a caravan of up to 15,000 people who are currently sneaking their way through Mexico towards the southern border. Leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras were not present despite being the source of 90 percent of America’s migration flow.Brazil and Argentina’s heads of state threatened to skip the conference until they were granted bilateral meetings with US officials. While trying to put on a brave face to America’s neighbors, Biden lamented to reporters about his negative press coverage regarding the economy and foreign policy aboard Air Force One.","President Joe Biden speaks during the opening ceremony at the Summit of the Americas Wednesday, June 8, 2022, in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:45 AM PT – Wednesday, June 8, 2022Vice President Kamala Harris announced funds to address what the Biden administration considers to be key causes of migration. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden’s border czar declared the inception of the Central American Service Corps, which is intended to target supposedly root causes of migration such as poverty, violence and climate change. The Vice President claimed the package will give individuals incentives to remain in their countries of origin.“This investment is on track to generate, as a result of what we have done so far,” said Harris. “Tens of thousands of jobs, as well as investments in sectors such as agriculture and textiles. This investment also means that more than 10 million people will have access to banking systems and credit.”The spending plan funds multiple private industries to expand operations in Central America, including $250 million for Visa to increase digital payment systems, $100 million for auto-part supplier Yazaki to hire more employees and a $700 million expansion of mobile networks in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The measure is also intended to promote youth programs, civil engagement activities and so-called green jobs.According to Harris, the funds will be an investment in making many Central American countries more attractive to reside in.“Consider that El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have a total population size of about 30 million people,” the vice president voiced. “A $3.2 billion investment will then have a direct impact on the quality of life for people throughout that region.”I'm proud of the work we're doing to address the root causes of migration from Central America. To date, we’ve secured more than $3.2 billion in investments from the private sector to create jobs and economic opportunity for those in the region.https://t.co/fG2fn0r5lP— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) June 7, 2022Although the funds are heading to Central America, they will not reach the migrant caravan currently making its way through Mexico. The caravan of up to 15,000 people is more than three-miles long and is marching towards the US border in anticipation of Title 42’s expiration.Since taking the role as border czar in March of last year, Harris has only visited the region twice.","Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a roundtable discussion with business executives during the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.
