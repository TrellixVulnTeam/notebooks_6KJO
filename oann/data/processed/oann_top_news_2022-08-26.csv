2022-08-25,8:09 AM PT,"Biden claims had no advance knowledge of Trump raid, Republicans argue either DOJ went rogue or Biden knew about its actions","President Joe Biden has continued to insist he did not know about the FBI raid of Donald Trump’s home until after it happened. While speaking to reporters Wednesday, Biden said he had no advance notice about the raid, echoing prior remarks by White House officials.However, Republicans believe the unprecedented raid must have been approved at the highest level and Biden must have at least known about it. They argue if it wasn’t then it means the Department of Justice has gone rogue. Meanwhile, members of the GOP say if the raid was approved by Biden then it is, indeed, a politically-motivated attack.“Is (Merrick) Garland a rogue AG who goes out there raiding presidential homes without approval from the White House?” asked Tom Fitton, President of government oversight group Judicial Watch. “He should be fired if that’s the case.

MAJORITY of “relief” would go to top 13% of Americans who enjoy GRADUATE degrees.President Biden announced Wednesday from the White House his plan to cancel $10,000 in student loans per student making less than $125,000 per year. The plan would also extend the student loan repayment pause by 4 months – to December 2022.Biden framed his plan as one that would benefit lower income and middle income Americans. He stated:“Nearly 45% [of federal student loan borrowers] can have their student debt fully canceled. That’s 20 million people who can start getting on with their lives.”But critics have been quick to point out this scale of loan forgiveness would force all of taxpaying America to pay for student loans disproportionately taken out by a small minority of Americans.Republican Senator Tom Cotton tweeted on the topic:There is no such thing as student loan forgiveness—this is a bailout, paid for by the large majority of Americans who never went to college or who responsibly paid off their debts.— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) August 24, 2022This criticism is grounded in the fact that less than 40% of Americans have a four year undergraduate degree. And only 13% hold graduate degrees that tend to yield higher paying jobs.The inequality of forcing all Americans to foot the bill on these student loans lies in the fact that a whopping 56% of all student loans taken out in America are taken out by the 13% who have graduate degrees.But criticism of Biden’s student loan handout plan is not relegated to those on the right. Critics on the left have also slammed the plan as one that will aggravate already record high inflation ratesTop Obama economic advisor Larry Summers has argued extending the student loan repayment program or simply wiping away student debt at this time would make inflation worse.I hope the Administration does not contribute to inflation macro economically by offering unreasonably generous student loan relief or micro economically by encouraging college tuition increases.— Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) August 22, 2022Biden’s plan would cost up to $950 Billion over the next 10 years.Summers has softened his criticism of Biden’s plan by calling for a bankruptcy release valve to be made available for students seeking debt relief. A position long advocated by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren.As Biden concluded his remarks Wednesday laying out his debt forgiveness plan, he refused to answer any questions about whether his plan was fair to those Americans who did not have student loans or had already paid them off.TOPICS:Joe BidennewsOANOANNpoliticsstudent loan repaymentstudent loansWhite House SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/bidens-student-loan-handout-crushing-the-poor-to-bribe-the-rich/

This investigation eventually led to the unprecedented raid on the former president’s home.“The Biden administration’s raid on President Trump’s home is an outrageous, reckless and unprecedented abuse of power. And the American people have an urgent right to know how the Biden administration manufactured the records dispute used as a pretext for the raid on Trump’s home,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The Biden administration’s unlawful secrecy on its political raid of Trump’s home speaks volumes.”In a separate case, Judicial Watch has moved with some significant success to unseal all warrant materials, including the affidavit used to justify the raid.On August 22, Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart handed down a decision that partially grants Judicial Watch’s request to unseal the affidavit and other materials. He states in the ruling that “given the intense public and historical interest in an unprecedented search of a former President’s residence, the Government has not yet shown that these administrative concerns are sufficient to justify sealing.”TOPICS:Department of JusticeDOJFOIAJudicial WatchJustice DepartmentNational ArchivesnewsOANOANNpolticisRecords Administration SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/judicial-watch-files-foia-lawsuit-against-national-archives-for-hiding-records-tied-to-raid-on-trumps-home/

(Greg Nash/Pool via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:00 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) Director Anthony Fauci is stepping down from his his public health position amid Republican calls to investigate him after they win back the House. Dr. Fauci announced plans to step down in December after holding the position since 1984For Republicans, however, this in no way means Fauci is off the hook. In an interview Monday, House Oversight Ranking Member James Comer (R-Ky.) said retirement will not shield Fauci from congressional scrutiny. He said Fauci will be held accountable for apparently lying about the origins of COVID-19, gain-of-function research and his mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak. Comer also said a Republican majority in Congress will hold Fauci’s NIH (National Institutes of Health) accountable for the improper use of taxpayer funds to fund questionable research in China.One of the largest thorns in Fauci’s side, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), could potentially be the next chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

6:38 AM PT",CAUGHT! Biden White House Directly Involved in Trump DOJ Probe MONTHS Before Raid,"CAUGHT! Biden White House Directly Involved in Trump DOJ Probe MONTHS Before RaidChanel Rion, OAN Chief White House CorrespondentUPDATED 6:38 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022Biden White House has been in talks with the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) criminal probe into Donald Trump for months – contrary to what the White House has claimed. Government documents reviewed by Just the News this week expose major holes in the Biden White House narrative.Newly reviewed memos between the Biden White House and the FBI, DOJ, and the National Archives show the White House as early as April was involved in discussions surrounding Trump’s papers and documents. According to documents reviewed by Just the News, then White House Deputy Legal Counsel Jonathan Su this May told the National Archives President Biden would “not object to waiving [President Trump’s] claims of executive privilege.”This statement from Joe Biden’s White House served as the green light for DOJ to procure a subpoena demanding Trump return papers from his presidency that might be at Mar-a-Lago.A May 10 letter from Acting National Archivist Debra Steidel Wall to Trump’s legal team confirmed the White House’s role and prior knowledge in the DOJ probe against Trump:“On April 11, 2022, the White House Counsel’s Office — affirming a request from the Department of Justice supported by an FBI letterhead memorandum — formally transmitted a request that NARA provide the FBI access to the 15 boxes for its review within seven days, with the possibility that the FBI might request copies of specific documents following its review of the boxes,” wrote Wall.Wall goes on to justify ignoring Trump’s executive privilege citing President Biden himself:“The Counsel to the President has informed me that, in light of the particular circumstances presented here, President Biden defers to my determination, in consultation with the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, regarding whether or not I should uphold the former President’s purported ‘protective assertion of executive privilege.’ …I have therefore decided not to honor the former President’s ‘protective’ claim of privilege.”These correspondences confirm the Biden White House directly participated in a process key to empowering the DOJ raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence on August 8.Ultimately, these revelations cast doubt on statements by Biden officials claiming no advance knowledge of the raid and raise more questions about what Biden officials did know prior to the August 8 raid.TOPICS:Chanel RionDebra Steidel WallDOJDonald TrumpFBIJoe BidenMar-a-LagoNational ArchivesnewsOANOANNpoliticsPresident TrumpprobeRAIDWhite House SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/caught-biden-white-house-directly-involved-in-trump-doj-probe-months-before-raid/

(MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:27 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022A new report reveals a connection between the alleged kidnapping plot of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago. According to Just the News, FBI official Steven D’Antuono is in charge of the bureau’s field office in Washington that raided 45th President Donald Trump’s Florida home.Back in 2020, D’Antuono was in charge of the Detroit office when the Whitmer kidnapping case took place. The report cites a trial testimony which says the Detroit FBI office “instigated, encouraged and facilitated” the Whitmer plot.Republican officials say both the Whitmer case and the Trump raid show the FBI is weaponized for political purposes. GOP officials, like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, say both the Whitmer case and the Trump raid show the FBI is weaponized for political purposes.“We’re seeing what’s happening with this Michigan kidnapping hoax, which is a total disaster for the bureau,” DeSantis noted. “You look at what’s happened with FBI agents surveil parents going to school board meetings. Who would have ever thought that? So I think when Republicans look at that and they’re upset about it, it’s against the backdrop of that conduct where basically there agencies have become the enforcement arm of one particular faction our country against everybody else.”Suspects in the Whitmer case, Adam Fox and Barry Croft, were convicted Tuesday although they were acquitted in April on the grounds they had been entrapped by the FBI.","A crest of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is seen 03 August 2007 inside the J.

McCabe, OAN National CorrespondentUPDATED 6:38 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022Florida Republican Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis rallied Friday in a packed-out Pittsburgh ballroom for the Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial nominee looking to succeed Democratic Gov. Thomas W. Wolf less than 90 days from Nov. 8 election day.“Our message to Pennsylvania is clear, and we have a stark choice,” said state Sen. Douglas V. Mastriano (R.-33), facing the Democratic nominee Attorney General Joshua D. Shapiro.“We had the continuation of eight years of failed policies, vis-a-vis Tom Wolf in the form of Josh Shapiro, who’s for six years has been our attorney general, and as our senior law enforcement official, the state crime has gone up 37 percent, overdose deaths, we’re number eight in the nation, 12th in homicides, fourth specifically in fentanyl deaths,” the retired Army colonel said.Mastriano said in addition to his failure at the commonwealth’s attorney general, Shapiro has personal failings that should preclude him from holding public office. “He’s a failure. He’s ambitious. He’s a vain glorious man looking for his own glory and he’s done nothing with the job he had at hand.”The rally with DeSantis was part of the governor’s “Unite and Win” tour, sponsored by Turning Point USA, the political wing of the conservative youth organization led by its founder Charlie Kirk.“We are thrilled that Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida came up to campaign with us. Pennsylvania is the Keystone State,” the state senator said.When Mastriano took the stage, accompanied by his wife Rebecca, he wasted no time telling the faithful what to expect from his administration.“On day one, all executive orders and mandates or restrictions that destroy businesses and infringe upon your freedoms will be over,” he said.“I’ll be rolling back over one-third of the regulations in the first 100 days of my administration,” he said. “I will hold state officials accountable for enforcing law and prosecuting crime–that’s right. I will have the backs of our beautiful law enforcement.”The state senator, whose district includes the home and library of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, said he had a special plan for the planeloads of illegal aliens President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sends into the Keystone State.“Pennsylvania will not be host to illegal immigrants anymore—and when those ghost flights show up in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania State Police will greet them and escort them to Joe Biden’s house in Delaware,” he said.When DeSantis took the stage, the crowd erupted, and the governor took it from there, taking on the leftists trying to rework America’s culture.“This woke ideology is a really destructive mind virus. And what it’s done is it is infecting different institutions in our society, the medical establishment,” he said. “That’s why they’re doing these sex changes on the minors, or they want to do it.”It is also going on in the schools, he said.“You see it in education. You see it in these different things. It’s a very oppressive ideology. It’s totally divorced from reality,” DeSantis said.“We can’t just stand idly by while woke ideology ravages every institution in our society. We must fight the woke in our schools. We must fight the woke in our businesses. We must fight the woke in government agencies,” he said. “We can never ever surrender to woke ideology—and I’ll tell you this, the state of Florida is where woke goes to die.”After he wound up the crowd, DeSantis then sent the whipped-up activists out with his marching orders.“So, put on the full armor of God, take a stand against the left schemes. Stand your ground. Stand firm. Don’t back down. We can do this,” he said.“I’m going to be working to keep the state of Florida free and you guys have an opportunity to make Pennsylvania free.

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby commended the move. He stressed that the strikes were necessary to prevent future attacks on American troops.“As you heard from CENTCOM, these strikes were a direct response to attacks and ongoing threats against U.S. forces by Iran-backed groups, just like the ones we saw on August 15th,” said Kirby. “As before, we don’t seek escalation, but we remain prepared to respond to any ongoing threat. We took this action because the President determined it was in our national interest to do so.”Kirby also touched on the developing talks between European, Iranian and American diplomats regarding the resurrection of the 2015 nuclear deal. Israeli officials, including its current Prime Minister and last two Prime Minsters, have all come out against America agreeing to the deal. They all warned of the devastating impact the deal would have on Israel. I just spoke with my friend, President @EmmanuelMacron.We discussed the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.Iran cannot be allowed to endlessly buy time and receive more concessions while it advances its nuclear program and spreads terror worldwide. pic.twitter.com/HN6cOEx6d6— יאיר לפיד – Yair Lapid (@yairlapid) August 22, 2022נלחם בתקשורת האמריקנית נגד הסכם הגרעין המסוכן עם איראן >> pic.twitter.com/t7u2RoqkeU— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) August 24, 2022I call on @POTUS Biden & the US administration to refrain, even now at this last minute, from signing the agreement with Iran.

That’s why we’re so focused on a diplomatic outcome to that, to see that result in a return to the JCPOA. But I think it’s important to be clear whether or not we reach a return to the JCPOA, the president’s commitment to protect U.S. personnel and confront Iran’s malign behaviors in the region that jeopardize our people or our friends will stay unwavering.”Meanwhile, on the Ukraine front, the Biden administration is looking to fork over another three-billion-dollars worth of military aid to the country to celebrate the sixth month mark of the crisis with Russia. Reports say that the military industrial complex has already contributed $10-point-six-billion worth of equipment to Ukraine. Kirby embattled former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and many members of the United Nations Security council who decried Russia’s efforts in Ukraine. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, shared her support for country.“Let’s be clear. The international community will never recognize Russia’s attempt to change Ukraine’s borders by force,” Thomas-Greenfield said. Meanwhile, recent analyses of Joe Biden’s handling of foreign policy, has concluded that his method has been destructive to the international community and to America’s image on the world stage.  Former Trump administration Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, David Schenker, combated the Biden administration’s assertion that the Middle East is the most stable it’s been in years. Schenker pointed out that Iraq has fallen prey to the influence of Iranian terrorists and bolstering the Ayatollah’s geo-political position in the region. Additionally, other experts ingrained in the fabric of America’s foreign policy, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, have lamented that America’s foreign policy now has no compass, predicting a greater war with Russia and China could come about if the Biden administration keeps course.","President Joe Biden waves after returning to the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022.

While many election pundits are citing this win as a signal of a dying red wave, Richard Baris, the director of Big Data Poll, says there is no other way to spin it.“I think it’s significant that the Democrats won that seat,” Baris said. Pat Ryan beat Mullinaro. There’s no way to spin that otherwise.” Baris did note turnout in this special election was down by about 200,000 votes from the historical norm. Baris says New York’s 19th Congressional District usually draws about 350,000 votes. For example, in the 2020 general election, this same district drew a total of 352,771 votes. But Tuesday evening, only 128,991 people turned in their ballot to vote. Baris says this is a sign the GOP is struggling to move the needle without former President Donald Trump on the ballot. “What this tells me in New York 19 is that without Donald Trump involved in some of these fights,” Baris explained. “Whether he is trying to beat a more establishment candidate in a nomination, or his candidate is just favored and he’s, he’s there driving excitement up, Republicans are having a hard time on their own getting people excited.”President Joe Biden carried New York 19 by less than 2 percentage points in 2020. Ryan claimed 51.1% (65,943) of the vote with Molinaro only securing 48.8% (62,952). Ryan is an Ulster County executive and will only serve four months in the current district. Baris says Molinaro should have won this seat.“[He] did about as well in Dutchess County, which is his own backyard, Biden won that area,” Baris explained. “He did about as well as any Republican could have. We have to remember that the district still did swing about 11 points in favor of Republicans. And the fact is Democrats can’t afford that in many of these districts across the country.”Baris says the big takeaway from the race is that the GOP is struggling to turn out the vote without the 45th president.“The big picture for me is that without Donald Trump on that ballot, they have a hard time bringing out lower propensity working class people who are not sold on the Republican party,” said Baris. “This idea of moving on from Donald Trump, [the voters] not ready to do that yet. It’s clear.”TOPICS:Big Data PollDonald TrumpDutchess CountyelectionNew YorknewsOANOANNPat RyanpoliticsREPUBLICANSRichard BarisVOTING SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/richard-baris-its-clear-gop-voters-not-ready-to-move-on-from-trump/

The board held termination hearings to decide the employment fate of Uvalde School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:05 PM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022Members of the Uvalde school board voted to remove Police Chief Pete Arredondo over his response to the Robb Elementary Shooting. The unanimous vote has terminated the contract of the disgraced Police Chief.During a meeting on Wednesday, the school board secretary Laura Perez made the motion to remove Arredondo from his position. Her motion received an overwhelming amount of support from members of the board.Prior to this, Arredondo had already turned in his resignation letter after being heavily criticized for his actions during the shooting incident at Robb Elementary which left 21 people dead including 19 children.“Mister Board President, I move that good cause exist to terminate the non-certified contract of Pete Arredondo effectively immediately,” said Perez. “I further move that good cause exist to ratify the unpaid leave status of Mister Arredondo starting July 19, 2022. Finally I move to authorize the superintendent to issue written notice to Mister Arredondo of this board action including filing any needed reports required by the termination.”Members of the community were left unsatisfied despite the decision to strip the school district Police Chief of his title. Robb Elementary student, Caitlyn Gonzalez, lambasted the police who were present at the school during the incident saying they ‘don’t reserve to wear a badge’.Before Uvalde CISD voted to fire Pete Arredondo, a young Uvalde girl demanded that law enforcement who responded at Robb ""turn in your badge and step down."" https://t.co/OJRzBkMxQY pic.twitter.com/LDiSBaSVWP— KENS 5 (@KENS5) August 25, 2022“I have messages for Pete Arredondo and all the law enforcement that were there that day: turn in your badge, and step down,” said Gonzalez. “You don’t deserve to wear one.”Another Uvalde resident, Daniel Myers, expressed his outrage at the school board. He accused them of not caring about the families who were affected by the tragedy. Myers also believes the board was trying to cover up the incident by dismissing Arredondo.“You guys don’t care a squawk about these families,” claimed Meyers. “If it was one of your children, hands would be rolling right now. But because it’s not, you don’t care. You are not going to sweep this under the rug. You’re not. All of you are accountable.”In the meantime, several government agencies including the FBI have launched investigations into the police response to the shooting.","Texas Department of Safety Troopers stand by for a meeting of the Board of Trustees of Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas.

The Senator called on Democrat voters to help put an end to the radical progressivism which he said has taken over the party.Rubio appeared alongside Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida Attorney-General Ashley Moody on Tuesday after all three won their primaries unopposed. With his sights on the general election, Rubio called on Democrat voters to take a good look at their party.A red wave is coming pic.twitter.com/cR03z4sdsn— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 25, 2022The Republican acknowledged that many voters still viewed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as the party of the working class.“If you’re a Democrat or a working class Democrat, maybe you’ve voted Democrat your whole life because your parents were members of unions, or you’re a member of a union, or for whatever reason,” said Rubio. “I say to you tonight, your party has abandoned you”.However, Rubio argued that sentiment is no longer the case as democratic policies have ravaged the American people with no sign of stopping.“The Democratic Party has been taken over by radical left wing lunatics, laptop liberals and Marxist misfits,” claimed Rubio. “Those are the people who have taken over that party. I wish this country had two normal political parties so we can debate should the taxes be 18 percent or 19 percent. But that’s not what we debate anymore. We debate crazy things. Insanity”Rubio said that the country is so polarized because America’s two major political parties share no common ground. He claimed that while Republicans hold the United States in high regard, the Democrats hate the core values of America and wish to destroy it. The Senator declared the fight for the nation is not over. He called on still patriotic Democrats to help save America.“And when we win in November, we’re going to put a stop to this destruction,” the Senator said. “And then, God willing, in two years, someone will be in the White House that isn’t this guy, with common sense, with an understanding about America’s future, that believes in the greatness of our country. And we will save our country and we will leave for our children what our parents, what our grandparents, what previous Americans left for us: the single greatest country in the history of all of mankind. We need to go win and we need your help”.Rubio will face off against Trump’s impeachment manager, representative Val Demings, in order to retain his seat this November.","Republican Senator from Florida Marco Rubio speaks during a rally in support of Republican gubernatorial incumbent Gov.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks to members of the press at Russell Senate Office Building March 24, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:32 AM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022The looming agreement of another Iran nuclear deal is mobilizing critics from around the world who are trying to block the deal from being enforced. As European diplomats are close to inking a nuclear deal with Iran, critics vow to make sure an agreement doesn’t see the light of day. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R- Texas) stressed that Iran is not an actor that negotiates in good faith. The Texas Republican pointed out that Iran is trying to hunt down American officials and dissidents on US soil and that they even failed to comply with the standards imposed during the 2015 Obama era deal. He went on to note that a new deal would empower the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps to continue carrying out terrorist activities in Yemen and Israel. Cruz claimed it would lift the sanction that President Trump imposed on the rogue state and that a new deal could instead pump trillions-of-dollars into its economy.Complete horse manure.The Iran nuclear deal is designed to let the Ayatollah cheat his way to a nuclear arsenal.These so-called ""most rigorous and intensive"" inspections failed in the last deal – and will be even weaker this time.Let's review the actual facts. 🧵 1/X https://t.co/8hWVD4Hy3y— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) August 24, 2022Additionally, Cruz warned that the new agreement would allow Iran to have a nuclear arsenal, something that he’s been adamant against since the Obama administration. “President Biden wants nothing more than to re-enter a deal that is even worse than the Obama deal,” claimed Cruz. “In Vienna, Biden diplomats have been furiously bending over backwards to surrender to the Ayatollah. The same Ayatollah who is a theocratic despot regularly chants ‘death to America’ and ‘death to Israel.’ This administration wants nothing more than to give them hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Money that will inevitably be used to number one to murder Americans, Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and number two to develop nuclear weapons.”Meanwhile, Israel set up meetings with the White House to argue their side of the debate. On Tuesday, Israel’s National Security Advisor met with his counterpart Jake Sullivan in Washington to make it known to Joe Biden that its strongest ally in the Middle East has real concerns with the deal. This comes ahead of a meeting between Sullivan and Israel’s Defense Minister Benny Gantz. The two are scheduled to talk on Friday. Former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, said he hopes Biden hears his calls to back away from the deal. Bennett stressed that his country could face dire consequences. I call on @POTUS Biden & the US administration to refrain, even now at this last minute, from signing the agreement with Iran. This agreement will send approximately a quarter of a trillion dollars to the Iranian terror administration's pocket and to its regional proxies, >>— Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) August 23, 2022“There are those who think they deserve to have their sanctions removed and hundreds of billions of dollars poured right into their rotten regime. They’re wrong,” Bennett said. “Iran deserves no rewards, no bargain deals and no sanctions relief in return for their brutality.”However, the State Department maintained that it will not back down from its mission to accomplish its main foreign policy goal since occupying the executive branch. State Department Spokesperson, Ned Price, said diplomats will keep trying to convince Americans that a return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is much needed to secure America’s national security interest. Price said there are still issues Iran needs to air out, including not giving answers to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) probe into undeclared traces of enriched uranium in its nuclear facility. “Iran needs to answer the IAEA’s questions,” said Price. “This is the only way to address these issues once and for all. Our position is not going to change regardless of where we express it – in the text of an understanding, a mutual return to full information of the JCPOA in public or elsewhere. We are… unbending in our support of the IAEA, in support of the IAEA mandates and the independence of the IAEA that is core to that mandate.”In the meantime, it seems the Biden administration is waiting to respond to criticisms of agreeing to a deal with Iran until after the meetings with Israeli officials. Iran issued a written statement to the European Union last week signaling an end to negotiations, but American diplomats decried some of the proposals calling them impossible. The Biden administration has yet to respond to Iran’s proposal which is casting a shadow of uncertainty around the deal. ","WASHINGTON, DC – MARCH 24: U.S. Sen.

The Nevada County Sheriff-Coroner has identified the decedent as 16-year-old Kiely Rodni, of Truckee.  More info: https://t.co/a18rag5KH0 pic.twitter.com/uvXFV7WbO3— Nevada County Sheriff's Office (@NevCoSheriff) August 23, 2022The Truckee 16-year-old was reported missing after attending a party with hundreds of people on August sixth at Prosser Family Campground. Her disappearance led local, state and federal agencies to spend about 20,000 man-hours searching the area. Adventures With Purpose, a private group of divers, located Rodnis’ vehicle near the campground. Her car was upside down and submerged 14-feet underwater. It was located about 55-feet offshore. Doug Bishop, a representative of Adventures With Purpose, released a statement on the group’s Youtube channel. “We understand that the resource we provide with our unique skill set is rare,” said Bishop. “It is an honor to help agencies and families all across the nation.”Before their discovery, other teams sent by authorities had already searched the lake several times prior. When asked about how officials weren’t able to locate her car in areas that had already been searched, Nevada County Deputy Sheriff Sam Brown spoke to reporters. “How did we not find it when we were searching? The lake was extensively searched…” explained Brown. “We had divers, we had swimmers. I think that’s part of what we’re going to have to go back to do and debrief.”Local police said they’re going to look at how they can improve its resources and review strategies for deep water searches. Further details such as the cause of death have not been released. A toxicology report could take four-to-six weeks. The sheriff does not suspect foul play and how Kiely ended up in the water remains under investigation.Meanwhile, officers said they are in contact with Rodni’s family. The family thanked law enforcement, volunteers and everyone who’s shown them support.",In this undated photo released by the Placer County Sheriff’s Office is Kiely Rodni.
