They are all part of new TV commercial released Sept. 7 by the campaign of Florida Republican Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis.“Ladies and gentlemen, Gov. Ron DeSantis,” said an announcer as the governor stepped up to the podium to say: “Today, we deliver for the people of Florida yet again.”In all, more than 20 people from all walks of Florida life thanked the governor for keeping Florida businesses, schools and houses of worship open, and for other stands he took.Some of the gratitude came with a political allusion to the culture wars waged in the state and in the Nation, such as the young female swimmer thanking DeSantis for letting her compete and the police officer thanking him for raising the pay for law enforcement.The firefighter in the commercial thanked the governor in Spanish.The DeSantis campaign is just getting started. This cycle, the Florida governor has raised more than $170 million, compared to only $15 million for his Democratic rival, Charlie Crist.TOPICS:Charlie CristFloridaNeil W.

They thrive on chaos.”Standing against a now infamous blood red backdrop, Biden ominously warned that MAGA Republicans “live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies.”Biden went on to label all MAGA Republicans and followers of former President and likely 2024 contender as enemies of democracy itself. In subsequent Labor Day speeches in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Biden could be found speaking to small rallies and softening his tone:From Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Biden found himself walking back his Philadelphia rant:“I want to be very clear upfront. Not every Republican is a MAGA-Republican. Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career,” But that day, Biden went on to attack modern day Republicans as radically evolved from Republicans with whom he has dealt in the past:“This is not your father’s Republican Party. This is a totally different party, man. These guys are different.”With Biden’s approval numbers in the low forties, the Biden White House is trying to restructure Biden as the new and energetic warrior against MAGA Republicans. But it’s clear the energy on the campaign trail seems to be lacking.

McCabe — OAN National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 7:09 AM PT – Wednesday, September 7, 2022(MIDDLEBURG, VA.) Nearly 10 years after Edward Stone revealed the extent of government surveillance of Americans and American life the founder of Blackwater told One American News his new Unplugged phone and operating system, LibertOS, are designed to provide encrypted peer-to-peer comps immune from government access.“We have developed a completely independent phone platform called Unplugged Systems,” said Erik D. Prince, the patriot businessman and ally of President Donald J. Trump.“It is its own hardware, its own operating system, our operating system, with its own secure messenger, VPN, antivirus and store,” he said.The author of the book “Civilian Warriors,” said his team learned the lessons from so-called secure communication apps.“The unique thing about our messenger, for example, is when you download Signal or Wicker, you get one encryption key the first time,” he said. “Ours generates a new encryption, key every call, and it’s all peer-to-peer, and nothing of the message data is stored on our servers at all.”Prince said without your data and outside U.S. government territory, there is no way the government gets in.“If a warrant were ever to be delivered to the company to say: ‘Turn over these people’s user data or their files’–it’s impossible because we store and keep nothing,” he said.Because the OS does not have an advertiser ID function, there is no process to track users or sell their data, he said.“Our phone does not collect any user data, OK?” he said. “Google and Apple both collect and resell about $180 of your data every year. They know where you go, what you buy, what you browse, and whom you call, and they resell that data to advertisers without your permission.”The Navy SEAL veteran said the apps are available now for Android phones with iPhones next, and the phones will be shipping out in the first quarter of 2023.“The pendulum of big government and big tech has swung way too far in one direction in the surveillance state,” he said.“Our goal with Unplugged, our mission statement is to make that pendulum swing back towards individual liberty and individual privacy right now.”TOPICS:AndroidBlackwaterDonald TrumpEdward StoneErik Princegovernmentgovernment surveillanceiPhoneLibertOSNavy SealNeil W.

McCabe — OAN National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 6:56 AM PT – Wednesday, September 7, 2022(PLAISTOW, N.H.) Among the dozens of veterans from President Donald J. Trump’s administration are running for office this cycle is a former White House press staffer, who went home to become a New Hampshire GOP House hopeful.“I had the honor of serving as an assistant press secretary in President Trump’s White House,” said Karoline Leavitt, who is running for the Republican nomination in the Sept. 13 primary for the New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, and the chance to face Democrat Rep. Christopher C. Pappas.The graduate of Saint Anselm said she learned quickly about the reality of how the swamp brings the press and the establishment together against the MAGA movement.“The mainstream biased media colluded with the Democrat Party, with Joe Biden’s campaign to censor and silence negative stories about Joe Biden, most infamously the Hunter Biden laptop story, and then pushed negative and false propaganda about President Trump,” she said.“They played an immense role in interfering in our 2020 election,” the former press aide said.The House hopeful said it was especially frustrating to work with reporters at the White House every day who were committed to pushing fake news she said.“Well, I interacted with the White House press corps in my role every single day and I was always shocked by how their questions were always coming from a place of innate bias against President Trump,” she said.“They were always being dishonest just in their line of questioning and they were refusing to look at the standard and basic facts,” Leavitt said.“The coming back home and hearing the humbling stories of my future constituents, I mean, gas is through the roof, inflation is skyrocketing, life is incredibly unaffordable right now,” she said.“It’s because of the politicians in Washington on both sides of the aisle, frankly, who don’t give a damn about the average American, like my family,” she said.A recent University of New Hampshire poll put Leavitt in a virtual tie with Matt Mowers, a former political operative of Chris Christie’s and transplant from New Jersey.“That’s why the establishment and the swamp do not want me to win this race. I’m in a hotly contested primary, and my opponent is being funded by the establishment in DC,” Leavitt said.“I am not. I am funded and supported by the people of New Hampshire,” she said.“That’s something I’m very proud of because I will only be beholden to them.”TOPICS:Chris PappasDemocrat PartyDonald TrumpelectionGOPHunter BidenJoe BidenMAGAMAGA MovementNeil W.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:23 AM PT – Tuesday, September 6, 2022The Biden administration has continued its crusade against the MAGA movement. The President appears to keep choosing divisiveness as he rails against Trump supporters.While speaking at a rally on Monday, Biden accused the MAGA movement of being anti-Semitic, comparing them to the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis. His remarks came in spite of him running on a campaign of being a “great unifier,” but has recently proved otherwise by calling America First Republicans semi-fascist and a threat to democracy.“But then we moved to this place where all of a sudden, the reason that made me run I decided was when you saw those people come out of the fields down in Virginia carrying torches, literally coming out of the fields, carrying torches with swastikas, chanting the same anti-Semitic bylaws chanted in literally the same anti-Semitic bile, chanted in Germany in the thirties by the Ku Klux Klan,” Biden stated. “And the guy that I beat in this last election, and when they asked what he thought, he said there were really fine people on both sides. This is something really wrong. Something is changing. “Meanwhile, in the city of Boston, Vice President Kamala Harris voiced her frustration at Republican states trying to maintain the integrity of their elections. These include measures that ban the use of ballot drop boxes and requiring voters to show some form of identification.“We travel to do the work of reminding folks that when they stood in those lines for four hours, when they had to find childcare to drop off their ballot, when they navigated the obstacles that certain states are putting up for them to have access to the vote, when they put in their order in 2020 for what they wanted,” Harris noted. “We gave them most of what they asked for, but we need to see it through.”However, Biden maintained that not all Republicans supported the America First agenda, referring to lawmakers such as Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who have been labeled as RINOs by 45th President Donald Trump.“I want to be very clear up front, not every Republican is MAGA Republican,” Biden stated. “Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with mainstream Republicans in my whole career, but the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards. Full of anger, violence, hate and division. But together, we can and we must choose a different path forward.”In the meantime, a red wave is expected to hit in this year’s midterm elections with many Trump-endorsed candidates competing to take control of Congress.","President Joe Biden listens as Vice President Kamala Harris speaks after meeting with leaders from Georgia’s Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, Friday, March 19, 2021, at Emory University in Atlanta.

A new poll by CBS News and YouGov found 64 percent of respondents believe America will see further rise in political violence in coming years. This compared to just 51 percent who expected an increase in political violence in January 2021.The Biden administration is now under fire for labeling Donald Trump supporters as “dangerous extremists,” which critics say fuels more political division. Republicans are asserting that Biden should work to solve the crises he created, instead of pitting Americans against one another.“I was stunned at how divisive this speech was last night,” said Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin (R) in regards to President Biden’s recent primetime address. “And at a time where people across America, I know in Virginia, are worried about some of the most basic issues: rising inflation and trying to make ends meet, crime and oh by the way education challenges. And it’s a time when, in fact, we’ve gotta focus on these issues and our President jumped out and was incredibly divisive, trying to pit Americans against one another.”Joe Biden is an anti-worker president: •Real wages are down•56% of Americans say their financial situation is getting WORSE•The average American has $11,000 LESS in savings than last yearBiden does not care about working Americans.— GOP (@GOP) September 6, 2022The poll also found only 10 percent of Americans expect political violence to subside moving forward.","President Joe Biden speaks outside Independence Hall, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2022, in Philadelphia.

The former Secretary of State said that then FBI director, James Comey, ruined her chances of getting elected.“There’s no doubt at all that he (James Comey) impacted very negatively my chances of winning,” Clinton said. “So, it was in the middle of an election, there was no ‘there there’ and the guy never shut up.”Clinton then went on to praise the current leaders of the DOJ and FBI. She claimed they’ve been “incredibly patient and careful.”Her remarks come as many believe the current FBI and DOJ are biased against former President Trump.

McCabe — OAN National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 2:51 PM PT – Wednesday, September 7, 2022(MIDDLEBURG, VA.) One year after the fall of Kabul, the founder of Blackwater told One America News his warnings were about Afghanistan were ignored by incompetent military leaders and national security professionals.“Because the Pentagon is all about money and power, as any bureaucracy is, and so they mobilized and moved in—and when Bagram becomes a saluting zone and a no-beard zone and a starched khaki zone, all progress stopped,” said Erik Prince, whose book “Civilian Warriors,” told the story of his private military company and how he brought private enterprise thinking to the war on terror.“In addition to the closed-minded generals who were constantly rotated in and out of theater, the highly educated American national security professionals were equally clueless about Afghanistan,” the Navy SEAL veteran said.“They abysmally failed, and they’ve wasted trillions of dollars and thousands of our sons’ and daughters’ lives and limbs,” he said.Prince said one galling example of American mismanagement of the war in Afghanistan was the refusal to reboot and develop the Soviet-era oil production in the Angot field.Instead, the U.S. insisted on importing oil to support the war with massive markups that included bribes to the Taliban as we were fighting the Taliban, he said.“Up until the last day, all the energy supply that the United States and NATO needed in Afghanistan was trucked in,” he said.“It was boated down from the Med, up by truck from Karachi, up through the Taliban areas, paying a huge toll. About a third of the Taliban’s operating budget was collecting tolls on all those U.S. trucks,” he said.The patriot businessman said it is a tragedy that one year after the fall of Kabul, there are still Americans and American allies left behind, and the country has become the terrorist safe haven the war was fought to prevent.“I would say between citizens and Green Card holders, it’s definitely in the thousands yet, so there is genuine despair,” the Hillsdale College graduate said.“It’s going to be a rough winter there. With the cost of energy up globally and the economy in Afghanistan effectively frozen, it’s going to be a rough winter,” Prince said.“I would say you’ll see some significant fighting once the fighting season starts again come May, June of next year because there’s a lot of people that are just not going to take it anymore.”",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Former Trump White House Press Aide Runs For Granite State House SeatTOPICS:AfghanistanErik PrincenewsOANOANNpoliticsterrorist TWEETPIN,https://www.oann.com/erik-prince-afghanistan-the-terrorist-haven-we-fought-to-stop-after-bidens-botched-withdrawal/

Gen. Patrick Ryder holds a news briefing at the Pentagon. https://t.co/DfJJkpG7f1— Department of Defense 🇺🇸 (@DeptofDefense) September 6, 2022The Biden administration warned the public about a new adversary to the Biden administration that might join forces with Russia. During a press conference on Tuesday, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen Pat Ryder warned that Russia is asking for millions of rockets, artillery shells and other ammo from the Hermit Kingdom- North Korea. US intelligence reports also revealed that Russia has inked a deal for future military aid with Kim Jong-un.“We do have indications that Russia has approached North Korea to request ammunition,” Ryder announced. “I’m not able to provide any more detail than that at this point in time. But it does demonstrate and is indicative of the situation that Russia finds itself in, in terms of its logistics and sustainment capabilities as it relates to Ukraine.”White House National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby claimed this is a sign that the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is growing desperate.“It is, if you if you don’t mind me furthering this a little bit, it is just another indication of how desperate Putin’s becoming,” Kirby said. “He was buying drones from Iran. Now he’s going to buy artillery rounds from North Korea. It’s an indication of how much his defense industrial establishment is suffering as a result of this war and the degree of desperation that he’s reaching out to countries like Iran and North Korea for assistance. But no indication that they’re on the battlefield right now.”However, Russia has been bringing together America’s adversaries since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict. The Kremlin has been working with Iran and China to subvert western sanctions and to set up streams of military aid. The Chinese Communist Party agreed to allow Russia to wire money in the Chinese currency to bypass international sanctions barring Russia from using the SWIFT Banking System. This apparent resurrection of a Sino-Russia Cold War alliance is also solidified by recent war games being carried out by the Chinese and Russian militaries.Meanwhile, Russia has been working out a deal to sell sanctioned oil to Iran. The Country has received shipments of Iran-made drones to use against Ukraine-backed forces. But the Biden administration is welcoming a new friend in the West’s campaign against Russia, Liz Truss. Truss is the United Kingdom’s new Prime Minister. Vedant Patel, the Principal Deputy Spokesperson for the US State Department spoke about the relationship the two countries have.“The UK and the US are the closest of friends and allies and we look forward to continuing our close cooperation with Prime Minister Truss and the new Government on a range of important priorities, including continued support to Ukraine in the face of Russia’s war,” Patel said.In the meantime, Joe Biden is looking to continue funding Ukraine’s military amid Russia’s invasion. His latest request to Congress exceeded $13 billion in military aid. This latest request is in addition to the $40 billion aid package that was approved earlier this year. Some analysts have said that since Russia has yet to topple the Ukrainian government, the Biden security apparatus believes it can help Ukraine trounce Russia.","Pentagon spokesman Air Force Brig.

In order to ease these concerns, an eight-foot metal fence was installed around several campuses with more than three dozen State Troopers being deployed as security detail. This comes after the district decided to have Robb Elementary students attend two other schools in light of the tragedy.“You know there was some reluctance from some parents and it’s understandable, as parents we want what is best for our children, we want to know that they are safe, we want that assurance that the school district is doing what they can to provide a safe environment for our students,” Garza stated.Despite this, Uvalde parents expressed doubt about these new safety precautions. Those who decided to opt out of sending their children to school were given the option to have them learn virtually.Michael Martinez, whose stepson was present on the day of the tragedy, was one of those parents who was skeptical about these new safety measures.“If they aren’t no actions, nothing is going to make me feel better. They can put up a big fence, barbed wire, whatever but all it takes is a car just running into it- it ain’t going to stop nothing,” Martinez said. “Are the police officers going to shoot this time? Or are they going to help or what? But nobody really knows, so that’s why we say we are going to take it day-by-day.”Additionally, some students remain anxious about the prospect of returning to school.“When he got in the building today, he was nervous. But right over there, before everything he was normal. If something is burning he freaks out because he says they reminds him of the gun. There are certain parents of the deceased (that) when he sees them he freaks out. It’s a lot of stuff,” Martinez said when talking about his stepson.In the meantime, school officials have announced that Robb Elementary will be demolished and rebuilt.","UVALDE, TEXAS – MAY 26: A memorial is seen surrounding the Robb Elementary School sign following the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School on May 26, 2022 in Uvalde, Texas.

(Anna Rose Layden/Pool Photo via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:31 AM PT – Wednesday, September 7, 2022GOP Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is prepared to slug it out against Democrat challenger Rep. Val Demings to retain his seat. In August, Demings trounced her three primary opponents winning 85 percent of the vote.Demings has served three terms in Congress and was the chief of Orlando police department from 2007 to 2011. However, despite her law enforcement background, the Fraternal Order of Police and multiple Florida sheriffs have put their weigh behind Rubio. This is likely due to Deming’s close ties to “defund the police” Democrats, who’s policies have ushered in crime waves throughout America’s cities.“The other candidate in this race, however, Val Deming’s turned her back on her profession and she stood with the soft on crime crowd in Washington D.C.,” stated Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey. “And in doing so, put our citizens and our law enforcement officers at risk. For someone who claims to have been a cop and to have worn the badge; what she did in Washington D.C. to support criminals forever tarnished any badge she ever wore. And sadly, she did it to further her own political career.”Demings has been a large proponent of “re-imagining policing” and supported the Minneapolis City Council’s move to disband its police department. On the economic front, Demings has been a supporter of the large spending packages that preceded the current economic recession. The representative has specifically touted the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, which she says is doing exactly what it was intended to do.﻿Sen. Rubio, by contrast, has positioned himself as a fiscal conservative who claims Democrats’ spending has done nothing but cripple the working class.﻿Demings is a vocal supporter of abortion, believing the procedure should be performed until the point of birth and funded by the government. Rubio has called her stance outrageous. He supports the right to life, but recognizes the statute of state’s rights guaranteed by the Constitution.“I am in favor of laws that protect human life,” stated Rubio. “I do not believe that the dignity of worth of human life is tied to the circumstances of their conception, but I recognize that’s not majority position. And therefore, I’ve always said I support bills that have exceptions. “The Republican Party’s de facto leader is the most polarizing topic for the two candidates. Demings was an impeachment manager against President Donald Trump and has claimed Rubio’s opposition to the Mar-a-Lago raid means he doesn’t truly back the blue.Rubio, however, has come out against the raid while labeling it a gross overreach by the Biden DOJ to knee cap a political opponent.“This raid was about trying to disqualify a likely future election opponent, about trying to intimidate Republicans who oppose the left and about creating a distraction from Biden’s failures,” said the Florida lawmaker.Although he ran against Trump for president in 2016, Rubio shares his strong stances on the border and foreign policy with a commitment to economic de-regulation. Meanwhile, Demings is a proponent of Biden’s so-called green agenda and large government spending plans.Floridians will choose which view is preferable for the Sunshine State when they head to the polls.","Sen.

Richard Burr.Budd is running because he is concerned about the US’ future. He said that jobs in North Carolina are under attack each day from Washington. The Trump-endorsed candidate has suggested cutting back government involvement in the economy to fix the inflation problem in the US.“One of the things you can do, one, stop injecting so much money into the economy,” Budd stated. “The other is going to be, what could we do to incentivize people to produce? Ronald Reagan figured this out with the supply side economics and that is you de-regulate. De-regulation is an important as tax cuts.”In contrast, Budd has highlighted Beasley’s support for the Biden administration’s agenda.“My opponent Cheri Beasley, she doesn’t seem to have any problem with Joe Biden’s agenda,” he noted. “So let’s be clear: Cheri Beasley is the most radical, liberal candidate to ever run for US Senate here in North Carolina.”Biden's war on American energy hurts working families and job creators, and makes America dependent on other countries for fuel.America MUST become energy dominant again.https://t.co/osu0nLMLiE— Congressman Ted Budd (@RepTedBudd) September 6, 2022The Republican nominee is also concerned about the crisis at the southern border and that his Democrat opponent is not holding Biden accountable, but he will. If elected to the Senate, Budd would fight inflation, help secure the border and push back against the Biden administration’s policies.","FILE – In this Nov. 6, 2018 file photo, Rep.
