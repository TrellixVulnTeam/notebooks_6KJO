1:27 PM PT",Biden’s old age has Democrats worried for 2024,"A top House Democrat is already making contingency plans should Joe Biden decide not to run in the 2024 presidential election. While speaking to reporters Monday, House Democrat Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) said his number one choice to replace Biden on the Democrat ticket would be Vice President Kamala Harris.However, Clyburn went on to backpedal his position, while claiming “a Biden presidency is what America needs right now.” Nonetheless, he did admit Biden is at an advanced age and he may not be up for a second term.Meanwhile, David Gergen, who served as an advisor to four presidents, reiterated his belief that Biden and Donald Trump should not run for president in 2024. Gergen added, Biden, who’s currently 79-years-old and Trump, who’s now 76, should “step back from these elections because of their age.”“To take office, the most complex office in the world and most powerful office in the world, one where, you know, the president makes one mistake in judgment and there can be calamitous results,” he explained. “I think that someone who is in their 80s is not an appropriate person to be making those kind of decisions over a four-year period.”Gergen went on to say that a president’s age and the challenges that come with it needs to be explored more fully by medical professionals.“I just think it’s a mistake for either party to put forward people who are going to be essentially trying to run the country in their 80s,” he noted.In the meantime, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that Democrat insiders are skeptical of a possible Biden run in 2024, but are reluctant to come forward and oust him. They said their concern lies with Biden’s age and spiraling approval rating as the Biden administration is overseeing record high inflation rates, gas and food prices.Other reports have noted the large appetite for Republican policies as experts predict a red wave is coming this November. Polls have shown Americans want new leadership in the White House, one that puts the people first.","President Joe Biden speaks about the newly approved COVID-19 vaccines for children under 5, Tuesday, June 21, 2022, from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:07 AM PT – Tuesday, June 21 2022President Joe Biden is facing backlash for saying high gas prices are a “good opportunity” for the country to transition to green energy. While speaking to reporters at a Delaware beach Monday, he defended his approach to runaway inflation and his so-called “clean” energy policies.“My dear mother used to have this expression: for everything lousy, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it.,” Biden stated. “We have a chance here to make a fundamental turn towards renewable energy. Electric vehicles. Not just electric vehicles, but across the board.”His comments were immediately interpreted as “tone deaf” to most Americans, who are now paying more than $5 a gallon for gas. The President said he will decide by the end of the week whether to pause the federal gas tax.Gas prices are at record highs, but don’t worry, Democrats think you can just go buy a $50,000 electric car.— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) May 20, 2022Meanwhile, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) appears to break with the some of the White House’s claims about the economy. During an interview Monday, the Democrat said “for a lot of people” we are in a recession. He added, “if you can’t afford gas you are in a recession.”Clyburn’s comments appear to contradict President Biden’s insistence that a recession is not inevitable as his administration attempts to alleviate high inflation. Despite Biden’s claims, recent polling indicates most Americans already believe the nation is in a recession.","President Joe Biden stops and speaks to members of the media as he walks on the beach with his granddaughter Natalie Biden and daughter Ashley Biden, in Rehoboth Beach, Del., Monday, June 20, 2022.

(Oliver Contreras/The Washington Post via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:54 AM PT – Tuesday, June 21 2022Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) recently criticized mainstream media for trying to stir up partisan hatred against Republicans. During a Monday interview, the Louisiana lawmaker specifically decried the actions of staffers working for “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”Last week, a group of seven CBS employees were arrested for walking the halls of the US Capitol without badges. They were reportedly trying to catch Republican lawmakers off guard, while attempting to interview them through the “dog puppet” character called “Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.”Kennedy said the American people know this was an attempt to make Republicans look bad. He added, Americans don’t take mainstream media seriously.“I’ve said it in another context, that’s why the American people — they are not fooled,” stated the Republican. “They trust the media now like they trust gas station sushi. And the media, everybody knows that — not everybody, but many members of the media — have no self-awareness. They think they are fooling the American people.”Sen. Kennedy also said narratives curated by mainstream media are fueling hysterical outcries against conservatives. These include protests outside the homes of Supreme Court justices violent unrest and cancel culture.Colbert defended his staff during an episode of the show following their arrest by Capitol Police. He noted authorities are more cautious now while alluding the reasoning to be on part of the January 6 protests. Nonetheless, the seven staffers were charged with unlawful entry after disturbance call.According to a Capitol Police statement, “This is an active criminal investigation and may result in additional criminal charges after consultation with the U.S. Attorney.”","Sen.

Just in the month of May, Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 14,000 of unaccompanied minors. This represents an increase of nearly 22 percent since April and the largest month since July 2021, which peaked to nearly 19,000.Although Biden plans to combat the crisis with his Los Angeles declaration plan, analysts doubt his measures will make any difference as they do not appear to directly address the issue.“First, stability and assistance, making sure that communities welcoming refugees can afford to care for them, to educate them, medical care, shelter and job opportunities,” stated the President. “Second, increasing pathways for legal migration throughout the region as well as protections for refugees.”Other countries know they can disrespect our laws and our President without consequence. At his disastrous summit, President Biden declared, “We are transforming our approach to MANAGE migration.” But we don’t need to manage illegal migration—We Need to Shut it Down Completely.— Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) June 14, 2022However, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) made additional efforts to protect his state from Biden’s immigration crisis. On Friday, he directly addressed the issue announcing his petition to the Florida Supreme Court to create a statewide grand jury to investigate human smuggling networks.“The purpose of the grand jury will be to investigate individuals and organizations that are actively working with foreign nationals, drug cartels, coyotes to illegally smuggle minors, some as young as two-years-old across the border and into Florida,” DeSantis explained. “This is just wrong what they’re doing and we are going to go after it. The grand jury will also investigate the methods that these smugglers use to transport so-called unaccompanied alien children across the southern border and any criminal activity that is associated with these operations.”Among his other initiatives is to sign a bill that penalizes contractors hired by the federal government that transports unauthorized immigrants to Florida.In Florida, we are taking action to protect our state from Biden's Border Crisis. pic.twitter.com/bd6LAAWNYn— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 17, 2022In Biden’s fiscal year of 2021 alone, the Customs and Border Protection reported 1.7 million encounters with illegal migrants at the southern border, which is the highest number ever recorded in a single year.

(Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:53 PM PT – Monday, June 20 2022The messaging seems to be clear among economists within the Biden administration: don’t say recession. They appear to be reluctant to say a recession is looming, despite warning the economy is likely to slow down.Several of Biden’s economists were scattered around on several corporate news outlets, where they asserted inflation will likely “not come down to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target” and the US economy will “slow down” yet a recession is “not inevitable.”Together, we've made extraordinary progress in laying a new foundation for our economy. But there's still so much at stake. pic.twitter.com/0hcrgpdTGs— President Biden (@POTUS) June 20, 2022President of the Cleveland Fed, Loretta Mester said she agreed with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that the Central Bank cannot do much more than it already has done. Powell announced last week that the Fed is going to hike the interest rate by 75 basis points, which is 50 percent more than they originally planned.Mester asserted, this will aim to moderate demand for goods and services, so that it can get back in balance with the supply side of the economy. However, she went on to blame external factors for high prices of gas, while pointing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“Of course there are other things going on as well,” said Mester. The Ukraine situation which is a tragedy has really led to the prices. Other things were moving on the supply side as well. No doubt, supply conditions remain constrained longer than I think anyone thought.”Meanwhile, Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen echoed the administration’s talking point that the economy under Biden was booming until it suddenly went bust. Yellen claimed the labor market is the strongest in decades, despite record number of people quitting their jobs. She also blamed Russia for America’s high energy and food prices. She stressed, the only way to manage the economic crises is to submit to Biden’s climate agenda.“I think that producers were partly caught unaware by the strength of the recovery in the economy and weren’t ready to meet the needs of the economy,” Yellen expressed. “High prices should induce them to increase supplies over time and look at some medium term matter. The way in which we can assure reasonable energy expenses for household is to move to renewables, to address climate change. That’s the way to free us from GO political movements and gas prices.”Additionally, Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese downplayed the negative impacts of Biden’s economic policies. He noted the long discredited practice of calling the sky high inflation rates as “transitory” and also tried to say there are immensely positive things Biden has done.“We need to navigate through this transition in a way that gets us to stable growth without giving up on all the economic gains that we’ve made,” expressed Deese.However, former the US Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, said a recession is in fact on the horizon. Many experts have credited Summers as one of the most prophetic critics who accurately predicted the economic crises coming into fruition. He asserted that record inflation, food and energy prices are all signs that point to a recession. The former top economist said there are several things the government can do to pullout of the economic crisis.“If at long last we can have some kind of bipartisan budget bill with three elements,” stated Summers. “Reduction of pharmaceutical prices put in place, the partial repeal of the Trump tax cuts and more energy supply approach.” In the meantime, the Fed is gearing up to unleash another massive interest rate hike if the inflation rate that will continue to soar. Critics of the Biden administration have urged officials to stop playing the blame game and work towards fixing their mistakes.Several polls have shown American voters are looking to make a change in the midterm elections.

And let’s be clear, elected officials shouldn’t get in the way and make it more difficult for parents who want their children to be vaccinated.”Biden’s remark was a thinly veiled jab at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) who has expressly said his state has no plan to distribute vaccines to children under the age of five.Gov.

When asked why, Biden warned the next plague may be just around the horizon.“But we don’t just need more money for vaccines for children eventually, we need more money to plan for the second pandemic,” he asserted. “There’s going to be another pandemic, we have to think ahead. And that’s not something the last outfit did very well, that’s something we’ve been doing fairly well. That’s why we need the money.”The next most prevalent virus in the news cycle, Monkeypox, has had less than 3,000 reported cases worldwide since early May.","A vial of a children’s dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine sits in the foreground as children play in a hospital room waiting to be able to receive the vaccine at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut on November 2, 2021.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:35 AM PT – Wednesday, June 22 2022US Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen recently appeared to shift the responsibility of dealing with inflation away from the White House. While speaking to reporters on Monday, she claimed the Federal Reserve is responsible for dealing with the American economy.Her statements came after the organization announced an interest rate hike in attempt to address inflation. Prior to this, Yellen suggested the Biden administration was running out of options to address its mishandling of the economy.“The primary role for addressing inflation rests with the Federal Reserve,” she noted. “That said, the President, President Biden would be supportive of some complimentary fiscal actions that would supplement and support what the Fed is doing.”Additionally, she took aim at 45th President Donald Trump’s economic plan by labeling it as a failed strategy, which did not boost private investments. Her remarks came in spite of economists saying his tax plan increased business investments by over 10 percent with corporate investments being boosted by 15 percent.“We had very large tax cuts, corporate tax cuts, in the United States in 2017 intended to boost private investment,” said Yellen. “They didn’t succeed in boosting private investment at all and I think if you look at the history, this has simply not been a lot to boost growth in the United States.”Joe Biden has failed to address any of the crises he created for the American people.From inflation, supply chain shortages, and higher gas across the country – Biden has failed.— GOP (@GOP) June 21, 2022Meanwhile, President Joe Biden found another target to blame rising inflation on during his vacation in Delaware.“We also can move in the direction that we can provide for increasing the tax, taxes on those in the corporate area as well as individuals as it relates to Trump’s tax cut, which is inflationary,” stated the President. “Going out and buying a yacht doesn’t help the economy a whole lot.”In the meantime, Biden remains in denial about his mishandling of the economy with economists raising concerns about a possible recession.","Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee during a hearing on proposed fiscal year 2023 budget on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday , June 8, 2022.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:19 AM PT – Wednesday, June 22 2022GOP representatives welcomed newly elected Texas Republican Mayra Flores with open arms. In a ceremony held on Tuesday, Flores was sworn in with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) making the historical announcement.Flores made history by becoming the first Mexican-born woman to hold a seat in Congress. This came one week after she won a special election with over 51 percent of the vote for Texas’s 34th District, which predominantly leaned Democrat up until her historic victory.“Nothing’s greater than the American story, nothing is greater than Myra Flores’s story,” said McCarthy. “It’s not just that she was born in Mexico. It’s not just what she was able to achieve, but think about the seat in which she won. It is a seat that the Republican Party has not had in more than 100 years of the Rio Grande Valley.”Join me in welcoming the newest Republican to Congress—along with her Border Patrol husband and four kids—Mayra Flores! pic.twitter.com/i78byyUKTS— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) June 22, 2022Flores, who is the daughter of a GOP organizer, had the following message for Democrat politicians.“I was born in Burgos, Tamaulipas, Mexico, raised with strong values to always put God and family first, ” she stated. “My father, Saul Flores, moved us to the United States because of the promise of America, he told me. In this country, if you work hard, you can accomplish anything. My story proves he is right. But right now, our people are struggling. They are taken for granted. That ends now.”She believes her story can inspire others to achieve the American dream despite the current rhetoric surrounding so-called white privilege.“I am a proud Border Patrol wife and a mother fighting for a better future for our children,” Flores continued. “I want to inspire every child that today is working in the fields — strawberry, onions, cotton field and you name it — I want you to know that you can become a congressman, a congresswoman if you work hard.”Flores will fill the vacated seat until January, but is set to square off against Democrat Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in the general election in November.","In this Wednesday, Sept. 22, 2021, photo Republican congressional candidate Mayra Flores attends a Cameron County Conservatives event in Harlingen, Texas.
