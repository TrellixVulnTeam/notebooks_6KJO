2022-08-08,Updated 12:20 PM PT,Rep. Meijer slams DCCC for meddling in GOP primary,"Rep. Peter Meijer (R-Mich.) recently slammed Democrats over their meddling in the state’s Republican primary. During an interview on Sunday, Meijer claimed the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) united with Republicans to get challenger, John Gibbs, across the finish line.The committee spent $325,000 on an ad promoting Gibbs. Meijer claimed the DCCC’s involvement was due to the committee wanting to boost a Republican they think will be easier to defeat in the general elections in November.Meijer thinks it’s problematic that today’s political climate awards personality.“This is a risky strategy. It’s a dangerous strategy,” he said. “Where President Biden is in his approval is so in the gutter that it is easy to see that strategy backfiring in a spectacular way which is all the more reason why we should not be embracing the zero sum idea of politics.”The congressman was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach 45th President Donald Trump the second time.","In this July 25, 2022 photo, Michigan’s 3rd District Congressional Republican Rep.

On Sunday, over two inches of rain fell in the span of an hour and caused flash floods across the area. Flooding hit the highways especially hard with interstate 70 being forced to close in both directions for part of the evening.Flash Flood Warning continues for Denver CO, Aurora CO and  Commerce City CO until 10:15 PM MDT pic.twitter.com/9Z3snRHvLe— NWS Boulder (@NWSBoulder) August 8, 2022Matt Sanman, a spokesperson for Kiewit, the lead contractor on the project, said an error is believed to have caused the pumps not to turn on automatically. Once a superintendent noticed the flooding near I-70 and York Street, they turned the pumps on manually, which started draining the water.In chest deep water – Denver firefighters rescued multiple children, including a baby, stuck in flood waters.Man who gave me this video (Felix Espinoza) says this was at 38th and Blake.

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:09 AM PT – Monday, August 8, 2022Billionaire Bill Gates is actively promoting the new Democrat-proposed spending bill due to its “climate change” provisions. In an op-ed for the New York Times, Gates claimed the so-called Inflation Reduction Act could be the most important piece of “climate legislation” in American history.The Microsoft founder argued that the bill would create an “energy future that is cleaner, cheaper and more secure.” Gates also said making solar panels and wind turbines is very important. The Democrat bill would finance that. According to reports, Gates aggressively lobbied in favor of that bill, resulting in Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) changing his mind to support the legislation.On the contrary, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said the Inflation Reduction Act is a “war on Medicare.” In an interview Sunday, he voiced strong opposition to cutting Medicare funds.Democrats’ latest reckless tax & spend spree is a War on Seniors & War on American Jobs. It cuts Medicare, raises taxes & pours gas on @JoeBiden’s raging inflation.I won’t stop fighting against Democrats’ socialist agenda that’s destroying our country.https://t.co/TzvUBml4Vn— Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) August 7, 2022The Florida lawmaker said that a $280 billion anticipated Medicare expenditure will not be spent, impacting research done by drug companies who provide life-saving drugs to seniors. Scott’s comments came just before Vice President Kamala Harris broke the tie in the Senate, pushing the legislation through the upper chamber.Meanwhile, the 45th President slammed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) while asserting he has been manipulated by the Democrats.  In a post on Truth Social Sunday, Trump accused McConnell of caving to the Democrats on the infrastructure bill, compromising on the Second Amendment and not using the debt ceiling for negotiations.“Mitch McConnell got played like a fiddle with the vote today by the Senate Democrats. First he gave them the fake Infrastructure Bill, then Guns, never used the Debt Ceiling for negotiating purposes (gave it away for NOTHING!), and now this. Mitch doesn’t have a clue – he is sooo bad for the Republican Party!”— Donald Trump via Truth SocialWhile at CPAC, Trump said McConnell compromises with Sen. Manchin too much, which led to Republicans suffering since the West Virginia Democrat voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. The former President said, “Mitch doesn’t have a clue.”President Joe Biden praised the bills passing in the Senate. He released his statement on the legislation on Sunday, just one day after its passage.Statement by President Biden on Senate passage of the Inflation Reduction Act: pic.twitter.com/Dstk783CNy— The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 7, 2022Before the vote, Biden touted the bill as a means to combat inflation, despite many economists saying it would do the opposite.

Bill Richardson optimistic Griner will returnIn this Jan. 24, 2018, file photo, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson gives an interview in Yangon, Myanmar. (Thet Htoo/AP Photo)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:33 AM PT – Monday, August 8, 2022President Joe Biden’s de-facto hostage rescue envoy, former New Mexico Governor and UN Ambassador Bill Richardson, has high hopes for diplomats to secure the return of WNBA star Brittney Griner. While speaking with ABC News Sunday, Richardson maintained all sides are working diligently to secure a prisoner swap to get Griner back to America, along with US Marine Paul Whelan who’s been imprisoned in Russia since 2018.Richardson also said he’s been acting as mediator between the Biden administration, Russia and other countries that detained Americans while citing his experience and contacts as reason the ball is moving forward.“Through my experience, for instance, Foreign Minister Lavrov, he and I were ambassadors together at the same and I’m pleased that he’s pragmatic, that he’s sort of in charge and sent a good signal,” Richardson stated. “I think the negotiations are going to be undertaken and my view is that I’m optimistic. I think she’s going to be freed.”The former Clinton-era diplomat went on to commend the Biden administration for actually “doing something” to get Americans back after families of those detained abroad criticized Biden’s response late last year. Richardson added, there should be only one mission Biden should be focused on: getting Americans back on American soil.“We have to bring American hostages home, especially those wrongfully detained, especially those who have served in our military,” he stressed. “So look, they’re not perfect, but I commend the President for considering it.”Meanwhile, critics are speaking out against the Biden administration’s efforts while pointing to officials’ hypocrisy. Griner was arrested and later convicted for having hashish oil on her at a Russian airport. Top officials, including Biden, Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, rushed to decry Russia’s actions as heinous.However, some critics, including former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, lamented there are people in the US who are facing imprisonment for similar crimes who are not receiving that much attention. Gabbard also reiterated, many officials put those Americans behind bars, namely her arch nemesis Kamala Harris.“And to me, the message to the American people through their actions is loud and clear: if you are rich and powerful or famous then you will get special treatment from this administration,” she noted. “If you are not, we don’t care about you. We’re gonna sit and let you rot in jail.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was publicly derided by federal regulators and the mainstream media for smoking weed on the Joe Rogan experience, echoed a similar sentiment.“I was like, man if the President is working so hard to sort of free someone who’s in jail in Russia for some weed then shouldn’t we free people in America?” he asked open-endedly.In the meantime, Ambassador Richardson warned instances of Americans being detained overseas has gone up in recent years. This has prompted President Biden and his State Department to bolster protocols combating efforts to imprison Americans, including warning citizens of countries that are targeting Americans like Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.","In this Jan. 24, 2018, file photo, former New Mexico Gov.

There is nothing more important she will ever do than lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office and she will succeed.”The campaign ad is not likely to swing Wyoming voters in her favor as Trump won nearly 70 percent of the vote in 2020 and the state’s GOP voted to censure Rep.

(AP Photo/Arleigh Rodgers)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:30 PM PT – Sunday, August 7, 2022Indiana lawmakers move forward with a pro-life law in light of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. On Friday, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb signed a near-total abortion ban into law during the final day of the state legislature’s two-week special session.The law grants exceptions for the procedure for cases of incest and rape before 10 weeks post-fertilization. This only if giving birth harms the mother and if the fetus shows signs of a deadly illness. This brought on the ire of Democrats and other abortion activists with the White House calling the move “devastating” and continuing to call the US Supreme Court extremist.“Following the overturning of Roe, I stated clearly that I would be willing to support legislation that made progress in protecting life,” Holcomb said. “In my view, SEA 1 accomplishes this goal following its passage in both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly with a solid majority of support.”On Thursday, the Indiana House rejected Republican-sponsored amendments that would have removed the exceptions for rape, incest and fatal fetal anomalies from the bill. Members of House Republican leadership were divided as Speaker Todd Huston and Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Karickhoff voted against the amendments, while Majority Leader Matt Lehman backed the amendments.Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban yesterday.

This is an absolutely shameful decision made by the Indiana legislature and governor.— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) August 6, 2022White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre slammed the new law in a statement Saturday, calling the bill’s passage “another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women’s reproductive rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.”#NEW: Eli Lilly, one of Indiana’s largest employers and headquartered in Indianapolis, says because of the near-total abortion ban just passed in the state it will be “forced to plan for more employment growth outside of our home state.”#AbortionBan pic.twitter.com/tlIngH6JOt— Max Lewis (@MaxLewisTV) August 6, 2022Indiana is the first state to approve an abortion ban after the landmark Dobbs decision.

(The Moab Police Department via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, August 8, 2022Nearly a year after Gabby Petito’s interaction with Moab Police, her family files a $50 million wrongful death suit. Lawyers for the family outlined the plans Monday and said they are suing the Moab Utah Police for negligence of the law and how to enforce it. They said their goal is to hold government entities accountable and raise awareness of intimate partner violence and its dangers. Gabby first interacted with Moab Police on August 12, 2020 when they responded to a domestic dispute call.The parents of Gabby Petito have filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against the Moab Utah Police Department.

Family members added they want to prevent further tragedies. The lawyers didn’t share specific evidence but said the FBI uncovered extensive information during the search for Gabby.Petito was 22 when she was reported missing in September 2021. She was on a months-long cross country trip living in a van with Laundrie. Petito’s body was found in Bridger Teton National Forest in Wyoming on September 19, 2021. It was determined she had been dead for at least three weeks when she was found. Laundrie was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Florida’s Carlton Reserve in October 2021. He admitted to killing Petito in writings that were found after his death, officials have said.The suit will center on a police encounter with Petito and Laundrie on August 12, 2021, during their trip in Utah, shortly before her death. That interaction made headlines following Petito’s disappearance, with body camera footage released showing Petito visibly distraught. According to the police report, Petito told officers she had slapped Laundrie and hit him first and that he had grabbed her face. But ultimately, both Petito and Laundrie said that they did not want to press charges and that they loved each other.“While the full evidence has not yet been made public, when it is released, it will clearly show that if the officers had been properly trained and followed the law, Gabby would still be alive today,” James McConkie, another of the family’s attorneys, said in the press release. “Failure to follow the law can have deadly consequences, as it did in this case.”The department has 60 days to respond to the suit.","FILE – This police camera video provided by The Moab Police Department shows Gabrielle “Gabby” Petito talking to a police officer after police pulled over the van she was traveling in with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, near the entrance to Arches National Park on Aug. 12, 2021.

2022-08-08,11:25 AM PT,Poll: 56% of Americans say personal finances worse under Biden,"Poll: 56% of Americans say personal finances worse under BidenOAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:25 AM PT – Monday, August 8, 2022A rising number of Americans are saying their personal finances are getting worse under the current administration. A new Harvard-Harris poll found a majority of 56 percent of Americans said their financial situation has worsened amid President Joe Biden’s policies.This compared to just 33 percent of respondents saying the same a year ago. In addition, only 20 percent of Americans complained about a poor economy in the final month of 45th President Donald Trump’s presidency. This comes as rents and mortgage costs are surging across the US, along with an ongoing rise in other basic living expenses.“Many tenants saw decided decreases in their income during the pandemic, so we’re in an unfortunate situation where inflation may allow landlords to increase rent just at a time when when tenants can’t really afford it at all,” explained Cynthia Strathmnann of Strategic Actions for A Just EconomyA separate poll by Rasmussen revealed the majority of Americans believe the US is in a recession and Biden is to blame. This comes as the Biden administration appears to have paired up with Big Business to promote its latest social spending bill. The President said a Democrat-backed spending binge will combat inflation, however, hundreds of economists disagree.Last week, the President held a virtual conference with representatives of large businesses and labor unions to promote his so-called Inflation Reduction Act. He claimed the mega corporations had American families’ best interests at heart by putting their weight behind the bill. Biden touted the multiple ways he alleged Americans will save money from health care to effects from the so-called climate crisis.However, analysts are less optimistic about the bill with 230 economists penning a letter to House and Senate leadership warning the spending package will serve as gasoline for red hot inflation. The economists warned the spending tax hikes will serve as a one-two punch to the economy, boosting demand while handicapping supply.Nonetheless, the Inflation Reduction Act passed in the Senate over the weekend. The legislation will move to the House with a vote expected to take place on Friday. Meanwhile, several GOP lawmakers are calling attention to flaws in the bill.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Battle For The Future: The Inflation Reduction ActTOPICS:Cynthia StrathmnannDonald TrumpECONOMYfinancefinancesinflationJoe Bidenliving costsMortgagenewsOANOANNpollpoltiicsRasmussenRECESSIONrentspending SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/poll-56-of-americans-say-personal-finances-worse-under-biden/

Biden also suggested its passage will help Democrats in the midterms.“A whole range of things that are really game changers for ordinary folks,” he said.  “Now, some of it’s not going to kick in for a little bit. But it’s all good..when you sit down (at) that kitchen table the end of the month, they will be able pay a whole lot more bills because they are paying less.”The legislation will move to the House with a vote expected to take place on Friday.","FILE – President Joe Biden walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on his way to his Rehoboth Beach, Del., home, Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022.

During an interview on Sunday, Meijer claimed the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) united with Republicans to get challenger, John Gibbs, across the finish line.The committee spent $325,000 on an ad promoting Gibbs. Meijer claimed the DCCC’s involvement was due to the committee wanting to boost a Republican they think will be easier to defeat in the general elections in November.Meijer thinks it’s problematic that today’s political climate awards personality.“This is a risky strategy. It’s a dangerous strategy,” he said. “Where President Biden is in his approval is so in the gutter that it is easy to see that strategy backfiring in a spectacular way which is all the more reason why we should not be embracing the zero sum idea of politics.”The congressman was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach 45th President Donald Trump the second time.","In this July 25, 2022 photo, Michigan’s 3rd District Congressional Republican Rep.
