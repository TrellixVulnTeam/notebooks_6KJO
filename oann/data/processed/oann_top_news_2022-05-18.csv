Five others were injured.“Dr. Cheng is a hero in this incident,” Barnes stated.The Sheriff said due to the quick actions of several elderly churchgoers who tackled the shooter and hog tied him with an electrical cord, the number of casualties was lessened.Chou is being charged with one felony count of first degree murder and five felony counts of attempted murder.#OCSDPIO The suspect in the Laguna Woods church shooting has been identified as David Chou, 68 years old, of Las Vegas, NV.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:08 PM PT – Monday, May 16, 2022Republican governors across the country are increasingly expressing excitement at the likely prospect the Supreme Court will overturn the landmark case Roe v. Wade.On Sunday, Oklahoma’s Republican Governor Kevin Stitt said that he was excited for the state to enforce its fetal heartbeat law, which bans all abortions after a heartbeat can be detected. This usually occurs around six weeks into pregnancy.“I represent 4 million Oklahomans,” said Stitt. “We believe life begins at conception and we’re going to protect life in Oklahoma. There were 5,000  just in Oklahoma alone. Five-thousand unborn children that were killed last year and we don’t believe in that in Oklahoma. Other states can do things differently.”Oklahoma abortion law wont be able to be enforced everywhere in the state. Much of the state is controlled by sovereign Native American tribes who can set their own rules for their territory.“The tribes in Oklahoma are super liberal,” Stitt expressed. “We think that there’s the possibility that some tribes may try to set up abortion on demand.”He was sparse on the details of what he wants to do, but he did say he wants protection for “pre-born babies” to be strengthened as much as possible. There is no exception for rape or incest in the law.I am proud to sign SB 1503, the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act into law.I want Oklahoma to be the most pro-life state in the country because I represent all four million Oklahomans who overwhelmingly want to protect the unborn. pic.twitter.com/XQr7khRLRa— Governor Kevin Stitt (@GovStitt) May 3, 2022The court is expected to release its official opinion before the end of June.","Oklahoma Gov.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:58 AM PT – Monday, May 16, 2022President Joe Biden is set to travel to Buffalo, New York in the wake of the deadly supermarket shooting. The White House released a statement over the weekend, which announced Biden and the First Lady will visit the city on Tuesday to grieve with the mourning community.Jill and I pray for the victims, their families and devastated community from yesterday’s mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. Our hearts are heavy once again but our resolve must not waver; we must work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of this nation.— President Biden (@POTUS) May 15, 2022Biden addressed the shooting on Sunday and assured the Justice Department is investigating the incident as a hate crime. He also praised the actions of law enforcement and offered condolences to the victims as well as their families. Ten people lost their lives during the attack.  He also called on Americans to do everything in their power to end “hate-fueled domestic terrorism.”Meanwhile, New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) said CEOs of social media companies should be held accountable for certain crimes. During an interview Sunday, the Democrat said these chief executives need to assure the public that they are taking every step possible to monitor risky information.Her remarks came after the suspected shooter reportedly posted a 180 page manifesto online, just one day before opening fire at the Buffalo supermarket. The act of violence left 10 people dead while the attack was live streamed for an online audience to witness.“Well this manifesto tells everything to us and that is what is so bone-chiling about it,” stated the governor. “There is the ability for people to write and subscribe to such philosophies filled with hate and white supremacist acts of terrorism that are being fermented on social media, and to know that what this one individual did has been shared with the rest of the world.”Hochul said violent hate messages need to be monitored and shut down the moment they are exposed. Meanwhile, the suspected gunman from the Buffalo shooting has been charged. One America’s Taylor Tinsley has more.","A person pays his respects outside the scene of a shooting at a supermarket, in Buffalo, N.Y., Sunday, May 15, 2022.

Rick Scott (R-Fla.) warned cooperating with the World Health Organization may erode US national sovereignty. In a recent tweet, he noted that the WHO served as a political “puppet” to the Communist regime in China and suggested it helped cover up the origins of COVID.The @WHO has served as a puppet for the Chinese Communist Party & helped Communist China cover up info on COVID-19. The Biden admin must NOT give this sham of a health agency national sovereignty over the U.S. & control over Americans' lives & health. https://t.co/mt4NtgOyxx— Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) May 14, 2022The Floridian then voiced, the WHO’s health advice has been discredited and the organization itself is a “sham” health agency. Sen. Scott consequently added, the organization must not have control over the health and lives of Americans.“The Biden administration wants to control through fear and mandate, so the government is touching every part of your life,” said Scott. “I wont stand for it, Americans wont stand for it. They know that the order is an over reach of power. The nation should be free to make choices that they feel are in their best interests for their own health and of loved ones.”Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) echoed his colleagues remarks while also taking to Twitter recently. The Arkansas Republican called the health agency “corrupt,” while asserting it’s controlled by Chinese Communist Party.The World Health Organization is corrupt and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. The last thing the Biden Administration should do is give the @WHO authority over Americans.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) May 16, 2022The concern from GOP lawmakers comes as the World Health Assembly moves to create a global accord on pandemic response, which includes both prevention measures and preparedness actions. This would establish an intergovernmental negotiating body that would ultimately decide what measures are “deemed appropriate.”Both Republican lawmakers urged against the Biden administration allowing WHO to have authority over Americans, especially with such a strong Chinese influence. This comes as the world’s second largest economy has continued to falter due to an ongoing zero-COVID lockdown strategy.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:45 PM PT – Monday, May 16, 2022The Golden State is moving forward with a bill that undermines families medical decisions. The California bill allows children from ages 12 to 17 to receive different forms of healthcare without parental consent.The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee at the beginning of May and recently passed the Senate Health Committee. The vote was 21-7 with Sen. Ben Hueso (D-Calif.) and Melissa Hurtado (D-Calif.) voting ‘no.’The authors of SB-871 and SB-866, Scott Weiner (D-Calif.) and Dr. Richard Pan, are known for authoring radical vaccine bills.Mother and founder of the San Diego-based grassroots coalition Let them Breathe, Sharon Mckeeman noted the possibility of the bill being passed.“If this were to pass, there is going to be a mass exit from the public school system,” said McKeeman. “We are seeing that families are outraged and concerned that this responsibility is being put on their children’s shoulders. All this decision making, instead of staying in the family unit…especially during a time of uncertainty.” Golden State parent advocates have been fighting against these mandates in public schools and are concerned about the California Legislature undermining the family unit.Given that Democrats hold a veto-proof majority in both chambers and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) doesn’t have any issues proposing vaccine mandates, it’s a possibility the Golden State could see this bill come to fruition.Despite this, San Diego-based attorney and father, Scott Davison believes there is a path moving forward and “still hope for California.” “We really need these parents to speak out and get more involved with their school system, so that this doesn’t become a reality that we just push off into the future,” concluded Davison. The next step is for the California State Assembly to vote on the bill and for Gov. Newsom (D-Calif.) to veto the bill or sign it into law.","State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, addresses the state Senate at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif., Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022.

The Goldman Sachs executive added, elevated inflation may persist for a long time, which may worsen quality of life for millions of Americans.“Some of the supply chain shocks will go away, but some of it will be a little bit stickier and will be with us for a while,” he explained. “And while we’re talking about this in the macro sense, overall for individuals and certainly the individuals at the bottom quartile of the pie sharing, it’s going to be quite difficult and oppressive.”Blankfein went on to say he believes the US financial system will get through this crisis and risks will reduce after the Ukraine crisis is over. Meanwhile, economist Robin Woods, a former Chief FX Strategist at Goldman Sachs, echoed  Blankfein’s warning while suggesting a global recession is coming.Global recession is coming.

In an interview Sunday, the former First Lady pointed out that a lot of people are struggling and suffering from problems both in the US as well as abroad.“It’s heartbreaking to see that they (Americans) are struggling and the food is not available for children in (the) 21st Century in the United States of America,” she noted. “What’s going on, it’s unthinkable. A lot of people are dying from drugs and it’s very sad to see.”Her remarks came after recent economic data put Americans on edge after the inflation report for April showed it increased 8.3 percent from a year ago. Last week, Biden spoke about the state of the economy while blaming everyone and everything but his own administration.

The poll found people of older generations and women support joining NATO the most, while young Swedish men are the least supportive of the proposal.“I think that it put our security in jeopardy and then we’re also allying ourselves with less nice and trustworthy countries,” said Olof Bjork, a court employee in Stockholm. “We could increase other cooperation, military cooperation, and increase our own ability to defend ourselves, invest in a national conscription defense.”This comes as the Swedish ruling party abandoned its 73-year long opposition to NATO and voted to join the alliance in recent days.

McConnell said Sunday that Finland and Sweden would be “important additions” to NATO as he led a delegation of GOP senators to the region in a show of support against Russia’s aggression. (Anders Wiklund/TT News Agency via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:14 AM PT – Tuesday, May 17, 2022The Senate has advanced the $40 billion aid package for Ukraine. In an 81-to-11 vote Monday, the upper chamber overwhelmingly moved to put the measure to a final vote. The 11 senators who voted ‘no,’ including Tennessee Republican Bill Hagerty, expressed concerns of putting the war in Ukraine above American interests.The measure easily passed in the House, but was single handedly stalled in the upper chamber by Kentucky Sen, Rand Paul last week. The Republican said lawmakers must install a special inspector general to oversee how the Ukraine military aid is spent. Paul explained that his oath of office “is to the national security of the United States of America.”“The US is trying to recover from the $1.6 trillion we spent on wars in the Middle East,” he stated. “Not to mention the $5 trillion borrowed for COVID. We should not forget that the Soviet Union collapsed in large part, not because it was defeated militarily, but because it ran out of money.”The lower chamber had passed the legislation in a 368-to-57 vote last week, just hours after the bill’s official text was released. All 57 opponents of the spending spree were Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) praised the bill’s passing as a monumental for a crisis that has raged for the past three months.“We should all be very proud that we had the opportunity when (Vladimir) Putin decided whatever it is he decided, to be brutal and cruel and a coward, that we were there to help,” stated the top Democrat. “It’s about democracy versus a dictatorship.”The aid is supposedly split evenly between military and humanitarian efforts with billions of dollars going towards training Ukrainian troops, replenishing weapons stores, propping up the Ukrainian economy and aiding refugees in the US.The bill is $7 billion more than President Joe Biden’s initial request and will put the American aid to Ukraine up to $54 billion since the war first began. With its passing, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) claimed the latest push will bring the crisis closer to a conclusion.“This bill ensures that we are one step closer to making them pay the full price for their actions,” she stated. “And in the process, we will be standing firmly with the Ukrainian people while combating the exploitation of Ukraine’s vulnerable financial system.”Biden and the Democrat Party initially wanted to tie the package in with additional funding to combat COVID. However, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-K.Y.) had pledged to stand in the way of the bill’s passage unless COVID relief funds were dropped.I got to meet with Ukrainian Ambassador Markarova to discuss Ukraine's brave fight.

On Tuesday, top Pentagon officials said the number of UAPs, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, reported by pilots and service members had grown to about 400 incidents. This is up from 143 from just a year ago.The UFO hearing this morning was a total joke. We should have heard from people who could talk about things they'd personally seen, but instead the witnesses were government officials with limited knowledge who couldn't give real answers to serious questions. pic.twitter.com/hddRYupW3u— Rep. Tim Burchett (@RepTimBurchett) May 17, 2022Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, Ronald S. Moultrie said transparency was important. He also said the goal was to find out what’s out there, in addition to keeping US military and bases safe.“We know that our service members have encountered unidentified aerial phenomenon,” Moultrie stated. “And because UAPs pose potential flight safety and general security risks, we are committed to a focused effort to determine their origins.”Other Pentagon officials stressed, the UAPs found do not appear to be of extraterrestrial origin.Full resolution of metallic UAP/UFO cockpit video shown publicly in today’s congressional hearing.

Biden gave the award to the 2020 and 2021 classes after the COVID-19 pandemic postponed both ceremonies.The Medal of Valor is the highest honor a public safety officer can receive for performing acts of heroism.“Today is an important day for the nation to give thanks for all that you do for everybody, for all of us,” Biden said. “Because of COVID-19 we couldn’t have this special ceremony for the past two years, but I’m honored that we finally can today. Fifteen public safety officers from eight different departments with a Medal of Valor, the highest award a president can bestow on a public safety officer.”The recipients of the award included nine police officers and six fire fighters. One recipient was a North Carolina police officer who tragically passed away after saving a woman during a hostage situation in a busy retail area.“You’re the heart and soul and the very spine, very spine of this country and your communities,” he proclaimed. “Each one of you from small town departments to big cities, you’re cut from the same cloth. You possess a selflessness that’s really hard to explain. A rare commitment to your neighbors and your fellow Americans, an unusual bravery that inspires everyone and you’ve been singled out because of your extraordinary heroism.”Today, I awarded the Medal of Valor to 15 public safety officers – including two who died in the line of duty. These heroes represent the best of who we are as Americans – and these medals reflect the profound gratitude of our nation. pic.twitter.com/4DS4VNb7tL— President Biden (@POTUS) May 17, 2022Biden ended the ceremony by paying tribute to a retired Buffalo police officer who was killed during a mass shooting incident, which left 10 people dead and three others injured.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:19 AM PT – Tuesday, May 17, 2022A severe outbreak of bird flu has continued to hit bird farms across the nation. On Monday, Pennsylvania reported the thirteenth farm in the state had been affected by the outbreak, which has now hit over 4 million birds in the Keystone State alone.In Iowa, a turkey farmer described the outbreak as extremely severe. He said it’s worse than a similar outbreak in 2015 because despite having to kill two-thirds of the birds back then, he didn’t really know what was happening. However, now he knows exactly how it will play out. The farmer said he doesn’t think humans are in danger because of the outbreak.“I don’t think it’s a human threat because a lot of people don’t have the chickens and stuff inside their house or anything like that,” explained farmer rad Moline. “They are outside or they’re out in well ventilated barns and stuff, so I think the human threat is very, very low.”Unfortunately, when commercial breaks occur, it impacts more birds than in the backyard flocks. As of May 13, 628,300 commercial poultry have been lost this month to #birdflu, as opposed to 1,892 birds in backyard flocks. According to data collected by @APHIS_USDA.— Corey Munson (@CMunson_News) May 17, 2022According to the USDA, the latest bird flu outbreak has affected over 37 million birds across 34 states.","FILE – In this Oct. 21, 2015, file photo, cage-free chickens walk in a fenced pasture at an organic farm near Waukon, Iowa.
