The former “19 Kids and Counting” star was arrested last year after federal authorities found child porn files were being downloaded on his computer.Duggar faced up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 for each count. He was fined $10,000 and is required to enter a sex offense treatment program.“While this is not the sentence we asked for, this is a lengthy sentence,” US Attorney David Clay Fowlkes said.According to legal documents the 34-year-old received his sentence from an Arkansas judge on Wednesday. When Duggar was convicted in December, his parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar shared a statement on their website calling the situation “very grievous.”“In the days ahead we will do all we can to surround our daughter-in-law Anna and their children with love and support,” his parents stated. “As parents we will never stop praying for Joshua and loving him as we do all of our children.” Duggar, whose lawyers sought a five year sentence, maintains his innocence and has said he will appeal.“We’re grateful the judge dismissed Count two and rejected the government’s request for a 240 month sentence,” Duggar’s lawyer Justin K. Gelfand voiced. “We look forward to continuing the fight on appeal.”Attorney Fowlkes announced he is pleased with the verdict.","This undated photo provided by Washington County (Ark), Detention Center shows Josh Duggar.

Alderpeople passed the curfew in a 30-19 vote as an increase in shootings plague Downtown and following the killing of 16-year-0ld Seandell Holliday near The Bean at Millennium Park.“As a city, we must ensure that our young people have safe spaces to congregate and that in those spaces they are peaceful and actually safe,” Lightfoot said in a statement. “I am calling on all parents, guardians, and caring adults to step up at this moment and do whatever it takes to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again and to encourage appropriate behavior when our young people gather anywhere in this great city of ours. We all must model and enforce the respect and peace we expect from our young people.”City Council members passed the law on Wednesday, which will require all minors 17-years of age and younger to be home by 10 p.m. The previous curfew only applied to minors aged 16-years and younger.Protect children, not gun laws.— Lori Lightfoot (@LoriLightfoot) May 25, 2022The Democrat mayor claimed the curfew would reduce crime that spiraled out of control over the past two years amid calls to defund the police. Lightfoot said a curfew has been on the books in Chicago since 1992. Alderpeople who voted against the curfew asserted that it wont reduce crime.“We’re tweaking what already exists, changing and making it uniform across every single day,” the mayor stated. “It’s not Armageddon and with due respect, it’s offensive and wrong and demonstrably false to say these modest changes are going to increase gun violence.”Lightfoot admitted the shootings are an issue happening all over the city.","Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot speaks during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Obama Presidential Center at Jackson Park on September 28, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois.(Photo by Kamil Krzaczynski / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LORIIII.jpg, House Subcommittee Holds Hearing On Baby Formula CrisisTOPICS:1992alderpeopleCHICAGOcrimecurfewguardiansgun violenceLori LightfootmayornewsOANOANNparentsSAFE SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/chicago-implements-new-curfew-for-teenagers-amid-crime-surge/

The House Energy Oversight Subcommittee recently held a hearing to find a solution. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle asked questions about how the nation got to this point and why the Biden administration is struggling to fix it.“Why did the Biden administration let the shortage become so dire before acting with any urgency?” asked Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.). “I anticipate that we will hear different excuses today and frankly I’m not interested in debating in stock rates or whether babies can switch from one brand to another depending on their health needs.”Representatives from both major parties acknowledged this shortage was preventable, while asserting that the government should have been more prepared.“There were growing strains on the domestic supply of formula in the months leading up to the reported infant illness and the subsequent recall of Abbott products, but the recall itself turned the US formula supply into a tailspin,” said Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.).WATCH LIVE: #SubOversight hearing on infant formula shortages with @US_FDA leaders and executives from Abbott, Gerber and Reckitt →— Energy and Commerce Committee (@EnergyCommerce) May 25, 2022During the hearing, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf outlined the administration’s plan to address shortages moving forward. He said the FDA is looking at potential reform, so a shortage of essential items does not happen again.“My basic plan has been to get through this crisis and then we will be looking at the overall food program from the perspective of reforming it, but not waiting to deal with the specifics of this case,” Califf stated.In the meantime, the FDA reported there’s still not enough safety measures being taken at the Michigan formula plant in order to reopen it. As of now, the administration has claimed it will be ready to open in a few weeks.","Abbott President of US and Canada Nutrition and Senior Vice President Christopher Calamari testifies remotely before a House Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hybrid hearing on ‘Formula Safety and Supply: Protecting the Health of America’s Babies on Wednesday, May 25, 2022 in Washington.

(Dominic Lipinski/PA via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:17 AM PT – Thursday, May 26, 2022A new government report has shed further light on parties held by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his staff during coronavirus lockdowns.According to the report from U.K. Civil Servant Susan Grey on Wednesday, the culture of the prime minister’s cabinet was not up to par and the events that took place “should not have been allowed to happen.” Grey, who investigated 16 incidents between 2020 and 2021, said 83 people violated lockdown rules at the gatherings.“Many will be dismayed that behavior of this kind took place on this scale at the heart of government,” Gray noted. “The public have a right to expect the very highest standards of behavior in such places and clearly what happened fell well short of this.”Meanwhile, Johnson said he bears full responsibility for his actions, but has called on the U.K. to move on from the events.“I overwhelmingly feel it is my job to get on and and deliver,” stated the prime minister. “And and no matter how bitter and painful the conclusions of this may be and they are, and no matter how humbling they are, I’ve got to keep moving forward and the government’s got to keep moving.”The events detailed in Sue Gray’s report were wrong and should never have happened. They’ve been investigated, a full and genuine apology has been given and it’s now time to move on. We must focus on the challenges facing people today.— Oliver Dowden (@OliverDowden) May 25, 2022Johnson, as well as several other government officials, were fined by police for their COVD lockdown violations. According to reports, this is the first time a British prime minster has been found of breaking the law while sitting in office.","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson departs 10 Downing Street, London, Thursday May 26, 2022, the day after the publication of the Sue Gray report into parties in Whitehall during the coronavirus lockdown.

Dorsey was recently accused by his fellow board members of helping Musk advance his $44 billion acquisition offer.Back in April, Twitter’s Board approved the sale of the company to the Tesla CEO. Dorsey seemed to agree with the choice as he voiced that he believed in Musk, tweeting “Elon’s goal of creating a platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is the right one.”Elon’s goal of creating a platform that is “maximally trusted and broadly inclusive” is the right one.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:37 AM PT – Wednesday, May 25, 2022More FBI agents took the stand at the Sussmann trial and confirmed they were led astray from the very start of their investigation into claims of Russia collusion with former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.The link between the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Russia collusion narrative got clearer in day seven of the trial. Taking the limelight in the courtroom was a file titled ‘Crimson Rhino.’ This file was reportedly basis for the investigation into the 2016 campaign and was provided to former top FBI lawyer James Baker from Sussmann.It’s origins come from tech executive Rodney Joffe who was tied to the Hillary Clinton campaign and was a confidential human source for the FBI. He ordered client Jared Novick who ran a data analysis firm to do research on several people tied to then candidate Trump. He also said he felt uncomfortable doing the work because he knew it was opposition research for a political campaign.Meanwhile, a mid-level FBI agent from the Chicago field office Kurt Hydie took the stand. Hydie reportedly wrote a memo that formally kicked off his office’s investigation. He admitted to writing a typographical error when he said the information came from the Department of Justice and not Sussmann. That caused confusion within the FBI where officers thought they were doing research for the federal government not a political actor.“That created a lot of confusion,” Hydie said. “May not have had otherwise.”Berkowitz is talking about this Grasso email showing Joffe called him and provided some info about the Alfa Bank matter.

This includes a possible prosecution of Hillary Clinton herself. The presiding judge of the Sussmann Trial Chris Cooper stressed the proceedings focused solely on Sussmann and whether he lied to the FBI or not.In the meantime, Special Counsel John Durham’s team has one more witness to call Wednesday before turning over the trial to the defense. They could wrap their case as soon as Friday and leave it up to the jurors to decide Sussmann’s fate.","Michael Sussmann, a cybersecurity lawyer who represented the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign in 2016, leaves federal courthouse in Washington, Monday, May 16, 2022.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:27 PM PT – Thursday, May 26, 2022Several Florida residents were honored for their life saving actions to help land a small plane after the pilot suffered a medical emergency.On Thursday, the group was acknowledged by Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center during a news conference. The group included air traffic controllers, medical doctors and passengers of the plane. Pilot Kenneth Allen was able to share his side of the story for the first time.The 64-year-old pilot recalled the moment he lost consciousness while flying ten thousand feet above the Florida coast on May 10, forcing a passenger with no flying experience to take control of the plane.“I remember telling Russ and Daren that I didn’t feel well,” Allen recalled. “My head was pounding and I was seeing little blue lights sparkling through here. They asked me what that means and I said I don’t know, I have a really bad headache. Then I remember them poking me on the side of the arm saying “stay with me, stay with me.” That was it, I can’t really recall anything until my guys over here were pulling me out of the airplane.”After Allen passed out the passenger later identified as Lakeland resident Darren Harrison, can be heard telling the air traffic controller he was not an experienced pilot and that he could tell he was facing the coast.“I’ve got a serious situation here,” Harrison said. “My pilot has gone incoherent. I have no idea how to fly the airplane.”Harrison took control of the plane and managed to land at the Palm Beach International Airport with the help of air traffic control.“I knew if I didn’t react that we would die,” he stated. “I reached over his body because at this point he’s unresponsive. I grabbed the controls of the airplane and slowly started to pull back on the stick and turn.”Both Harrison and the other passenger credited Air Traffic Controller Robert Morgan for safely guiding them to the landing strip. Allen reportedly suffered a torn aorta during the incident, a typically catastrophic injury, which the Doctor’s who treated him asserted could’ve just as easily ended his life.Less than a week after the operation Allen was up and about.","FORT LAUDERDALE, FL – JULY 14: A Delta airlines plane is seen as it comes in for a landing at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on July 14, 2016 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Abortion rights advocates stress that the bans could eliminate access to abortion across the South. The bill does make an exception for rape and incest, or to save the life of the mother.“Right now patients in Oklahoma are being thrown into a state of chaos and fear,” voiced Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. “That chaos will only intensify as surrounding states cut off access as well. We will not stop fighting for the people of Oklahoma and for everyone across the country.”The law would be enforced by private citizens, giving them the ability to sue abortion providers and others who help a woman terminate a pregnancy for up to $10,000. The law is now in effect.","FILE – In this April 12, 2022, file photo, Oklahoma Gov.

Individuals and families should not put their lives at risk by taking the dangerous journey only to be sent back,” stated the secretary.His warning comes as Border Patrol agents are encountering thousands of migrants daily in an ongoing situation partly attributed to the Biden administration’s handling of the southern border. According to Customs and Border Protection data, Border Patrol agents encountered around 234,000 migrants along the southern border in April alone.The United States continues to enforce its immigration laws, and restrictions at our Southwest border have not changed.
