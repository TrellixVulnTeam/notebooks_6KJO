3:00 PM PT",Blinken: Standard of living for Russians is dropping,"US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken addresses the media during a press conference in Berlin, Germany, Friday, June 24, 2022. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn)Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin has not accomplished the goals of his invasion. During an interview Sunday, Blinken said Putin’s goal was to erase Ukraine sovereignty and independence from the map. However, the US official asserted that Putin has already failed.“Let’s not confuse the tactical with strategic,” Blinken said. “When it comes to Putin’s strategic objectives, it’s not working.”Russia’s initial attempt at a surprise attack to seize Kyiv and other areas of Ukraine did not go as planned. In recent weeks, it’s forces have seized cities in Ukraine’s east, including Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk. The adjacent city of Lysychansk is now under intense attack.“We have seen sporadically,” he voiced. “Ever since Putin lost the battle for Kyiv and had to shift his focus just to Eastern and Southern Ukraine, they have occasionally launched missiles at a distance basically to terrorize people.”Blinken’s remarks come out of Germany where G7 leaders announced a ban on new imports of Russian gold. This comes as the ruble has hit its highest level in seven years, but Blinken affirmed Russians are bearing the brunt of economic sanctions. According to the latest report by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34,530 Russian servicemen have died since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian forces have also destroyed 1,507 Russian tanks, 3,637 combat armoured vehicles, 759 artillery systems, 241 multiple rocket launcher systems, 99 air defense systems, 216 warplanes and 183 helicopters.“Even if Russia succeeds in capturing more territory, he will inherit cities and towns that his own artillery have turned to rubble and the local population that hates him,” he expressed.The world is horrified by Russia’s missile strike today, which hit a crowded Ukrainian shopping mall — the latest in a string of atrocities. We will continue to support our Ukrainian partners and hold Russia, including those responsible for atrocities, to account.— Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) June 27, 2022Blinken said that Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Putin is on the scene.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22175579892182.jpg, More Than 1M Voters Leave Democrat Party For GOP As Biden’s Approval Numbers Continue To SinkTOPICS:Antony BlinkenG-7GermanyGOLDnewsOANOANNPresident Vladimir PutinRussiaUkraineWar SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/blinken-standard-of-living-for-russians-is-dropping/

That’s according to voter registration data analyzed by the Associated Press.The findings show college educated voters in the suburbs returned to the Republican Party, despite opposing Donald Trump in 2020 elections. However, the Democrat Party gained 630,000 voters in cities, small towns and the suburban areas. The data shows Republicans are likely to retake the majority in Congress after November midterms.This comes as a rising number of Americans believe the US economy is getting worse and are concerned about their personal finances. According to a recent poll by CBS News and YouGov, 75 percent of Americans view the state of US economy as bad or getting worse. That’s up from 63 percent who said the same back in April.Additionally, 33 percent of respondents expressed concern for not affording basic goods while a total of 73percent said they are concerned about their ability to save money. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of Americans said… are confident about their retirement plans in this economy.","President Joe Biden gestures, during the G7 leaders’ summit at Castle Elmau in Kruen, near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Monday, June 27, 2022.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:54 PM PT – Monday, June 27, 2022Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D) suggested packing the Supreme Court could be an option after it overturned Roe v. Wade. In an interview Sunday, Abrams said she wants the Senate to abolish the filibuster for abortion and to allow the federal government to take over state election systems.“As someone who is pro-choice and proudly pro-choice, I believe we need leaders right now who are willing to defend who we are and defend the women under our care,” Abrams said. “We have to be deeply concerned about what is happening to our LGBTQ+ community, to people of color, especially black women who face the highest rates of maternal mortality in the nation and that is exacerbated in the state of Georgia. I believe we need to do more and I want the president to do more. I want our Congress to do more, but we have to recognize that the stage we are in right now is left to the states.”In 2019, a law was signed by Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp that would ban abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, generally at the six week point in a pregnancy. The law was held up in the courts as the Supreme Court considered Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which it decided on Friday, as it overturned Roe. Abrams claimed that the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs will help her in her campaign against Kemp. On Sunday, she voiced that she would work to reverse the state’s abortion ban if she defeats him in November.“I would tell anyone,” she expressed. “Whether you are a business or a citizen thinking about being in Georgia, take into very real consideration the danger that Brian Kemp poses to the life and welfare of women in the state.”We talked to a few Georgia women to hear their reactions in the aftermath of Roe being overturned, how they are personally impacted and why reproductive health care matters to them. pic.twitter.com/IErbJJelGd— Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) June 27, 2022The Democrat declared their is nothing sacrosanct about a nine justice Supreme Court.“This is a choice that has to be made by our both legislative and executive branch,” Abrams stated. “I think we have to recognize their is nothing sacrosanct about nine members on the United States Supreme Court, but that is a long term question.”Last week, Brian Kemp immediately asked the Court to allow his extreme and dangerous six-week abortion ban to take effect.Six weeks is before most women know they are pregnant.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, June 27, 2022World Bank President David Malpass said the global economy will significantly slow down due to high inflation, which will cause political problems in a number of countries. In an interview Sunday, Malpass said the US and it’s allies need to increase production of goods and services, while keeping their economies open and not restrict international trade.His remarks followed anti-Russian sanctions earlier this year that caused problems in the global energy, food and capital markets. He claimed the western world is facing an economic crisis.“It’s a sharp slowdown, including even China,” he said. “We’ve seen the world growth fall by half since January in terms of GDP growth, but there’s also shortages, there’s inflation.”Happy to speak with @POTUS @JoeBiden, @JPN_PMO @Kishida230, @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson, @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau & many others.Grateful for @G7 countries' strong support for the @WorldBank Group as we work to help countries address overlapping global crises.

He believes record inflation and shortages of key commodities like oil, fertilizer and wheat mean “it’s going to be very hard” for some countries to avoid recession.” It’s possible to produce enough to soften that crisis, but at the rate that we’re going right now the fertilizer isn’t being made,” he stated. “A giant source of fertilizer is from natural gas, through the ammonium channel into the most useful fertilizer. It also is used to make the electricity that converts the minerals into fertilize and that’s just not happening. A lot of the world is shutting down for lack of fertilizer and then those shortages of crops will last for multiple years.”The World Bank President admitted that a recession in the US isn’t out of the question, but he doesn’t disagree with estimates that put the risk of a recession in the US as high as 5o percent.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22178406615186.jpg, Abrams: Nothing Sacrosanct About 9 Member SCOTUSTOPICS:Chinafertilizerinflationnatural gasnewsOANOANNRECESSIONWorld Bank SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/world-bank-chief-were-at-a-crisis-countries-fall-in-one-by-one/

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has called on the Biden administration to provide abortions on federal lands in the states that may outlaw that practice. In an interview Sunday, the Democrat said this administration should send money and volunteers to establish abortion services in pro-life states.Federal lands include Indian reservations, national parks and military areas which are mostly in the western US. Warren also said Democrat-run states could provide abortion services to residents of red states.“Now, we’ve got a lot of things on our agenda right now,” said the Massachusetts lawmaker. “First of all, we need to help the women who are pregnant right now and need help. That means sending resources to states like New Mexico that border other states that are going to try to help out. It means getting involved by volunteering and sending money.”The Supreme Court abolished Roe v. Wade last week, prompting several red states to restrict abortions and sparking far-left protests across the nation.“Six justices have overturned Roe, but the Supreme Court doesn’t get the final say on abortion,” Warren noted. “The American people do. We must restore our democracy, so that a radical minority can no longer drown out the will of the people.”#RoeVWade is dead, and I am furious.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:37 AM PT – Tuesday, June 28, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave the US Supreme Court an ‘A’ grade in effectiveness and the Biden administration an ‘F’ for far-left.  While speaking at a rotary club in Florence, Kentucky on Monday, he praised recent decisions in the Supreme Court that bolstered the Second Amendment and stripped federal protections created by Roe v. Wade. McConnell claimed the Dobbs decision on abortion was the correct decision because it takes away the power to legislate the issue from a deeply divided Congress.“In the Senate, most things require 60 votes, not just 51,” he noted. “Neither side of this issue has come anywhere close to having 60 votes, so I think this is likely to all be litigated out in the various states around the country through the democratic process.”Meanwhile, McConnell stressed President Joe Biden has turned the executive branch into a far left playground. He pointed out Biden has never been a moderate, but claimed to be because he was running against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) for the Democrat presidential nomination.Since taking office, McConnell said Biden has shown his true colors. The GOP lawmaker vowed to stop him from further tilting America to the left when Republicans take back the Senate.“So, if I’m majority leader, we’ll be really picky on appointments,” said McConnell. “There’s 12,000 executive branch appointments that come to us. They’re not all as important as the Supreme Court, but many of them are quite important. They have to be confirmed by the Senate.”McConnell went on to say there’s still a chance for Biden to come back to the center if the predicted red wave crashes down in November. He then pointed out, Bill Clinton pulled back his sweeping agenda after the 1994 mid-term elections.In the meantime, McConnell asserted he will continue trying to center the Biden administration. Additionally, the Senate Minority Leader said he will compromise with Democrats on several issues like he did with raising the debt ceiling, infrastructure and gun control. However, he said the fate of America is up to the American people who will be giving Biden his ultimate midterm report card this November.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022.

We’ll be working w/ our partners to assist in every way w/ the investigation.— CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus (@CBPChrisMagnus) June 28, 2022San Antonio Fire Chief, Charles Hood said the survivors ranged in age and suffered from heat-related ailments“Fortunately, we were able to transport 16 people: 12 of those are adults and four are pediatric,” he stated. “All of them were conscious at the time upon transportation. The patients that we saw were hot to the touch. They were suffering from heat stroke, heat exhaustion. No signs of water in the vehicle. It was a refrigerated tractor-trailer, but there was no visible working AC unit on that rig.”San Antonio Mayor, Ron Nirenberg lamented at the human toll accumulated by traffickers taking advantage of people in need.“So I would urge you all to think compassionately and pray for the deceased, the ailing, the families,” he noted. “And we hope that those responsible for putting these people in such inhumane conditions are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”San Antonio Police Chief, William McManus said three individuals were taken into custody in connection to the incident, but it’s currently unknown whether the suspects were directly involved in human trafficking. An investigation into the matter is currently being spearheaded by the US Homeland Security Investigations.This administration continues to blatantly lie to the American people that the border is ""closed,"" ""effectively managed,"" and that they have ""operational control"" of it. It is a catastrophe of the highest degree. https://t.co/nf1oEY9yW1— Congressman Cliff Bentz (@RepBentz) June 28, 2022The incident is not the first human smuggling tragedy San Antonio has witnessed. Back in 2017, 10 migrants perished while trapped inside a truck at a Walmart parking lot. Additionally, the bodies of 19 migrants were found inside a vehicle during a heat wave back in 2003.","Police and other first responders work the scene where officials say dozens of people have been found dead and multiple others were taken to hospitals with heat-related illnesses after a semitrailer containing suspected migrants was found, Monday, June 27, 2022, in San Antonio.

During an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on Monday, Harris gave weight to her opinion on the ruling because she is a “woman.”This comment drew snide reactions on social media as many progressives have been unable to define the word “woman” and have asserted men can get pregnant. Harris also claimed the decision affects males as they will be forced into fatherhood instead of simply financing their partner’s abortion.﻿On Friday, liberal critics lambasted a picture Harris shared of herself watching the Supreme Court’s decision aboard Air Force Two. Comments accused the tweet of being “tone deaf” and out-of-touch.I know there are women out there who are afraid.

In an interview Monday, the California lawmaker weighed in on the left’s outrage at the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

For churches across the country. And for crisis pregnancy centers that are literally under attack from the radical Left.— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) June 25, 2022McCarthy also accused Democrats of gas lighting the American public by claiming Roe’s end was un-democratic. Rather than outlawing abortion, the House Minority Leader said the ruling allows citizens to decide the issue on a state-by-state basis.“Democrats aren’t just for abortion, every single one in Congress voted to have abortion up to the moment of birth,” he noted. “America does not support that. So now what most people would want (is) to have their own opinion, be able to have input in it, within each state and that’s what will go forward.”""Today's Supreme Court decision in Dobbs is the most important pro-life ruling in American history…The right to life has been vindicated.

Demetrius Freeman/Pool via REUTERSOAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:52 PM PT – Monday, June 27, 2022Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and his wife Erin warned the Democrat Party has been taken over by far -left activists who are fighting against democracy. During an interview on Monday, the Hawley’s called out the Biden administration for encouraging protesters to use violent means to express their frustration.“It’s outrageous,” Hawley stated. “The Biden administration has really turned a blind eye towards this left-wing violence and have really encouraged it by saying it’s fine to protest at the justice’s homes even though it is illegal.”DOJ needs to announce a zero tolerance policy for violence right now. They’ve left radical leftists run wild – threatening the Justices, burning pregnancy care centers. No more. Protests are constitutionally protected but violence is not. DOJ must put a stop to it immediately— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) June 24, 2022They pointed out Antifa protesters were protesting outside their home while Erin was helping Mississippi lawyers in the Dobbs v. Jackson case. This as some left-wing activists called for the deaths of Republican appointed Supreme Court justices for overturning Roe v. Wade in their Dobbs decision.“It really shows that the radical left has become very anti-Democratic,” he said. “What they don’t want is the people to have any say when it comes to laws protecting life and the regulation of abortion. They don’t want the people in the states or anywhere to be able to weigh in and that is what this decision does. It turns it back to the people. That is not what the left wants and it really shows.”Sen. Hawley pointed out that the Biden administration officials have fanned the flames of these threats. In the meantime, Erin Hawley stressed the Dobbs ruling empowers women who can have babies in a world with better technology and financial resources to help them carry to term and beyond.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2LZH3HPVE5N4TJIYO3G57Q5WWY-scaled-e1652466074198.jpg," One-On-One With The Co-Founder Of The Radiance Foundation, Ryan BombergerTOPICS:democratsdobberin hawleyJosh HawleynewsOANOANNpoliticsREPUBLICANSRoe v.
