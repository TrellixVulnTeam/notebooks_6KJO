2022-09-08,10:08 AM PT,Heat wave strains Calif. power grid,"California Governor Gavin Newsom has continued to ask residents to help reduce strain on the state’s power grid amid the current heat wave. On Wednesday, the Democrat held a press conference to address the wavering power grid.This came after Tuesday’s demand for 52,000 megawatts set a record as resident experienced triple digit temperatures. Demand is only expected to climb as high as 78,000 megawatts in the coming years as the state has backed itself into a corner to go completely green by 2045.“We’ll do our part to make sure we never have to go through this again,” stated the governor. “And that’s the continued transition to more battery storage, to transition to more energy and backup supply, new strategic reserve that we got through the legislature, some $4.2 billion was just passed, will provide an additional 4000 megawatts by 2024.”Newsom confirmed the state’s independent system operator has not called for any load reductions. As the governor’s energy policies have really put Californians in a bind, one new pilot program could provide relief.

McCabe — OAN National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 12:43 PM PT – Thursday, September 8, 2022This week, Florida Republican Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis picked up endorsements from the Everglades Trust and the Florida Farm Bureau Federation FarmPAC, and a new poll shows him leading his Democratic rival Charlie Crist among independents.The Everglades Trust Support is almost against type for a conservative Republican, but the DeSantis Administration has focused on cleaning up the state, so now the DeSantis campaign is touting its environmental successes.The second endorsement from the Florida Farm Bureau Federation FarmPAC, came at an event hosted Tuesday by the Florida Strawberry Growers and the governor accepted the endorsements, surrounded by tractors and blue jeans.The governor also released a new commercial titled “Results.”In the ad, more than 20 people thanked DeSantis for standing up for them, included in the group were a nurse, a waitress, a schoolteacher, a minister and a police officer are just some of them.Not only did they thank the governor for keeping the schools, restaurants, and churches open, but they also thanked him for standing up for them in the culture wars.One of the people featured is a young female swimmer who thanked the governor for protecting her right to compete, maybe, the most poignant message is from the Special Olympics golfer Isabella Valle.When the Special Olympics International tried to impose a vax mandate on all its athletes, DeSantis intervened, and he banned the vaccine mandate in the state, which allowed Valle to continue to compete.The pairing of the two is the emotional cornerstone of the commercial.Swimmer: “You let us compete.”Isabella Valle: “All of us.”Finally, there’s a new poll from the firm Susquehanna Polling and Research, showing DeSantis four points ahead of Crist, 47percent to 43 percent. The question is, is this race tightening?DeSantis leads independents, which is critical, because he lost independents four years ago.Another positive for the governor is his favorable-unfavorable numbers, are 50 percent favorable versus 43 percent unfavorable, so he has plus seven.Whereas, his Democratic rival, Charlie Crist, is underwater, 35 percent favorable versus 48 percent unfavorable, negative 13.TOPICS:Charlie CristFarmPACNeil W.

Democrat challenger Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) made it known that he’s proud of Biden’s recent prime time speech. In his speech, the President accused MAGA Republicans of being a threat to democracy.On Tuesday while making remarks to his supporters, Crist applauded Biden’s address. This positive feedback comes despite many critics calling it dark and divisive. While he was praising Biden for not “holding back,” the Democrat also took the opportunity to aim at DeSantis.“The guy (Biden) is telling the truth,” Crist said. “Democracy is at stake in this election and the point of the spear is Florida. I mean we have an autocrat in Governor DeSantis, who would like to be a dictator of America. He wants to run for President, uh I think that’s crystal clear to everybody. And what President Biden did was ring the alarm and say ‘this is a real threat to democracy in our Country.’”DeSantis released a new campaign ad on Tuesday. The ad focused on the people of Florida and how the Governor’s decisions in 2020 had positively impacted Florida citizens.

The former Secretary of State said that then FBI director, James Comey, ruined her chances of getting elected.“There’s no doubt at all that he (James Comey) impacted very negatively my chances of winning,” Clinton said. “So, it was in the middle of an election, there was no ‘there there’ and the guy never shut up.”Clinton then went on to praise the current leaders of the DOJ and FBI. She claimed they’ve been “incredibly patient and careful.”Her remarks come as many believe the current FBI and DOJ are biased against former President Trump.

The State is at risk of blackouts which Newsom blames on the summer heat wave. Earlier in the week, Newsom warned about the threat to California’s power grid. He urged residents to reduce their use of electricity.“Californians, you’ve stepped up to help in a big way to keep the lights on so far,” Newsom said. “But we’re heading into the worst part of this heat wave. And the risk for outages is real and it’s immediate. These triple- digit temperatures throughout much of the are State are leading, not surprisingly, to record demand on the energy grid.”DeSantis stressed that it was ridiculous that Newsom criticized Florida.

Unfortunately in Michigan, some of these people have been dead for over 20 years, and they’re still on the voter rolls. We just want the law to be enforced.”PILF is a legal nonprofit group suing Benson regarding an alleged violation of the National Voter Registration Act. Benson is a facing count of failure to conduct list maintenance.“We found 25,000 people were dead and still on the voter rolls in Michigan,” Adams revealed. “The fact that there’s dead registrants on the rolls is not a Michigan problem,” Adams continued. “What’s a Michigan problem is the seeming unwillingness to do anything about it.”Adams claims PILF gave the names of these allegedly dead registrants before the 2020 election.“As far as we can tell, years have gone by, after we gave the names to Michigan, and nothing has happened in large part,” Adams said. “And they’ve just demanded to know more about us than the actual investigation they ought to be doing of the names.”Adams says PILF has a rigorous process as to how it collects and cross references data.“We do this all over the country,” Adams explained. “We collect the voter rolls, and then we bounce them against a whole bunch of indicators as to whether or not somebody’s dead. We try to get it right by using the social security death index, social security matches. We use obituaries and gravestones. We also use credit reporting services, people who are in the business of knowing whether or not you’re alive. We use all of this information. That’s out there to derive our list.”Adams says PILF has a history of success in lawsuits, citing a settlement against the State Department of Pennsylvania to remove deceased voters from the voter rolls in April 2021. “There aren’t false positives in the data,” said Adams. “If anything we were conservative. We found other people who’ve been dead that weren’t even on the list because there could be a name match issue.”“These registrants are dead,” Adams continued. “Period. And so we will be successful one way or another, because the dead registrants eventually one way or another are going to be removed. It’s a question of how much kicking and screaming goes on before that day comesOne America News reached out to Benson for comment, but has yet to hear back as of publishing this article.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png," Biden Admin.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:45 PM PT – Thursday, September 8, 2022America’s adversaries seem to be gaining ground on their problematic ambitions which may challenge US National Security. On Wednesday, the US State Department lamented Joe Biden’s main foreign policy goal. His goal revived the failed Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran. It has yet to hit yet another setback in talks with the Rouge State.Last month, Iran gave a proposal to the EU diplomats who are negotiating on behalf of America. Officials hoped it would lead to a final deal. However, last week after US officials responded by saying that some of the demands were unreasonable, Iran sent another proposal which the State Department deemed not constructive.These developments are not going to deter Biden diplomats from trying to pursue the deal despite Israeli news outlets claiming Biden told their Prime Minister that a deal with Iran was off the table for now. Verdant Patel, the Principal Deputy Spokesperson of the State Department spoke on the issue.“It is an extraordinarily complex set of issues,” explained Patel. “It is unfortunate that Iran’s response to us took us backwards, and we, of course, are not going to conclude a deal that is not in the US national security interest. But this is something that we’re continuing to pursue. We are studying Iran’s response, we are coordinating with our E3 allies and we’re continuing to go through this process.”Additionally, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed the potential death of the deal with its latest assessment of Iran’s nuclear program. Earlier this year, the IAEA warned that Iran was just months away from enriching enough uranium to make a nuclear weapon. Now, it’s believed that Iran has reached that point. They stressed it cannot say whether Iran’s nuclear program is entirely peaceful.Additionally, Iran has resisted requests from the IAEA to open up its nuclear facilities to an international inspection. In the meantime, the Biden State Department still believes it can seal a deal with the Ayatollah and get Iran to simmer its ambitions.“There is really only one ultimate end goal of this deal Sayid, and that is to ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. And that continues to be our vision forward and be the reason why we continue to pursue this, because we believe that a mutual return to compliance will help us get there. It will put restraints on Iran’s nuclear program,” Patel said. “It’s an important step for regional stability and in the national security interest of the United States.”Meanwhile in East Asia, Biden’s special Envoy for North Korea, Sung Kim, is trying to rally regional partners in order to establish defense measures in case the Kim Jong-un government sparks a conflict. Ambassador Kim and his counterparts from Japan and South Korea held a conference in Tokyo where they all vowed to respond swiftly to any provocation from Pyongyang.They warned that North Korea is gearing up to conduct its first nuclear test since 2017. The newest test will add to its increasing tests of military equipment as its military has launched more than 30-missiles this year.“We are preparing for all contingencies in close coordination with our Japan and South Korea allies and we are prepared to make short and long-term adjustments to our military posture in responding to the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) provocation,” Kim remarked. “We are committed to both defense and deterrence to protect our allies in the region.”Despite the worrisome activities by Iran and North Korea, it seems that the Biden administration is willing to listen to its allies in Israel and East Asia. The Counties are calling for action against Countries that may threaten regional stability with aspirations to develop a nuclear weapon.","Secretary of State Antony Blinken listens as President Joe Biden speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:15 PM PT – Thursday, September 8, 2022The White House has launched a new program to distribute additional Monkeypox vaccines.When speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, National Monkeypox Response Coordinators Bob Fenton and Doctor Demetre Daskalakis, announced that they’ve been seeing a strong progress in vaccine distribution. Additionally, they reported that over 460,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered despite admitting the at-risk population currently sits at 1.6 million people.“We only have data from 35 jurisdictions,” Dr. Daskalakis said. “That’s just over half of all jurisdictions that are directly receiving vaccine. But over 460,000 doses have been administered. Keep in mind, the population at highest risk is approximately 1.6 million people right now. So even with this partial view we have now from the reporting jurisdictions, we’re seeing strong progress, really getting shots into arms.”Fenton also announced they were launching a program to address a racial disparity in vaccine distribution and will begin providing vaccines to the LGBTQ community in preparation for upcoming Pride events.“Our focus now is to reach the remainder of the eligible population where they are – at trusted locations and events across the Country. And equity has to be a key point and priority embedded in throughout our response,” Fenton said. “We are launching a new program that allows local health departments to request vaccines to use innovatively through strategies to reach Black and brown communities. And today, we’re announcing that we’re providing more vaccines to upcoming Pride events across the country.”Daskalakis and Fenton then went on to address questions about how they will be funding their program, saying they have plenty of money to launch their efforts. However, they implied that additional funding may be required to keep their fight going.“So we have enough money right now to make the key decisions we need to make. But as this progresses, we need to replenish what we’ve used and be able to have additional funding to keep the fight going,” Fenton said. “The low hanging fruit has been gotten. The folks who are early adopters for this vaccine have gotten it. And now we’re really on to the next level, which is making sure that that everyone who needs it gets it.”The White House had previously requested $4.5 billion to combat the spread of the virus.","Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, right, White House Monkeypox response deputy coordinator, speaks alongside Bob Fenton, White House Monkeypox response coordinator, during a press briefing at the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2022, in Washington.
