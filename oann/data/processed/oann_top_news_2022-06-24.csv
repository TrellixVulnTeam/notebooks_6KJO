9:54 AM PT",WAPO writer appears to ‘inadvertently’ write a heart-warming pro-life story,"It appears a Washington Post writer unintentionally sent out a pro-life message in her latest feature story. The article, published Monday, featured the story of a young Texas woman named Brooke who, under the state’s Heartbeat Act, could not get an abortion as her pregnancy had already exceeded six weeks.Although the writer intended to showcase the act’s supposed cruelty for forcing pregnant women to become mothers, the story took a positive turn when Brooke decided to keep her 12-weeks old babies she discovered to be twins. However, many on Twitter caught the writer’s condescending portrayal of Brooke’s new maternal life, slamming the author for portraying Brooke’s twins as if they were a major inconvenience and barricade to her success.At one point, Caroline Kitchener claimed Brooke would have still been in school with her “eyes on a real estate license” and how she would have enjoyed her long-desired trip to Hawaii had the twins not been born. A pro-life activist reacted by accusing Kitchener of depicting Brooke’s life to be bleak and dark, while a leftist author praised the article for illustrating how women are supposedly “manipulated” by the pro-life movement.She trusted you and you wrote a cruel, condescending piece about her. You objectified her & her beautiful girls for your own pro-abortion ideology. You didn’t help her, instead you did everything you could to make her look ignorant, & her future look as bleak & dark as possible. https://t.co/FEQenammUA— Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) June 21, 2022Kitchener reinforced the incongruence between her sentiments and Brooke’s by tweeting how much Brooke aches for the life she may never have despite her deep love for her children. Despite this, Brooke said she immediately believed her twins were a miracle from God the moment she saw them in the ultrasound, hence her decision to keep her children.This scenario is what Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and what other conservatives are calling an amazing and compelling pro-life story.",(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo),https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/wapo.jpg," Biden Admin.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:30 AM PT – Thursday, June 23 2022Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the Defense Production Act is a “tool” in the Biden administration’s belt to address high gas prices. While speaking to reporters Wednesday, she said the administration has not drawn any lines in the sand at the moment in terms of invoking the defense law or other emergency measures.Granholm also told reporters President Joe Biden can’t control the price of gas alone and acknowledged his proposed federal gas tax suspension won’t have a substantial impact on prices. She then emphasized Biden’s outreach to the oil industry.“He’s calling upon states as well to consider doing gas tax holidays,” explained the Energy Secretary. “On the state side, he’s urging oil companies to use their profits to increase output. He’s calling upon the industry to pass along the decrease in oil prices, which we have seen at the barrel level over the past week, for example, at the pump. And he is demanding that that the industry come to the table with some solutions on refineries.”Granholm also said the nation needs more creativity and collaboration to get through what she called an “unprecedented” situation. She then pointed her finger at Russia’s Vladimir Putin and his war in Ukraine as well as the aftermath of pandemic constraints.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm blames record gas prices on ""Putin's war"" and domestic energy producers.No mention of the Biden administration's anti-American energy obsession. pic.twitter.com/GKwZLTdnCL— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 22, 2022The Energy Secretary went on to suggest that that President alone cannot control the spiking gas prices, which is why he has asked Congress as well as companies in gas and oil industry to act.On record gas prices, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm says ""the only way out"" is by ""deploying clean energy."" pic.twitter.com/FJu0HlnnmB— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 22, 2022Granholm said “the only way out” is by “deploying clean energy.” These sentiments echo the Biden administration’s continued push for so-called green energy.","Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022.

In an address to the BRICS Business Forum Wednesday, he proposed a new reserve currency that will be used for payments in international trade.Putin said the new payment method will be based off the basket of national currencies of BRICS member states: Brazil, Russia, India, China (PRC), South Africa and Russia. He then noted trade in goods and services within the bloc has surged in recent months amid failed Western sanctions.“Our countries are home to more than 3 billion people and together account for about a quarter of the global GDP, 20 percent of trade and roughly 25 percent of direct investments, while the total international reserves of the BRICS countries (as of the beginning of 2022) amount to about 35 percent  of world reserves,” Putin stated. “The Russian MIR payment system is expanding its presence. We are exploring the possibility of creating an international reserve currency based on the basket of BRICS currencies.”Putin went on to say Russia is deepening trading ties with China and India while increasing technology cooperation with South Africa and Brazil.#Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking at #BRICS Business Forum: Anyone who blocks others' way will only have his own path blocked. #XiSays pic.twitter.com/NrBV21yZXR— Zhang Meifang张美芳 (@CGMeifangZhang) June 23, 2022Meanwhile, former United Nations envoy Nikki Haley warned “Western weakness” encourages China to pursue more assertive foreign policies.

When asked why, Biden warned the next plague may be just around the horizon.“But we don’t just need more money for vaccines for children eventually, we need more money to plan for the second pandemic,” he asserted. “There’s going to be another pandemic, we have to think ahead.

The Governor voiced that he is dedicated to providing Oklahomans relief amid skyrocketing gas prices, high taxes and runaway inflation.He insisted that Oklahomans need “relief right now,” not just a check for a tank of gas that will come in December.” This comes after Stitt called for a special session of the legislature back in May and demanded more solutions. He said Oklahoma is one of only 13 states taxing groceries and that he’s committed to changing this in his inflation relief package.“My inflation relief plan includes eliminating the state grocery tax and cutting personal income tax for every single Oklahoman,” he stated. “This will save the average Oklahoma family $453 each and every year.”The Governor was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, who also highlighted the Biden administration’s inability to provide real relief with it’s current budget plan. He reminded Oklahomans they should not have to wait for the Federal Government.“The only tax reform that’s currently in the budget is motor vehicle tax,” the governor uttered. “That’s not real relief. It only helps those who can afford a new car or  truck in the first place. Cutting the new car sales tax does nothing for families who are struggling to afford price for food, gas and everything in between.”If President Biden really wants to help lower energy costs for Americans, he should stop following the socialist Democrats’ energy playbook and start following Oklahoma’s.My response response to the president's proposal for a three-month federal gas tax holiday: pic.twitter.com/8wESy7MoOv— Governor Kevin Stitt (@GovStitt) June 22, 2022In addition to inflation relief, Stitt said he will always “back the blue” and ensure state law enforcement receives a pay increase.“Something I’m really excited about is pay increases four our law enforcement, he expressed. We will always back the blue in Oklahoma.”Stitt is now seeking re-election for his second term and his campaign got a major boost. He got backed with the backing of Trump.

We started to count the floors trying to find the apartment and we saw that half of my sisters apartment was still standing. 15 days later we got a knock on our door that they recovered my sister.”Additionally, they spoke about their experience in trying to get answers from Florida’s state attorney regarding what caused the tragedy. By their recollection most of their information regarding the collapse came from the media.“Show me the document,” said Langesfield. “This is an official document by the State Attorney Katherine Fernandez rundle who has declined to meet with us, with many families countless times. It’s around 40 pages. The first sentence of the document speaking in the collapse has the wrong date.”The posts were originally set up along a makeshift memorial wall about a block west on Harding Avenue last summer. HistoryMiami took the wall down for preservation but the town of Surfside got the posts back for the vigil and has offered to give them to family members.

She became a very good lawyer. To seek justice, this is what we want. Whoever is being held responsible has to pay.”In the meantime, a memorial service is scheduled to take place later this week on Friday. Jill Biden is slated to make an appearance.","Martin Langesfeld, left, is joined by his parents Pablo and Andrea Langesfeld, as they speak at ceremony honoring Martin’s sister and Pablo and Andrea’s daughter Nicole “Nicky” Langesfeld, who died in the Surfside, Fla., condo collapse, before unveiling a sign for “Nicky Langesfeld Place,” Wednesday, June 22, 2022, in Doral, Fla.

Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:50 PM PT – Thursday, June 23 2022The US Senate advanced the bipartisan gun reform bill clearing the way for its full approval by the end of this week. The senate voted 65 to 34 on Thursday, to break a filibuster on the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act” despite concerns it may violate the Second Amendment.“This bipartisan gun safety legislation is progress and will save lives,” said Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “While it is not everything we want, this legislation is urgently needed.”The last significant federal gun control legislation was passed in 1994. It banned the manufacture for civilian use of assault rifles and large capacity ammunition clips.The bill will increase background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21. It also closes legal loopholes in buying firearms and will provide funding for mental health programs and security in schools. The blueprint will also call for funding to incentivize states to implement “Red Flag” laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat.As the extremist Roberts Court strikes down gun-safety measures—it's urgent for us to act at every level of governmentToday, we'll finally take steps to loosen the gun lobby’s grip and pass a law that'll save livesAnd we'll keep working—More must be done to fight gun violence pic.twitter.com/wO3JGnP5bk— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 23, 2022 This comes as the Supreme Court ruled to expand gun rights the same day, allowing American’s to carry firearms in public for self defense. However the National Rifle Association,  rejected the deal.“We will oppose this gun control legislation because it falls short at every level,” the NRA said in a statement. “It does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law abiding gun owners.”Proponents of the bill hope to get it passed before this weekend just ahead of the July recess.","Sen.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:26 PM PT – Thursday, June 23 2022NFL Commissioner Rodger Goodell appeared virtually before House lawmakers to testify about the Washington Commanders and league’s handling of workplace misconduct in the organization.The House Oversight Committee heard from Goodell during a hearing Wednesday, as part of its probe into workplace culture at the NFL team based in the nation’s capital. This as the panel released a memo in which Commanders owner Daniel Snyder was accused of harassing, intimidating and trying to silence individuals who had alleged sexual harassment in the organization.Among the allegations detailed by the panel, Snyder was suspected of sending private investigators to the homes of accusers to offer them hush money and discourage them from participating in an investigation led by attorney Beth Wilkinson. The committee said Snyder’s work to interfere in the probe may have been to conceal or distract from his own role in troubling conduct. Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said the NFL was aware of his actions, but failed to stop him.” In April, six attorneys general condemned the NFL for its ongoing failure to address sexual harassment and gender discrimination across the league,” said Goodell. “The NFL itself has launched new investigations based on evidence brought to light by the committee.”""Commissioner, you believe in the First Amendment, don't ya?"" –@Jim_Jordan ""I do."" -NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ""Why do you ban @stoolpresidente from NFL games?"" -Jordan""Congressman, I'm not familiar with that issue."" -Goodell pic.twitter.com/ynlHj8CO9o— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) June 22, 2022Snyder declined to appear at the hearing, while a spokesperson said the hearing was “a politically charged show trial.” He added that Congress should not be investigating “an issue a football team addressed years ago.” Goodell acknowledged the work place in Washington was unacceptable in numerous aspects and asserted he is devoted to ensuring a safe and professional work environment.“I have been and remain committed to ensuring that all employees of the NFL and the 32 clubs work in a professional and supportive environment that is free from discrimination, harassment or other forms of illegal or unprofessional conduct,” stated Goodell.The NFL Commissioner also told lawmakers he does not have the authority to remove Snyder as an owner, but his fellow owners could vote to do so. Maloney plans to subpoena Snyder for a deposition next week.","NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell testifies virtually, Wednesday, June 22, 2022, during a House Oversight Committee hearing on the Washington Commanders’ workplace conduct, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Police said Steve Bruemmer was swimming at Lovers Point Beach in Pacific Grove when he was attacked by a shark Wednesday morning. The attack left him with serious injuries to his arm, stomach and leg.Nearby surfers were able to pull Bruemmer onto a board and to the beach. Good Samaritans began performing first aid until paramedics arrived. Witnesses described seeing a very large shark. Firefighters deployed a drone to search for the shark, but authorities were unable to locate the animal following a search.“I saw there was a swimmer out there and he was screaming for help,” said a local police officer. “Then some paddleboarders went after him, got him on the board, brought him in and the paramedics took him away. He was screaming for help, you could tell just from the sound and emotion in his voice that there was something definitely wrong. He was slapping the water, as a police officer I respond to emergencies all the time.

Chiu)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:24 AM PT – Thursday, June 23 2022Six major US cities are set to surpass the record violent crime rates they set in 2021. According to crime data, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Atlanta and New York City are all on pace to supersede their levels of violent crime last year.The Big Apple has seen a near 26 percent jump in violent crime compared to the same time last year, while Washington D.C. has experienced an 8 percent hike. Meanwhile, Philadelphia and Baltimore have recorded increases of seven and 6.1 percent respectively.“People are robbing, people are killing people,” said Janice Johnson Dias, a sociology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “People are doing a lot of things, I don’t feel safe as we used to.” Janice Johnson Dias, a sociology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Homicides are reportedly driving violent crime rates up nationwide, increasing 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 and an additional 5 percent from 2020 to 2021 with rates expected to increase again this year. Experts say anti-police sentiment, an emergence from pandemic restrictions and a lack of judicial enforcement are to blame amid waning confidence in government’s ability to protect it’s citizens.In California, residents of some cities have pushed to recall liberal district attorneys. San Francisco voters recalled District Attorney Chesa Boudin earlier this month, partly due to his policies which eased prosecution and pushed for reduced incarcerations. In Los Angeles County, opponents of District Attorney George Gascon are currently collecting signatures to trigger a recall election against the progressive“I think as goes California, so goes the nation,” stated Jonathan Hatami, Deputy District Attorney of Los Angeles County. “And so what we’re looking at really is that we’ve given Chesa Boudin the boot in San Francisco, we are going to give George Gascon the boot in Los Angeles. And I do believe that will be the beginning of the end of the reign of rogue and radical prosecutors throughout the nation.”Earlier this month, the Recall DA George Gascon campaign announced they passed the official threshold of signatures needed to initiate a recall and revealed they collected nearly 567,000 signatures.Volunteers make this movement possible. Thank you! We’ve eclipsed 567,000 signatures. Aiming to reach at least 700k by July 6. We are so close to taking a major step towards recalling Gascon and saving LA.
