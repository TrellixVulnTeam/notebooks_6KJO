2:25 PM PT",Hunter: Joe Biden would do ‘anything I want him to’,"A new audio tape from Hunter Biden’s laptop reveals the President’s son was saying Joe Biden would do anything that he would ask him to. The tape was released by the Washington Examiner on Tuesday.In the audio, Hunter relayed the message that business deals overseas exposed him to undue foreign influence, which he could pass on to Joe Biden.“He’ll talk about anything that I want him to, that he believes in,” Hunter stated. “If I say it’s important to me, then he will work a way in which to make it a part of his platform.”Republicans have said Hunter’s multi-million deals in Ukraine in China could have influenced the Biden administration’s policy in those countries as well as at home in the US. However, Hunter downplayed any political risks of his questionable businesses.“My dad respects me more than he respects anyone in the world, and I know that to be certain,” he stated. “So it’s not going to be about whether it affects his politics…”Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are continuing their investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden’s foreign businesses dealings. They said a deeper probe would begin after midterm elections.","Joe Biden, left, and his son Hunter Biden, right, in Vancouver, Canada.

(Roberto Schmidt/Pool via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:57 AM PT – Tuesday, June 14, 2022Biden administration diplomats have continued to push their influence on world affairs through Asia. On Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a press conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin. The two top diplomats took aim at North Korea.The US-South Korea and North Korea relations have been strained since Joe Biden took over the presidency. Biden has continued to order joint military drills between America and South Korea’s military. This has garnered threats from Kim Jong-un’s regime who have equated those exercises to declarations of war.Last week, Kim called to bolster the country’s military while claiming the international sphere is a “aggravating environment.” The rouge state has launched dozens of ballistic missile tests so far this year and US Intelligence officials warned another test of a nuclear weapon is on the horizon.Secretary Blinken stressed, if North Korea wants to be taken seriously by international leaders then it will have to gain favor through diplomacy.“A nuclear test would be dangerous, it would be deeply destabilizing to the region,” stated the US official. “It would blatantly violate international law as set out in multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, so we urge the DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing activity. We call on the DPRK to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy.”America’s top diplomat went on to say North Koreans could be negatively affected if its government continues its path toward instability.“We want to support the people of North Korea, including with COVID-19 vaccines,” Blinken noted. “Indeed, we have offered our help consistently throughout the pandemic and again during the awful surge that they are now enduring, which comes on top of severe economic and humanitarian crises. Our goal, simply put, is a peaceful and stable region and world. Until the regime in Pyongyang changes course, we will continue to keep the pressure on.”Meanwhile, State Department Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman was sent to Vietnam to cement ties with Hanoi. Sherman touted the US has pledged nearly 20 million to help clean up any unexploded ordinances left over from the Vietnam war. Additionally, she promised to work with Vietnamese officials to combat illegal wildlife trafficking.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman shakes hands with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Monday, June 13, 2022.

(AP Photo/Hoang Duong)Both countries seem to agree that they are integral partners and can be a strong influence for the Association of Southeast Asians Nations (ASEAN).“We agree with you our partnership is critical to ensure an independent and prosperous Vietnam,” said Sherman. “We have great respect for each other’s systems and our joint efforts are to build a better future for our people.”I had a productive meeting with @FMBuiThanhSon today in Hanoi. We discussed ways we can elevate the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership and support @ASEAN centrality. pic.twitter.com/aTvvzpWOF4— Wendy R. Sherman (@DeputySecState) June 13, 2022Additionally, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Thai defense officials in Bangkok. The military leaders discussed modernizing Thailand’s military in several areas, including cyber security and space technology.These discussions were met with the wrath of the Chinese Communist Party who has taken aim at the Biden administration for trying to turn leaders in the region against them. Chinese officials claim that along with engaging in diplomatic relations with Asian officials, the US is also making allegations that China wants to subjugate Taiwanese residents.“The US’ remarks vilifying China will not fool the international community, but only compromise its own credibility,” stated Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin. “We urge the US to match its words with deeds, follow through on its commitment not to seeking confrontation or conflict, not to seeking ‘a new Cold War’ or ‘an Asian version of NATO’ or forming antagonistic blocs in the region.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin.

Kathy Hochul delivers her first State of the State address in the Assembly Chamber at the state Capitol, Wednesday, Jan. 5, 2022, in Albany, N.Y. (AP Photo/Hans Pennink, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:42 AM PT – Tuesday, June 14, 2022New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) signed a bill expanding abortion access in the Empire State. She approved six bills to make her state a “safe haven” for the procedure in case the Supreme Court rules Roe v. Wade to be unconstitutional.“Our heart goes out to the women in those other states, we’ll be there for the women of other states,” stated the governor. “And mark my words, just never, never, here in the state of New York because New York has always been a beacon for those yearning to be free. And I want the world to hear that that will never change”.The laws are intended to provide legal protections for both abortion participants and providers from outside states where the operation may be outlawed, including the prevention of New York authorities from cooperating with outside law enforcement agencies in abortion-related investigations as well as restricting out-of-state medical malpractice insurance claims against New York abortion providers. Additionally, Empire State abortion providers will be immune to professional misconduct charges while institutions that refuse to perform abortions may be sued.Under one of the provisions, abortion providers may even obscure their addresses in order to evade legal action. The governor also announced the formation of a task force that will research the effects of pro-life pregnancy centers. Hochul alleged these protections for abortion are by extension protection for so-called “bodily autonomy.”“Because as the first female governor of New York, I take this personally and that’s a fight I’m willing to take on,” she continued. “Not just on behalf of the women of New York, but for women all across this nation. I refuse to go backwards and I promise you, as long as I’m governor, we will not because these are rights that have been fought for, for generations. And New York State has led every step of the way.”Despite championing bodily autonomy, Hochul maintained former Governor Andrew Cuomo’s health care worker COIVD-19 vaccine mandate,. On top of that, New Yorkers were required to be vaccinated to participate in various indoor activities earlier this year.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court could hand down its decision on Roe as soon as Wednesday. Should the measure be stricken down, each state will have sovereignty over its own abortion policy.","New York Gov.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:43 AM PT – Wednesday, June 15, 2022As expected by many, the Federal Reserve is undertaking the biggest interest rate increase since 1994. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced the Central Bank is raising interest rates by 0.75 percent, which is up to a range of 1.5 to 1.75percent.This is the Fed’s latest attempt to bring down record-high inflation, which hit 8.6 percent in May. This marks the highest level in more than 40-years. Last month, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.5 percent, which was the biggest single rate hike since 2000.﻿A new poll has suggested a majority of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. In the Politico/Morning Consult survey released Wednesday, 74 percent of respondents said things in the US have gotten off on the wrong track compared to just 26 percent who said things are headed in the right direction.The poll also found 56 percent of respondents disapprove of the job Democrat President Joe Biden is doing in the Oval Office. This may comes as no surprise as high inflation, supply chain issues and other economic issues have prompted concerns of a potential recession.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce more hikes later this year, despite fears it may cause a recession, as officials are trying to bring inflation down to 2 percent. This comes as inflation woes have continued to hurt pocketbooks of every day Americans.","FILE – Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve, Wednesday, May 4, 2022 in Washington.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:02 AM PT – Wednesday, June 15, 2022President Joe Biden has continued to insist the economy is on the right track while economists warn of an impending recession. While speaking to union workers on Tuesday, Biden touted his economic performance despite record high inflation.“The bottom line is this; I truly believe we made extraordinary progress by laying a new foundation for our economy, which becomes clear once global inflation begins to recede,” claimed the President. “There’s so much at stake, but the truth is I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am today.”While Biden is more optimistic than ever, economist don’t share the rose-colored outlook. According to a recent Financial Times survey, nearly 70 percent of economists expects the US to spiral into a recession in 2023. Biden then went to say he will continue to rely on foreign markets to bring down the cost of fuel, which has reached a national average of $5 a gallon according to AAA.“So I have a plan to bring down the cost of gas and food,” said the President. “It’s going to take time, but let the world coordinate the largest release. What I’ll be able to do for the largest release of oil from the global fund in history. Million barrels a day and 240 million barrels to boost global supply. I convinced other nations to join us to keep prices from rise, keep prices from rising even more.”Biden is set to visit to Saudi Arabia later this year to speak with the country’s Crown Prince about possibly importing some of their oil. Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute has put out a 10 point proposal that promotes domestic oil production, which they asserted is a better solution to ease the pain at the pump.“This is America, we can do any damn thing we put our minds tom” Biden stated. “And guess what? We’re not going back to the false promises of trickle down economics. We’re going forward.”My Administration will continue to do everything we can to lower prices for the American people, but Congress has to act as well. pic.twitter.com/TPxSpOSnVa— President Biden (@POTUS) June 13, 2022Despite all the warnings from experts, Biden remains convinced the American economy is improving under his administration.

Tom Rice in South Carolina. Fry won with more than 51 percent, therefore, eliminating a no run-off. Rice, who voted to impeach Trump in 2021, said earlier Tuesday that Trump’s hold on the GOP was waning.“I had hoped that the situation would have been reversed, but again, this seat doesn’t belong to me,” Rice stated. “It belongs to the voters, right?

During a press conference on Tuesday, the Florida representative said the money Americans have to pay at the pump could be going to better use.🚨 ICYMI 🚨Yesterday, in a @housebudgetGOP committee hearing on the impact of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, I outlined how this disastrous stimulus package has caused record-high inflation, soaring gas prices, and suffering for the American worker.Watch below ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/cCYNF8Ju5Z— Congressman Byron Donalds (@RepDonaldsPress) June 15, 2022While families struggle to pay for gas and put food on the table, consumer prices have increased significantly as well. US inflation rate increased to 8.6 percent last month, which is the highest in more than 40-years. Americans’ personal finances are becoming considerably tighter.“You can’t take that vacation, you can’t go buy that new article of clothing, you can’t go do the next thing that you choose to do,” said Donalds. “This inflation is the largest tax increase on poor families and middle income families in decades in the United States.”The Republican lawmaker called out President Biden for comments the President made about currently “changing people’s lives.” Donalds noted, by “changing people’s lives” the President means paying nearly $500 more monthly for essential goods and services. The congressman asserted that Biden has actually made Americans’ lives worse.Meanwhile, other House Republicans have also criticized the Biden administration’s failing economic policies as inflation continues to be a hot button issue for voters moving into the midterm elections.","Rep.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:55 AM PT – Wednesday, June 15, 2022President Joe Biden has urged several top oil companies to ramp up production while taking aim at refiners for high profits amid soaring gas prices. In a letter to Exonn Mobil, Chevron and five other firms Wednesday, he said the companies must take immediate action to increase the gas and diesel supply.Gas is over $5, rising quickly, and Biden's response is to *mail a letter* to oil companies. What embarrassing impotence from President Biden.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) June 15, 2022The President said refiners historically high profit margins are worsening the intense financial pain the American people are feeling. These remarks came after Biden recently accused oil companies of purposefully curbing supply to raise prices.“Exxon made more money than God this year,” asserted the President. “Any by the way, nothing’s changed. One thing I want to say about the oil companies, they talk about how they have 9,000 permits to drill. They’re not drilling. Why aren’t they drilling? Because they make more money not producing more oil. The price goes up.”Last week, President Biden blamed rising gas prices on America's oil companies, claiming they don't pay taxes & aren’t drilling enough oil. Before that, he tried to blame rising prices on Putin. The only place he hasn't placed blame is where it belongs: his energy policies.— Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) June 14, 2022Biden also informed the companies the federal government is prepared to use all tools and emergency authorities to increase capacity as well as output in the near term.","President Joe Biden walks to the Oval Office of the White House after stepping off Marine One, Tuesday, June 14, 2022, in Washington.

1:09 PM PT",Sen. McConnell slams Democrats for inflation,"Sen. McConnell slams Democrats for inflationFILE – Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, speaks during a news conference in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:09 PM PT – Tuesday, June 14, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recently slammed Democrats for creating the worst inflation in decades. While speaking on the Senate floor Monday, the Kentucky lawmaker said President Joe Biden claimed inflation reached its peak months ago. Since that declaration, however, prices have only increased to their highest points in decades.In particular, McConnell said that prices for gas, food and rent have been particularly inflated. He then pointed out that most Americans are pinching pennies preparing for even greater increases. He said that the money Americans worked hard to earn just isn’t going as far as it once did.“Day by day, all of these painful milestones add up to one simple reality,” stated the Senate Minority Leader. “Americans hard earned dollars just aren’t going nearly as far as they once did. Runaway inflation has swallowed up any shot at rising pay bringing more prosperity.”﻿As far as gas prices go, the Biden administration’s energy outlook forecast for 2022 revealed officials dramatically misunderstood the state of America’s energy supply. According to a Townhall report in December, Biden predicted gas prices would average $2.88 per gallon in 2022.At the beginning of January, however, gas prices were already at $3.13 a gallon and those prices have exceeded $5 a gallon nationally.The pain at the pump is getting worse as gas prices are inching higher by the day. According to the latest data from AAA, national average price of gas is up 15 cents from just last week and more than 55 cents from last month.Meanwhile, Biden has failed to take responsibility for the crisis and has blamed Russia’s Vladimir Putin and COVID-19 instead of his policies. McConnell’s floor speech came as the Wall Street entered a bear market with experts increasingly warning of a recession. On top of that, the May inflation report revealed the highest consumer price index since 1981.","FILE – Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, speaks during a news conference in Louisville, Ky.
