2022-08-01,4:30 PM PT,GOP Sen. John Cornyn positive for COVID-19,"Senator John Cornyn tested positive for COVID-19 despite being vaccinated and boosted. In a tweet Monday, the Texas Republican said he’d been able to “dodge” the virus for more than two years.After dodging it for 2+ years I’ve tested positive for COVID-19. I’m fully vaccinated and boosted, and doing fine. While quarantining I’ll continue to fight Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin’s massive tax increase on working families remotely, consistent with CDC guidelines.— Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) August 1, 2022He then went on to note that his diagnosis could “further complicate the math of floor votes” at the start of a busy week for the Senate. Senate Democrats this week hoped to pass their multi-billion dollar climate, tax and health care package which was announced by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Wednesday. Republicans are expected to unanimously oppose the measure and the GOP has criticized the West Virginia Democrat for backing it.Schumer and Manchin are aiming to pass the package under reconciliation, an arcane budget rule that avoids the senate’s 60-vote threshold required for most bills. Democrats are also closely watching moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) who has not yet announced a position on the reconciliation package.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the Senate majority whip, announced on Thursday that he had tested positive for the virus and it is unclear when he will return to the Capitol.Moving forward, Cornyn said he will continue to work remotely while in isolation.","WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 10: Sen.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:20 PM PT – Monday, August 1, 2022Congressman James Comer (R-Ky.) said he’s looking into Hunter Biden’s questionable foreign dealings. In a recent interview, the Kentucky Congressman said several banks flagged at least 150 financial transactions involving Hunter as suspicious.“Text messages show that Hunter Biden was aware of these SARs and took steps to avoid detection in his financial dealings,” Comer noted.The GOP lawmaker explained this only happens when the bank has solid reasons to believe their client is involved in criminal activity. He added, the Biden administration may be running a cover-up for Hunter.House Oversight Committee Republicans have been investigating the scandal-scarred first son’s domestic and foreign business relationships as well as any effort to benefit from his father. According to the GOP members, the SARs raise “serious questions about what these transactions were for and whether money was transferred to the Biden family from America’s adversaries.”🚨NEW🚨@RepJamesComer presses Hunter Biden’s financial advisor, Edward Prewitt, for information about the Biden family’s foreign business deals that have triggered suspicious activity reports.The American people deserve to know. https://t.co/UwTOzV2uyK— Oversight Committee Republicans (@GOPoversight) July 27, 2022“Committee Republicans are committed to following Hunter Biden’s money trail consisting of many complex, international transactions worth millions of dollars,” stated Comer. “The American people deserve to know the President’s connections to his son’s business deals, which have occurred at the expense of American interests and may represent a national security threat.”According to the Kentucky Congressman, Edward Prewitt and his firm managed the accounts of the first son’s businesses, including Owasco PC, Owasco LLC, Skaneateles and Rosemont Seneca Advisors. They also managed a Hudson West, which has reprotedly been used in transferring millions of dollars to Hunter and James Biden from CEFC. This company has been said to be “effectively an arm of the Chinese government.”WATCH: @RepJamesComer shares new details on the Biden Crime Family:“A suspicious activity report is when the bank notifies the federal government that they have a strong suspicion of criminal activity by their client…Hunter Biden received at least 150 of these.” pic.twitter.com/KnxFXhs5Xe— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) July 30, 2022“You have an obligation to the country to take these allegations seriously, immediately investigate and take steps to institute fixes to these and other matters before you,” the senator voiced to the Biden administration officials.​Comer also said his Oversight Committee is focused on investigating Hunter Biden.

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:10 PM PT – Monday, August 1, 2022The farmer protests have continued in the Netherlands and many are saying Americans should start paying more attention. As tensions rise between farmers and the government in the country, the impacts are being felt across the globe.“I don’t know what could be more essential to communism than that,” said Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a legal philosopher. “So, you know, it’s communism and I’m saying it’s being done on a global scale because this is part of a bigger agenda than just the agenda of the Dutch government.”This week, farmers continued to fight the government’s plans to cut nitrogen emissions by restricting livestock and fertilizer use so heavily that it will send many farms out of business. These plans come after a court ruled the initial emissions plan violated EU laws protecting endangered plants and animals, which caused the Dutch government to target their own farmers.“Yes it’s true that the Dutch government wants the farmers land,” the philosopher voiced. “For one reason is to house new immigrants, but this is also because they are following an agenda called the 2030 agenda. These are restrictions and climate regulations that are imposed all over the world. We’re being hit hardest right now. We might be the first ones, but it’s very important for other people to know they could be coming to you next.”The 2030 plan is an agenda put forth by the United Nations, supposedly to improve many aspects of global peace. One aspect of this agenda is to cut emissions by any means necessary which will cause backlash among those affected.“We already see now that in Italy farmers have gone out on the street as well,” she stated. “In Poland farmers are going out. So it’s spilling over which is a really good sign because like I said these restrictions are going to be very relevant for everyone because obviously it’s a global agenda.”As I drive through the Netherland countryside, I see massive hay stacks of loose hay piled up adjacent to highways. It must have been part of the plan, because with a quick tractor push and lighter, the highways are ablaze. Farmers are not going gently. pic.twitter.com/0LaiMoYNYQ— Keean Bexte 🇳🇱 (@TheRealKeean) July 7, 2022The agenda was recently implemented in Sri Lanka where the government banned chemical fertilizers which caused a food shortage and economic crisis to erupt across the country. This resulted in the ouster of the government. With so many other countries already experiencing similar restrictions some said it is only a matter of time before American farmers start becoming affected.If enacted in America, the restrictions would likely force mass culling of livestock, use of synthetic fertilizers and end with many farmers losing their business and land all together. There are no plans to go as far as The Netherlands in the US currently, but Democrats have recently passed an anti-energy spending spree which gives over $300 billion to so-called green energy technologies. They claim these technologies will reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030. This will line up with the UN’s agenda target date.","Protesting farmers block a drawbridge at locks in the Princess Margriet canal, preventing all ship traffic from passing in Gaarkeuken, northern Netherlands, Monday, July 4, 2022.

According to CBS News’ “battleground tracker,” the GOP would secure 230 seats in the House this November while Democrats would hold 205 seats. The poll found Republicans would get 12 seats more than the 218 required to control the lower chamber.Meanwhile, a rising number of voters are leaning Republican in upcoming midterms due to economic recession, runaway inflation and other Democrat policy failures. Republicans are expecting a much larger red wave that is predicted by this poll.“Well, they are afraid of us,” stated Kari Lake, (R) Arizona gubernatorial candidate. “They thought that when they stole that election in 2020 they made Donald Trump, the America First movement and all the patriots go away. That we would just crawl off and never return, but we’re emboldened.

When she spoke to Breitbart on Monday, she said that anybody who is serious about reducing the size of the federal government should get on board with cutting the Education Department. DeVos suggested this idea must be a central tenet of the Republican party platform.According to the former Education Secretary, the bureaucracy does what it can to work against the interests of the people. She claimed the department was started in the 70s due to a corrupt political bargain. Since then, she feels it has only been used to increase the power of teachers’ unions and other self-interested groups.“I just think about the experience in the Department of Education and how formidable the bureaucracy is,” explained DeVos. “And how difficult it is to advance policy in an environment where the vast majority of the individuals are actually working against you.” DeVos went on to say that she wants to see education policy returned to the United States.","WASHINGTON, DC – MARCH 28: U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos testifies during a Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee discussing proposed budget estimates and justification for FY2020 for the Education Department on March 28, 2019 in Washington, DC.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:20 PM PT – Tuesday, August 2, 2022Texas resident Guy Reffitt is sentenced to seven years for his part in the US Capitol protest on January 6, which is the longest sentence for a defendant yet. He was sentenced to multiple years behind bars, despite never once entering the Capitol Building.Back in March, he was convicted of carrying a gun on US Capitol grounds. Prosecutors demanded a 15-year sentence and to designate Reffitt as a terrorist, but the judge refused while citing he never unholstered his firearm.Reffitt’s wife, Nicole, said that she wasn’t surprised and asserted that her husband is just the start of political persecution.“If we allow our country to keep being driven into the ground by the corrupt, evil politicians here in this city, then one day at your kitchen table the FBI is going to come in and tell you that you stood up at the school board meeting and you are now a domestic terrorist,” she told the media. “So wake up, America. This isn’t just about Guy Wesley Reffitt. This isn’t about just 1/6. This is about our liberties being stomped on.”Reffitt was turned in by his son, who accused his father of threatening him and his sister if they went to the police, which the jury convicted Reffitt of doing as well. His has said he absolutely agrees with the verdict.","Nicole Reffitt talks to reporters outside of federal court in Washington, Tuesday, March 8, 2022.

Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:17 AM PT – Tuesday, August 2, 2022President Joe Biden has tapped a FEMA official to lead his administration’s monkeypox response team amid states of emergency across the country. On Tuesday, the White House named regional coordinator Robert Fenton as the response team’s coordinator and CDC official Dr. Demetre Daskalakis as deputy coordinator.Fenton and Dr. Daskalakis, an expert on health issues affecting the LGBTQ community, will be tasked with spearheading strategy to address the ongoing outbreak. This as comes as California, Illinois and New York have all declared states of emergency as cases rise. The White House has not said if the administration plans to declare a health emergency on a national scale.“So when it comes to a public health emergency, that is a decision that that is made by Secretary Becerra,” stated White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “That is not made by the president. But, as you know, we are considering every policy option to help end this outbreak that is urgent and that is important to us. But again, that is up to Secretary Sarah to make that decision.” Three House Democrats recently requesed a review of the federal government’s response to monkeypox. Representatives Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Richie Torres (D-N.Y.) and Val Demings (D-Fla.) wrote a letter to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on Monday.The three Democrats asked the agency to conduct a review of the response due to concerns about the virus spreading over the past two months because of delays in procuring tests as well as vaccines. The letter also included a request for the GAO to figure out if any agencies learned anything from the response of the COVID-19 pandemic.House Homeland Security Chair @BennieGThompson, @valdemings, and I are calling on @USGAO to investigate the federal government’s delayed response to the Monkeypox outbreak. The US should spare no effort to secure the homeland from infectious disease. https://t.co/plEonSBXBm— Ritchie Torres (@RitchieTorres) August 2, 2022According the CDC, there are now more than 5,000 cases of monkeypox in the US. The virus has been detected in 47 states with Montana, Vermont and Wyoming being the only three with zero cases reported. California and New York are leading in case numbers, while Illinois trails behind them in third.President Joe Biden is receiving pressure from Democrat House lawmakers to declare a public health emergency amid the rising number in cases across the country. In the meantime, Fenton and Dr. Daskalakis will be working on increasing the availability of testing and vaccines.","FILE – Committee chairman Rep.

(Appalshop via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:05 AM PT – Tuesday, August 2, 2022Extreme flooding wreaked havoc in Kentucky, prompting a response from the state’s top Republican in Congress. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R- Ky.) delivered updates on the ongoing tragedy in his home state on the Senate floor on Monday.McConnell said the horrible tragedy is far from over and mentioned that records are being broken. He highlighted the fact that some counties in Kentucky are completely submerged in water. So far, the flooding has ravaged 13 counties.“In Jackson, waters reached 43 and a half feet high breaking an 83 year old record,” explained the senator. “Drone footage shows whole towns completely submerged. Roadways have turned into rivers. Rising waters have reached rooftops.”The National Guard has been called in to assist first responders for the declared state of emergency.“Our heroic first responders, including the National Guard from Kentucky and surrounding states, are working overtime to find and recover stranded residents.” McConnell explained. “They rescued more than 1,400 individuals in floodwaters hill. Nearly half of the rescues were by air.”Some believe the recovery time could take several months and possibly even years. However, the Republican is confident in the resiliency of Kentuckians and believes the state will bounce back.More heavy rainfall is expected to hit Kentucky throughout the week.","This July 28, 2022 photo provided by Appalshop shows the flooded Appalshop building in Whitesburg, Ky.

(AP Photo/Mazhar Ali Khan, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:32 AM PT – Tuesday, August 2, 2022The White House announced the death of a prominent figure in Al-Qaeda. President Joe Biden confimred the successful killing of terrorist leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri. In a Monday press conference, the President said Zawahiri was killed by a drone strike over the weekend in the Afghan capitol of Kabul.“After relentlessly seeking Zawahri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump, our Intelligence Community located Zawahri earlier this year,” Biden stated. “He’d moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. After carefully considering clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians.”Zawahiri played a prominent role in the organization by acting as Osama Bin Laden’s second-in-command before taking over as their leader after the death of Bin Laden in 2011. He was also reportedly involved in the planning of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center as well as bombings at two US embassies in Africa that claimed the lives of 224 people.“He was deeply involved in the planning of 9/11,” said Biden. “One of the most responsible for the attacks and murdered 2,977 people on American soil. For decades, he was the mastermind behind attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more. He played a key role in the bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others.”Biden then went on to say that he will be continuing to address threats from the organization despite the death of Zawahiri.“My administration will continue to vigilantly monitor and address threats from Al-Qaeda, no matter where they emanate from,” he noted. “As Commander-in-Chief, it is my solemn responsibility to make America safe in a dangerous world. The United States did not seek this war against terror. It came to us. We answered with the same principles of resolve that have shaped us for generation upon generation, to protect the innocent, defend liberty and we keep the light of freedom burning a beacon for the rest of the entire world.”Today, and every day, I am grateful to the superb patriots who serve in the United States intelligence and counterterrorism community.It is thanks to their extraordinary persistence and skill that this operation was a success – they have made us all safer. pic.twitter.com/OUARNt1Kdv— President Biden (@POTUS) August 2, 2022The operation marked the first publicly announced CIA strike in Afghanistan since  Biden’s botched withdrawal of US forces last year. Zawahiri’s death comes as a heavy blow to international terrorism and it may reduce competition between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the Afghan powerplay.Senior Taliban figures were reportedly aware of Zawahiri’s presence in the area. They even took steps to conceal his presence after Saturday’s successful strike by restricting access to the safe house and rapidly relocating members of his family, including his daughter and her children who were intentionally not targeted during the strike and remained unharmed. The US did not alert Taliban officials ahead of Saturday’s strike.","FILE – In this 1998 file photo made available on March 19, 2004, Ayman al-Zawahri poses for a photograph in Khost, Afghanistan.

(AP Photo/Andres Kudacki)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:54 AM PT – Tuesday, August 2, 2022A video of former President Bill Clinton defining a recession was highlighted by GOP lawmakers as the Biden administration attempts to redefine the term. Sen. Ted Cruz (R- Texas) posted the video of Clinton on Saturday with the comment ”Bill Clinton was right.”Bill Clinton was right. https://t.co/bZtObFlJji— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) July 31, 2022The video from December 2000 shows the former President defining recession by its common definition after being asked about his fears of an oncoming recession. This quote resurged decades later as the Biden administration refused to describe the current state of the economy as being in a recession. Despite last weeks GDP report, which showed a second consecutive quarter of negative growth, the administration has attempted to redefine the qualifications needed for a recession.Meanwhile, a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D- Calif) talking about the “technical definition of recession” has reemerged from July 2008. The video, which resurfaced after last weeks GDP report release, also shows the top Democrat agreeing two quarters of negative growth does, in fact, suggest there is a recession. Pelosi is now distancing herself from her previous definition and is trying to downplay the current state of the economy under President Biden.Nancy Pelosi in July 2008: The “technical definition of recession” is two quarters of negative growth pic.twitter.com/JNhzNbgTXa— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 29, 2022 The 45th President also chimed in on the matter while taking to his social media app, Truth Social. Donald Trump suggested the Democrat proposed tax increase would violate Biden’s promises. He noted, “Big Tax increase for all Americans being pushed by Democrats. This is the opposite of the Biden pledge!”His statement comes after a senatorial committee on taxation discovered that taxes would rise for people making $30,000 and up per year. This comes despite Biden’s previous promises that taxes would only increase for top earners. Trump believes that the tax increase is coming amid an economic recession and that an increase would lead US manufactures to flee the country, which would result in Americans suffering even more.","A man shops at a supermarket on Wednesday, July 27, 2022, in New York.

Supporters call the measure “Value Them Both,” arguing that it protects both unborn children and the women carrying them. Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Kansas and Missouri all have personhood laws. (AP Photo/John Hanna, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:31 AM PT – Tuesday, August 2, 2022For the first time since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, Kansas citizens will have their opportunity to make it known how they feel about abortion. On Tuesday, the people of Kansas will vote on the Value them Both Amendment. If the amendment is passed, it would declare there is no right to an abortion in the state while also allowing the state legislature to write laws on the issue.Following a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling, abortion became a constitutional right under the state constitution. Legislators can only legislate on the issue if the state “has a compelling and narrow interest” in the regulation. This has meant the furthest the state has been able to go in banning the procedure is a 22-week gestation limit and a 24-hour waiting period.POLLS ARE OPEN ACROSS KANSAS! Today is the day. Get out and vote YES on #ValueThemBoth! Find your polling location here >> https://t.co/kACq4xSb2u pic.twitter.com/RG0xeJHled— Value Them Both (@ValueThemBoth) August 2, 2022According to pro-life activists, the ruling as it currently exists will open the door for unlimited abortion and the repeal of existing restrictions.“So in 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court basically cleared the path to unlimited abortion in our state’s constitution by discovering a nearly unlimited right to abortion,” said Peter Northcott, Executive Director of Kansans for Life. “So now, every single one of our pro life laws, from parental notifications to our bans on taxpayer funded abortions are now in danger of being struck down.”Pro-abortion activist and former Governor Kathleen Sebelius (D- Kan.) claimed state Republicans structured the referendum to be confusing and set it for a primary because they know Democrats are less likely to turn out.“The amendment is very confusing,” explained. “It’s written in a very convoluted way and it takes a lot of explanation. And the legislature specifically chose what they thought would be the very lowest turnout election possible.”On the ground activists have confidence that ‘no’ will prevail more than Democrat politicians. One activist from the ‘no’ side, Jessica Roland, believes that most Americans support abortion access and the referendum will prove that it doesn’t stop at the Kansas border.“The majority of Americans do feel that abortion should be legal, so we’ve gotta get you out there and we’ve gotta get your voice heard,” she asserted. “We’re just trying to build a community, and change some hearts and minds if we can.”Polling has been scant. Based off a poll that was taken a few weeks ago, however, it’s expected that it could be a tight race for the amendment. Forty-seven percent of potential voters said they’d vote yes and 43 percent said they’d vote ‘no.’ The remaining 10 percent in the balance is undecided. Early voter turnout has also reportedly shattered expectations. The pro-choice side sees that as an indication that the amendment will go down in defeat.We FEEL the energy heading into Election Day! 🔥Our grassroots team and @sbaprolife student canvassers rallied this morning before heading out to meet Kansans to encourage them to vote YES on #ValueThemBoth! pic.twitter.com/7VDwI5PDpn— Value Them Both (@ValueThemBoth) July 30, 2022Despite the headwinds and high court rulings, pro-life Kansans are confident that on Tuesday, Kansas will become the first state to value both the mother and her baby in the womb through referendum.","FILE – In this photo from Friday, July 8, 2022, a sign in a yard in Olathe, Kansas, promotes a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to allow legislators to further restrict or ban abortion.
