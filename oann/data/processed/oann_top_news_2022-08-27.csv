On Tuesday night, the US central command (CENTCOM) confirmed a series of successful precision air-strikes in Syria targeting terrorists with ties to the Iranian Guards Corps.Statement Regarding Precision Strikes in Syriahttps://t.co/ED69Xq0tm3 pic.twitter.com/hpWw1NNMNV— U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM) August 24, 2022Reports said guided bomb units were dropped from four F-15s and F-16s. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby commended the move. He stressed that the strikes were necessary to prevent future attacks on American troops.“As you heard from CENTCOM, these strikes were a direct response to attacks and ongoing threats against U.S. forces by Iran-backed groups, just like the ones we saw on August 15th,” said Kirby. “As before, we don’t seek escalation, but we remain prepared to respond to any ongoing threat. We took this action because the President determined it was in our national interest to do so.”Kirby also touched on the developing talks between European, Iranian and American diplomats regarding the resurrection of the 2015 nuclear deal. Israeli officials, including its current Prime Minister and last two Prime Minsters, have all come out against America agreeing to the deal. They all warned of the devastating impact the deal would have on Israel. I just spoke with my friend, President @EmmanuelMacron.We discussed the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.Iran cannot be allowed to endlessly buy time and receive more concessions while it advances its nuclear program and spreads terror worldwide. pic.twitter.com/HN6cOEx6d6— יאיר לפיד – Yair Lapid (@yairlapid) August 22, 2022נלחם בתקשורת האמריקנית נגד הסכם הגרעין המסוכן עם איראן >> pic.twitter.com/t7u2RoqkeU— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) August 24, 2022I call on @POTUS Biden & the US administration to refrain, even now at this last minute, from signing the agreement with Iran.

That’s why we’re so focused on a diplomatic outcome to that, to see that result in a return to the JCPOA. But I think it’s important to be clear whether or not we reach a return to the JCPOA, the president’s commitment to protect U.S. personnel and confront Iran’s malign behaviors in the region that jeopardize our people or our friends will stay unwavering.”Meanwhile, on the Ukraine front, the Biden administration is looking to fork over another three-billion-dollars worth of military aid to the country to celebrate the sixth month mark of the crisis with Russia. Reports say that the military industrial complex has already contributed $10-point-six-billion worth of equipment to Ukraine. Kirby embattled former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and many members of the United Nations Security council who decried Russia’s efforts in Ukraine. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, shared her support for country.“Let’s be clear. The international community will never recognize Russia’s attempt to change Ukraine’s borders by force,” Thomas-Greenfield said. Meanwhile, recent analyses of Joe Biden’s handling of foreign policy, has concluded that his method has been destructive to the international community and to America’s image on the world stage.  Former Trump administration Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, David Schenker, combated the Biden administration’s assertion that the Middle East is the most stable it’s been in years. Schenker pointed out that Iraq has fallen prey to the influence of Iranian terrorists and bolstering the Ayatollah’s geo-political position in the region. Additionally, other experts ingrained in the fabric of America’s foreign policy, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, have lamented that America’s foreign policy now has no compass, predicting a greater war with Russia and China could come about if the Biden administration keeps course.","President Joe Biden waves after returning to the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022.

2022-08-25,"Daniel Baldwin, OAN White House Correspondent
1:24 PM PT",Richard Baris: It’s Clear GOP Voters Not Ready to Move On From Trump,"Richard Baris: It’s Clear GOP Voters Not Ready to Move On From TrumpDaniel Baldwin, OAN White House CorrespondentUPDATED 1:24 PM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022Democrat Pat Ryan claimed victory in a special election in a bellwether district in New York’s Hudson Valley Tuesday evening. While many election pundits are citing this win as a signal of a dying red wave, Richard Baris, the director of Big Data Poll, says there is no other way to spin it.“I think it’s significant that the Democrats won that seat,” Baris said. Pat Ryan beat Mullinaro. There’s no way to spin that otherwise.” Baris did note turnout in this special election was down by about 200,000 votes from the historical norm. Baris says New York’s 19th Congressional District usually draws about 350,000 votes. For example, in the 2020 general election, this same district drew a total of 352,771 votes. But Tuesday evening, only 128,991 people turned in their ballot to vote. Baris says this is a sign the GOP is struggling to move the needle without former President Donald Trump on the ballot. “What this tells me in New York 19 is that without Donald Trump involved in some of these fights,” Baris explained. “Whether he is trying to beat a more establishment candidate in a nomination, or his candidate is just favored and he’s, he’s there driving excitement up, Republicans are having a hard time on their own getting people excited.”President Joe Biden carried New York 19 by less than 2 percentage points in 2020. Ryan claimed 51.1% (65,943) of the vote with Molinaro only securing 48.8% (62,952). Ryan is an Ulster County executive and will only serve four months in the current district. Baris says Molinaro should have won this seat.“[He] did about as well in Dutchess County, which is his own backyard, Biden won that area,” Baris explained. “He did about as well as any Republican could have. We have to remember that the district still did swing about 11 points in favor of Republicans. And the fact is Democrats can’t afford that in many of these districts across the country.”Baris says the big takeaway from the race is that the GOP is struggling to turn out the vote without the 45th president.“The big picture for me is that without Donald Trump on that ballot, they have a hard time bringing out lower propensity working class people who are not sold on the Republican party,” said Baris. “This idea of moving on from Donald Trump, [the voters] not ready to do that yet. It’s clear.”TOPICS:Big Data PollDonald TrumpDutchess CountyelectionNew YorknewsOANOANNPat RyanpoliticsREPUBLICANSRichard BarisVOTING SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/richard-baris-its-clear-gop-voters-not-ready-to-move-on-from-trump/

The board held termination hearings to decide the employment fate of Uvalde School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:05 PM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022Members of the Uvalde school board voted to remove Police Chief Pete Arredondo over his response to the Robb Elementary Shooting. The unanimous vote has terminated the contract of the disgraced Police Chief.During a meeting on Wednesday, the school board secretary Laura Perez made the motion to remove Arredondo from his position. Her motion received an overwhelming amount of support from members of the board.Prior to this, Arredondo had already turned in his resignation letter after being heavily criticized for his actions during the shooting incident at Robb Elementary which left 21 people dead including 19 children.“Mister Board President, I move that good cause exist to terminate the non-certified contract of Pete Arredondo effectively immediately,” said Perez. “I further move that good cause exist to ratify the unpaid leave status of Mister Arredondo starting July 19, 2022. Finally I move to authorize the superintendent to issue written notice to Mister Arredondo of this board action including filing any needed reports required by the termination.”Members of the community were left unsatisfied despite the decision to strip the school district Police Chief of his title. Robb Elementary student, Caitlyn Gonzalez, lambasted the police who were present at the school during the incident saying they ‘don’t reserve to wear a badge’.Before Uvalde CISD voted to fire Pete Arredondo, a young Uvalde girl demanded that law enforcement who responded at Robb ""turn in your badge and step down."" https://t.co/OJRzBkMxQY pic.twitter.com/LDiSBaSVWP— KENS 5 (@KENS5) August 25, 2022“I have messages for Pete Arredondo and all the law enforcement that were there that day: turn in your badge, and step down,” said Gonzalez. “You don’t deserve to wear one.”Another Uvalde resident, Daniel Myers, expressed his outrage at the school board. He accused them of not caring about the families who were affected by the tragedy. Myers also believes the board was trying to cover up the incident by dismissing Arredondo.“You guys don’t care a squawk about these families,” claimed Meyers. “If it was one of your children, hands would be rolling right now. But because it’s not, you don’t care. You are not going to sweep this under the rug. You’re not. All of you are accountable.”In the meantime, several government agencies including the FBI have launched investigations into the police response to the shooting.","Texas Department of Safety Troopers stand by for a meeting of the Board of Trustees of Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas.

I wish this country had two normal political parties so we can debate should the taxes be 18 percent or 19 percent. But that’s not what we debate anymore. We debate crazy things. Insanity”Rubio said that the country is so polarized because America’s two major political parties share no common ground. He claimed that while Republicans hold the United States in high regard, the Democrats hate the core values of America and wish to destroy it. The Senator declared the fight for the nation is not over. He called on still patriotic Democrats to help save America.“And when we win in November, we’re going to put a stop to this destruction,” the Senator said. “And then, God willing, in two years, someone will be in the White House that isn’t this guy, with common sense, with an understanding about America’s future, that believes in the greatness of our country. And we will save our country and we will leave for our children what our parents, what our grandparents, what previous Americans left for us: the single greatest country in the history of all of mankind. We need to go win and we need your help”.Rubio will face off against Trump’s impeachment manager, representative Val Demings, in order to retain his seat this November.","Republican Senator from Florida Marco Rubio speaks during a rally in support of Republican gubernatorial incumbent Gov.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks to members of the press at Russell Senate Office Building March 24, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:32 AM PT – Thursday, August 25, 2022The looming agreement of another Iran nuclear deal is mobilizing critics from around the world who are trying to block the deal from being enforced. As European diplomats are close to inking a nuclear deal with Iran, critics vow to make sure an agreement doesn’t see the light of day. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R- Texas) stressed that Iran is not an actor that negotiates in good faith. The Texas Republican pointed out that Iran is trying to hunt down American officials and dissidents on US soil and that they even failed to comply with the standards imposed during the 2015 Obama era deal. He went on to note that a new deal would empower the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps to continue carrying out terrorist activities in Yemen and Israel. Cruz claimed it would lift the sanction that President Trump imposed on the rogue state and that a new deal could instead pump trillions-of-dollars into its economy.Complete horse manure.The Iran nuclear deal is designed to let the Ayatollah cheat his way to a nuclear arsenal.These so-called ""most rigorous and intensive"" inspections failed in the last deal – and will be even weaker this time.Let's review the actual facts. 🧵 1/X https://t.co/8hWVD4Hy3y— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) August 24, 2022Additionally, Cruz warned that the new agreement would allow Iran to have a nuclear arsenal, something that he’s been adamant against since the Obama administration. “President Biden wants nothing more than to re-enter a deal that is even worse than the Obama deal,” claimed Cruz. “In Vienna, Biden diplomats have been furiously bending over backwards to surrender to the Ayatollah. The same Ayatollah who is a theocratic despot regularly chants ‘death to America’ and ‘death to Israel.’ This administration wants nothing more than to give them hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Money that will inevitably be used to number one to murder Americans, Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and number two to develop nuclear weapons.”Meanwhile, Israel set up meetings with the White House to argue their side of the debate. On Tuesday, Israel’s National Security Advisor met with his counterpart Jake Sullivan in Washington to make it known to Joe Biden that its strongest ally in the Middle East has real concerns with the deal. This comes ahead of a meeting between Sullivan and Israel’s Defense Minister Benny Gantz. The two are scheduled to talk on Friday. Former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, said he hopes Biden hears his calls to back away from the deal. Bennett stressed that his country could face dire consequences. I call on @POTUS Biden & the US administration to refrain, even now at this last minute, from signing the agreement with Iran. This agreement will send approximately a quarter of a trillion dollars to the Iranian terror administration's pocket and to its regional proxies, >>— Naftali Bennett בנט (@naftalibennett) August 23, 2022“There are those who think they deserve to have their sanctions removed and hundreds of billions of dollars poured right into their rotten regime. They’re wrong,” Bennett said. “Iran deserves no rewards, no bargain deals and no sanctions relief in return for their brutality.”However, the State Department maintained that it will not back down from its mission to accomplish its main foreign policy goal since occupying the executive branch. State Department Spokesperson, Ned Price, said diplomats will keep trying to convince Americans that a return to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is much needed to secure America’s national security interest. Price said there are still issues Iran needs to air out, including not giving answers to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) probe into undeclared traces of enriched uranium in its nuclear facility. “Iran needs to answer the IAEA’s questions,” said Price. “This is the only way to address these issues once and for all. Our position is not going to change regardless of where we express it – in the text of an understanding, a mutual return to full information of the JCPOA in public or elsewhere. We are… unbending in our support of the IAEA, in support of the IAEA mandates and the independence of the IAEA that is core to that mandate.”In the meantime, it seems the Biden administration is waiting to respond to criticisms of agreeing to a deal with Iran until after the meetings with Israeli officials. Iran issued a written statement to the European Union last week signaling an end to negotiations, but American diplomats decried some of the proposals calling them impossible. The Biden administration has yet to respond to Iran’s proposal which is casting a shadow of uncertainty around the deal. ","WASHINGTON, DC – MARCH 24: U.S. Sen.

The Nevada County Sheriff-Coroner has identified the decedent as 16-year-old Kiely Rodni, of Truckee.  More info: https://t.co/a18rag5KH0 pic.twitter.com/uvXFV7WbO3— Nevada County Sheriff's Office (@NevCoSheriff) August 23, 2022The Truckee 16-year-old was reported missing after attending a party with hundreds of people on August sixth at Prosser Family Campground. Her disappearance led local, state and federal agencies to spend about 20,000 man-hours searching the area. Adventures With Purpose, a private group of divers, located Rodnis’ vehicle near the campground. Her car was upside down and submerged 14-feet underwater. It was located about 55-feet offshore. Doug Bishop, a representative of Adventures With Purpose, released a statement on the group’s Youtube channel. “We understand that the resource we provide with our unique skill set is rare,” said Bishop. “It is an honor to help agencies and families all across the nation.”Before their discovery, other teams sent by authorities had already searched the lake several times prior. When asked about how officials weren’t able to locate her car in areas that had already been searched, Nevada County Deputy Sheriff Sam Brown spoke to reporters. “How did we not find it when we were searching? The lake was extensively searched…” explained Brown. “We had divers, we had swimmers. I think that’s part of what we’re going to have to go back to do and debrief.”Local police said they’re going to look at how they can improve its resources and review strategies for deep water searches. Further details such as the cause of death have not been released. A toxicology report could take four-to-six weeks.

Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) August 25, 2022While speaking with the Taiwanese President on Friday, Blackburn referred to the island as a country, a move experts say could irk the Chinese Communist Party. Blackburn’s surprise visit to the island comes amid China aggressively demanding that the international community should recognize Taiwan as a part of China’s mainline. Blackburn stressed that China is just trying to see if it can push over Taiwan without setting off an international crisis. “Xi Jinping and his military leaders are not prone to making sour of the moment decisions they planned for this moment. And they were just waiting for an excuse to bully Taiwan,” the Senator said. “They are clearly testing Taiwan’s resolve and the rest of the world’s tolerance for even more imperialist violence.”The Tennessee Republican is the latest US lawmaker to visit the island. She joined the ranks of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other members of Congress who recently visited Taiwan. In the meantime, Blackburn urged the Biden administration to help America’s ally defend itself from Chinese aggression. She also added that Chinese President, Xi Jinping, doesn’t scare her. I will continue to stand with the Taiwans and their right to freedom and democracy.Xi Jinping doesn’t scare me.— Sen.

After Friday’s release of the affidavit, the Department of Justice (DOJ) justified the redactions in the document. The DOJ claimed that disclosing certain information would hamper its pursuit of evidence.#BREAKING The redacted affidavit regarding FBI raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate has been releasedhttps://t.co/j9c9q8w2xR— Stephanie Myers (@_StephanieMyers) August 26, 2022The unredacted part of the documents showed that the FBI believed there was probable cause that national security documents were still at Mar-a-Lago after a prior request to hand them over. According to the affidavit, the FBI also believed they would find evidence of obstruction of justice at the Florida property. Former President Trump has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the investigation into the documents.Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ordered the document be made public by noon eastern on Friday. Reinhart made the decision on Thursday. He said that the DOJ did not meet the burden of proving that the entire document should stay sealed. Former President Donald Trump had called for the affidavit’s full release. Trump’s spokesperson believes that Democrat officials use redactions to hide their own corruption, claiming that it’s similar to what they did with the debunked Russia hoax.

McCabe, National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 3:55 PM PT – Friday, August 26, 2022DALLAS Conservatives at the CPAC held in Dallas, got a unique glimpse into the suffering of Jan. 6, participants targeted by federal law enforcement when WalkAway Campaign founder walked through the halls and exhibits in an orange jumpsuit as if in custody—leading a crowd to a jail cell.“I think that most people in the conservative movement through no faults of their own, don’t really fully understand what’s happening to their own fellow citizens,” said Brandon Straka, who started his movement for disgusted Democrats after President Donald J. Trump was elected, and he saw how the media and Democratic leaders misrepresented him.“These J6 investigations and FBI raids and overcharging and abuse from the judicial system, which is totally out of hand. I mean, totally, totally out of hand,” Straka said.The former professional hairdresser said he went to the Capitol that day after friends texted him about what was going on and he wanted to see it for himself, but he never actually entered the building.“I walked up the steps, the doors were open and I stood there for eight minutes and I filmed people entering the building, and I uploaded the video that I shot to Twitter, you know, not really thinking much of it,” he said.“Then, about two and a half weeks later, uh, the FBI raided my house, and I was charged with multiple felonies,” he said.“I was taken to jail over what ultimately ended up being a misdemeanor charge,” Straka said.“They took me in, I was made to take all my clothes off in front of a stranger who took my clothes away and brought me back an orange jumpsuit—and when I put it on, I looked down at myself and the first thing I felt was just complete shame,” he said.During his more than one hour behind bars in the cell next to the WalkAway CPAC booth, Straka received a surprise visit from Micki Witthoeft, Ashli Babbitt’s mother who joined him in the cell.The unarmed Babbitt was shot and killed Jan. 6, 2021, in the hallway outside the Speakers Lobby by a Capitol Hill police officer.Witthoeft said she admires Straka and she is grateful for his advocacy for all the J6 families.“It’s been a life-altering experience, not just for me, but for so many people for Brandon, for his mom, for his dad, for, for everyone around him. You know, and, and that’s true of every Jan. 6 family it’s touched him in, in such an awful way,” she said.Straka accepted a plea deal for one misdemeanor count, and a punishment that included a $5,000 fine, and three years probation, but he said he knows many of the J6 defendants got worse than him.“Jan. 6, at this point, has almost come to represent the left’s narrative as a large hammer to pound conservatives down with,” he said.“I think that through the process of that politicization, the prisoners have been, have been forgotten.”",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Zuckerberg: Facebook Suppressed Hunter Biden Laptop Story Ahead Of 2020 ElectionTOPICS:barsCapitolJ6jailnewsOANOANNpoliticsTrumpWASHINGTON SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/walkaway-founder-brandon-straka-recreates-jailing-to-raise-awareness-of-j6-prisoners/

We thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically, there’s about to be some kind of dump that’s similar to that,” said Zuckerberg. “So, just be vigilant.”As a result, when the New York Post released its story on Hunter Biden’s laptop, Facebook intentionally suppressed distribution of the story.“Distribution on Facebook was decreased, but people were still allowed to share it,” Zuckerberg said. “So, you can still share it. You can still consume it.”Zuckerberg explained the end result was “fewer people” seeing the article “than would have otherwise.” He says the FBI’s approach to Facebook spurred the company to action.“We just kind of thought, Hey look, if the FBI, which, you know, I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, it’s a very professional law enforcement,” Zuckerberg told Rogan. “They come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something. Then I want to take that seriously.”However, Zuckerberg admitted the FBI did not specifically tell Facebook the Hunter Biden laptop story was the “Russian propaganda” it was referring to, but he said the story “basically fit the pattern.”Zuckerberg went to say he regretted Facebook’s involvement when the story was proven to be factually accurate.“When something like [the Hunter Biden laptop story] turns out to be real, is there regret for not having it evenly distributed,” Rogan asked.“It sucks,” Zuckerberg responded.Zuckerberg compared the situation to that of an innocent man going through a trial.“I think it probably sucks though in the same way that probably having to go through like a criminal trial, but being proven innocent in the end, sucks,” Zuckerberg explained. “Like it still sucks that you had to go through a criminal trial, but at the end, you’re free. So I don’t know what the answer would have been. Don’t do anything, or don’t have any process? I think the process was pretty reasonable. We still let people share it.

Kathy Hochul speaks at True Bethel Baptist Church on Sunday, May 15, 2022, in Buffalo, N.Y. (AP Photo/Joshua Bessex)By Caitlin Sinclair10:30 AM PT – Friday, August 26, 2022Gov. Kathy Hochul spent the last night before Election Day using a new campaign tactic– encouraging GOP voters to leave the state of New York.“Jump on a bus and head down to Florida where you belong,” Gov. Hochul lambasted her opponent, Lee Zeldin, and other Republicans on Monday night — implying anyone who is not a supporter, therefore, “is not a New Yorker.” This reminds us of the time Joe Biden told black voters they “ain’t black” if they were considering voting for former President Donald Trump.“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump then you ain’t black,” Mr. Biden said in 2020.Hochul for the second time in recent weeks used her platform to play into national party politics by attacking the state of Florida. Yet, it is Hochul’s own decisions and policies that actually have New Yorkers envious of the sunshine state.The biggest disconnect: Crime. Voters throughout the state in recent public polling have ranked crime and public safety concerns as top issues. Congressman Lee Zeldin made those issues centerpieces of his campaign. Hochul, meanwhile, has not offered insights into new future priorities or an agenda for what a full next term as governor would include, instead indicating that she would continue to implement and deepen policies and programs already underway. The same programs Big Apple residents find disastrous.….These recent comments were the second time in less than two weeks she has taken a swing at Florida. At a Holocaust-education bill-signing earlier this month, she thanked the state’s 1.77 million Jews for “calling New York home. Don’t go anywhere or to another state. Florida is overrated. I shouldn’t say this, but look at the governor. It starts at the top down,” she said.The state Republican Party sent a fundraising email on Tuesday that featured Hochul’s recent comments. “This year we must send Kathy Hochul and the Democrats a giant message that we aren’t going anywhere. Not only are we NOT leaving, we’re going to take our state back from the corrupt, disastrous Democrats who are destroying New York,” the email said.Afterall, according to Kathy Hochul’s standards, wanting a safe city with a thriving economy doesn’t qualify you as a “real New Yorker.” That is alright Kath…. us GOP’ers  will leave and take our tax money. You can have the illegals, the crime, and the poor quality of life.TOPICS:Donald TrumpFloridaGOPkathy hochulLee ZeldinNew York SHARETWEETPINSHARE","New York Gov.

Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart announced Thursday that the Department if Justice did not meet the burden of showing the entire document should stay sealed. Reinhart ordered the “redacted” version of the affidavit to be made public by noon Friday.Former President Donald Trump has called for the affidavit’s full release with his spokesperson saying, “Democrat officials use redactions to hide their own corruption just like they did with the debunked Russia hoax.”Trump has continued to suggest Joe Biden did know about the raid of Mar- a-Lago. While taking to Truth Social Thursday, Trump questioned if people really believed the President was unaware of “the greatest political attack in the history of the US.” His remarks came after Biden told reporters Wednesday that he had no advance notice about the raid.The Radical Left Democrat prosecutors are illegally trying to circumvent, for purely political gain, the Presidential Record’s Act, under which I have done absolutely nothing wrong. It can not be circumvented, for me or any other President. They illegally Raided my home, and took things that should not have been taken. They even broke into my safe, an unthinkable act!— Donald Trump via Truth SocialIn a separate post, Trump said Democrat prosecutors are illegally trying to circumvent the Presidential Record’s Act for purely political gain. He contended he has done absolutely nothing wrong and authorities took things from his home that should not have been taken.Meanwhile, Biden has continued to insist he did not know about the FBI raid of Trump’s home until after it happened. While speaking to reporters Wednesday, Biden said he had no advance notice about the raid, echoing prior remarks by White House officials.However, Republicans believe the unprecedented raid must have been approved at the highest level and Biden must have at least known about it. They argue if it wasn’t then it means the Department of Justice has gone rogue. Meanwhile, members of the GOP say if the raid was approved by Biden then it is, indeed, a politically-motivated attack.","WASHINGTON, DC – NOVEMBER 13: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about Operation Warp Speed in the Rose Garden at the White House on November 13, 2020 in Washington, DC.
