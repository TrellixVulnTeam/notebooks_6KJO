A recent clinical trial consisting of 14 rectal cancer patients found they were in complete remission with zero side effects after taking Dostarlimab.In fact, these positive results all occurred without the use of chemotherapy. While the trial was done on rectal cancer patients, researchers believe it could be a potential treatment for many forms of cancer.‚ÄúWhen we give immunotherapy, it really just revs up the immune system so that it sees the cancer and gets rid of it, but what‚Äôs so remarkable here is that it completely eliminated the cancer,‚Äù explained Dr. Andrea Cercek, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ‚ÄúThe tumors just vanished in all 14 consecutive patients.

Despite this, Boudin blamed his loss on being outspent three-to-one.‚ÄúVoters were not asked to choose between criminal justice reform and something else,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúThey were given an opportunity to voice their frustration and their outrage, and they took that opportunity.‚ÄùBoudin is the first San Francisco district attorney to be recalled in the city‚Äôs history.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:45 AM PT ‚Äì Wednesday, June 8, 2022The House Rules Committee debated on two pieces of gun control laws. In a Tuesday hearing, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) presented the Protect Our Kids and the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Acts.The Protect Our Kids and the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act is an omnibus package which raises the purchasing age for semiautomatic rifles, prohibits the possession of high capacity magazines, establishes requirements regulating the storage of firearms in residences and creates a registry for bump stock owners. Additionally, this measure would allow a family member or law enforcement official to petition a federal court to prohibit an individual they believe to be a risk to themselves from purchasing a firearm or ammunition.‚ÄúThe measures before us offer sensible solutions that a clear, convincing, in fact overwhelming majority of voters agree with,‚Äù McGovern stated. ‚ÄúAs a country, our leaders, including all of us here in this room, are responsible for making choices. If we do nothing, we are making a choice. We are choosing to be powerless. We are choosing to do nothing to stop the next mass shooting from happening on our watch.‚ÄùMcGovern also claimed that a majority of gun owners supported these two bills in the aftermath of the mass shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde.‚ÄúMost gun owners, I think, favor the stuff that we‚Äôre talking about here today,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúBut the extremists in the gun lobby, you know what? They‚Äôll have the last word and more children will die. And I hope maybe this is the moment that there are enough people in a bipartisan way here that will come together and actually do something.‚ÄùIn response to his arguments, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) argued they violated the Second Amendment and Congress should be looking into approaching the issue of mass shootings from a public health perspective.‚ÄúOur nation is in the midst of a widespread mental health crisis,‚Äù Cole explained. ‚ÄúThe growing number and frequency of mass shootings are a reminder that our country must take a comprehensive public health approach to gun violence that addresses culture, mental illness, gun safety and regulations that also respect the Second Amendment. But unfortunately, the measures before us today do not meet that test.‚ÄùGun control laws only disarm law-abiding citizens because criminals don‚Äôt follow the law.‚Äî Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) June 8, 2022Meanwhile, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) pointed out a major flaw in the Democrats push to implement gun reform legislation.‚ÄúThe gun bills that are presented here today all suffer a common flaw that almost all gun control suffers from, and that is criminals don‚Äôt obey the law,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúGood guys obey the law. They‚Äôll disarm in a gun free zone and then that‚Äôs, those are the types of places that the criminals seek out. The chairman said that these bills are not an attempt to take away people‚Äôs guns, but in reality these bills will take all guns from some people and some guns from all people. And predominantly it will limit law abiding citizens access to guns.‚ÄùIn the meantime, both bills are expected to hit the House floor this week.","House Rules Committee Ranking Member Tom Cole, R-Okla., left, and Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., confer as the panel prepares to advance a Democratic gun control bill to the floor, the Protecting Our Kids Act, in response to the recent mass shootings in Texas and New York, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.

However, some are still criticizing him for past grievances. This comes as both sides of the aisle are in agreement when it comes to helping veterans.Biden signed the legislation into law Tuesday to honor and improve care for veterans. some of the bills seek to provide better access to mammograms for veterans exposed to burn pits, improve breast imaging services. . and to compensate veterans who have developed cancer or medical conditions from World War II-era nuclear programs. Additionally, the President said they are focused on veterans future.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to strengthen the oversight of the VA‚Äôs activities so veterans get the care they deserve,‚Äù Biden stated. ‚ÄúAnd restoring educational systems benefits so veterans displaced by COVID-19 can continue to gain new skills to meet the demands and change in the workforce.‚ÄùHowever, Army combat veteran and Florida congressional candidate Cory Mills slammed the administration on Tuesday for failing to show respect for veterans in the past.‚ÄúThis is the same guy who wouldn‚Äôt even recognize the 13 fallen who died in Afghanistan and perished during his State of the Union address,‚Äù said Mills. ‚ÄúHe has missed multiple engagements to actually try and show sympathy or show honor, show respect for our fallen heroes and he‚Äôs failed to do so.‚ÄùBiden was also criticized for acknowledging D-Day late.‚ÄúWe had 150,000 brave Americans who actually landed on the shores to try and take back and fight against the axis of evil,‚Äù said Mills. ‚ÄúThat 150,000 was considered to be an invasion? We have just in the last couple of months, over 150,000 who have crossed our borders, but the Biden administration still refuses to call that an invasion. The Biden administration is failing us in every single way and what a gaffe to not actually recognize the greatest generation of our lifetimes.‚Äù78 years ago we sent 150,000 of our bravest on D-Day for the launch of the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù to defeat evil. Today the Dems do not think the 2,000,000 that has crossed this year, the 150,000 in coming months, and the 11.3M already residing inside the US illegally is an invasion.‚Äî Cory Mills üçä (@CoryMillsFL) June 6, 2022","President Joe Biden arrives to speak and sign into law nine bipartisan bills that will honor and improve care for America‚Äôs veterans during an event in the State Dining room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.
