1:50 PM PT",Lake: Fentanyl ‘Poisoning’ American Young Adults,"As authorities across the country warn of the spread of “brightly colored fentanyl and fentanyl pills,” Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake said fentanyl needs to be at the top of all Americans’ minds moving forward.“I call it poisoning,” Lake explained.The Drug Enforcement Administration released a warning regarding this “rainbow fentanyl” seized in 18 states. The DEA says it could be a new strategy used by the cartels to make it look like candy to children and younger people.“By allowing the cartels to have control of our border Joe Biden’s policy, we are allowing the cartels with the help of a CCP in China to kill more than a hundred thousand of our citizens,” Lake said. “And I think the numbers are going to go up.”The National Institute on Drug Abuse explains fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Lake says she feels a motherly urge to protect the state’s children. “I found out that last year in Arizona, thirty-three children died from fentanyl poisoning,” said Lake. “Seven of them were under the age of one. I’m a mother and I can’t live with that. I just can’t allow that to happen in our state anymore.” Lake called fentanyl “a weapon of mass destruction.”“We need to treat the cartels as terrorists,” said Lake. “That’s what they are. And we need to treat this fentanyl crisis for what it is: a national security crisis and a national health crisis.”",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png," Legal Nonprofit: Michigan Unwilling To Purge ‘25,000’ Dead People On Voter RollsTOPICS:Arizonakari lakenewsOANOANNpolitics TWEETPIN",https://www.oann.com/lake-fentanyl-poisoning-american-young-adults/

McCabe — OAN National Political CorrespondentUPDATED 12:02 PM PT – Friday, September 9, 2022(Tallahassee, Fla.) Florida Republican Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis got a huge validation for his schools agenda with Friday’s release of the Heritage Foundation’s inaugural 2022 Education Freedom Report Card.The Washington-based Heritage Foundation rated Sunshine State schools No. 1 in the country, and it was the only state to rank in the top 10 in all four categories.Florida was ranked first in transparency, second in regulatory freedom, third in school choice, and seventh in return on spending.Heritage ranked Arizona second and Idaho third.DeSantis has committed to reforming Florida schools, both administratively and politically. The governor barnstormed the state in support of conservative school board candidates, and with the help of the 1776 Project PAC and Moms for Liberty flipped five county school boards from leftist control.Speaking at a rally for his endorsed candidates in Jacksonville, the governor said he was pushing leftwing political education out of the schools, in favor of education-education.“I don’t remember ideology being injected into my school. I just learned basic subjects. But now you have a situation in which so many people, they want to use our school system not to educate kids, they want to indoctrinate kids,” he said.“Two plus two equals four. It’s not two plus two, and how does that make you feel? Or is that an injustice?” he said.“You saw us do that by passing a curriculum transparency legislation that I signed, I guess it was probably about four or five months ago at this point, guaranteeing the right of every parent in Florida to know what’s being taught to their kids in school, to know what textbooks are being used,” the governor said. “You’d think that would be a no-brainer.”Heritage ranked District of Columbia schools 51st in the nation, chased by New York, 50th and New Jersey 49th.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png," DeSantis Debrief: Fla.

She added the difference between American citizens and immigrants is “artificial obstruction.”“Right now, you don’t have the choice because in Georgia if you are undocumented, you are denied full access. That does not make sense. We are growing the next generation of leaders and I believe we should be investing,” Abrams said. “It doesn’t take away from anyone for immigrant students to be able to attend our schools.”Meanwhile, even Democrats are worried about Abrams’s current standing in Georgia’s gubernatorial race.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:02 PM PT – Saturday, September 10, 2022The Biden administration has vowed to continue selling arms to the Ukraine despite claims saying the US is trying to prolong the crisis in the country. The military industrial complex confirmed it will continue sending weapons to Ukraine for “as long as it takes” amid its war with Russia.While speaking in the Czech Republic on Friday, Defense Department Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Biden administration’s military aid packages to Ukraine have worked to stop Russia from swiftly taking over the west-aligned country.A day well spent with Czech leaders; Defense Minister @jana_cernochova, Prime Minister @P_Fiala, and President @HradOfficialENG in Prague to affirm our strong defense ties and commitment to @NATO’s deterrence and defense in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/IfKR4TjPPM— Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III (@SecDef) September 9, 2022Secretary Austin also touted that the Pentagon is sending over a slew of weapon systems in order to give troops on the ground the option to mix and match them in their offensives against Russian soldiers.“So, we see success in Kherson now,” Austin said. “We see some success in in Kharkiv. And so that’s very, very encouraging. But it’s not just about one particular weapon or weapon system. That is about how you integrate these systems and how you integrate the efforts of various elements in the inventory to create effects that provide advantage to the Ukrainians. We’re beginning to see that. And so, I think, I think they have they have great capability. They’re using it the right way. We’ll stay engaged and make sure that we’re giving them what they what they need to be successful. Thanks.”Meanwhile at the United Nations, America’s Deputy Ambassador to the International Organization Richard Mills, defended the billions-of-dollars in military aid sent to Ukraine. He fired back against Russia’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, who claimed that America and its western allies are trying to perpetuate the conflict. Nebenzya also claimed that the United States is trying to achieve their longstanding goal to rid the world of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Mills and the UK’s UN Ambassador went on to decry Russia’s military operation as a violation of the charter. They also announced that they are not going to hide their support for the weaker Ukraine. However, Russia’s Ambassador warned that western weapons going to other countries always ends in unnecessary bloodshed.“A significant proportion of these weapons finds itself in the hands of smugglers right from the warehouses,” Nebenzya said. In the darknet you can find all kinds of offers to buy this weapon. We’ve already seen similar situations in the Balkans and the Middle East where Western military arsenals were then re-exported to Europe and then used by criminal groups on European territory or found their way into the hands of terrorists.”In the meantime, it doesn’t appear that the Biden administration is slowing down their arms sales to Ukraine. Biden recently approved a DOD request to supply $675 million worth of weapons to the country. Bill LaPlante, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment added that the administration is looking to continue filling billions-of-dollars’ worth of orders in the months to come.“To date, approximately 1.2 billion is already on contract,” LaPlante announced. “Of the 4.8 billion committed through USAI and then for replenishment, an additional 1.2 billion is on contract of the over 7 billion that is notified to Congress excuse me, throughout the remainder of the month, we expect to announce several additional awards. We remain committed to getting things on contract as quickly as possible. Ultimately, to send a clear and persistent demand signal to our partners in industry.”Meanwhile, foreign policy experts, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, warned that Ukraine’s demands for peace are unreasonable and that America’s encouragement of their operations could lead to a prolonged time of suffering for both sides of the conflict. Kissinger also warned that America’s foreign policy now looks like it’s made without reason or strategy. He added that continuing on this path could lead to major conflicts with superpowers such as Russia and China.","President Joe Biden speaks at a Democratic National Committee event at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, Thursday, Sept. 8, 2022, in Oxon Hill, Md.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:22 PM PT – Friday, September 9, 2022Once again, the Biden administration is trying to gaslight the American people into thinking their policies have improved America’s economy. The administration is touting their so-called Economic Blueprint. There, they claimed that the first two years of Biden’s term were two of the most productive in history.The White House released a 58-page document on Friday. The document boasted both job and wage gains. It also mentioned the ‘bold and decisive action’ from the administration that comes as the country continues to recover from losses caused by lockdowns. Biden also claimed on Twitter that his first two years in office have ‘spurred the strongest economic recovery in recent history’.My first two years in office spurred the strongest economic recovery in recent history. Today, I'm releasing my Economic Blueprint, a look at how our wins are rebuilding an economy that works for working families.https://t.co/eSlr3ymdo8It's long. So here are the big things:— President Biden (@POTUS) September 9, 2022The documents release comes after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke in Michigan on the current administration’s economic plan.“Our plan, powered by the Inflation Reduction Act, represents the largest investment in fighting climate change in our country’s history, and it will put us well on our way toward a future where we depend on the wind, the sun and other clean sources of energy,” Yellen said. “We will reduce ourselves from our current dependence on fossil fuels and the whims of autocrats like Putin.”Despite these claims, Americans continue to feel the effects of historic inflation. However, the Biden administration said it has accomplished the greatest economic achievements in decades.“The recent trifecta of legislation our administration has signed into law will strengthen the foundations of long-term growth at the core of our post-pandemic economy,” Yellen stated. “Our economy, continues to expand and is upgrading above levels that would have been predicted pre-pandemic. It’s fair to say by any traditional metric, we have experienced one of the quickest recoveries in our modern history.”The administration says their blueprint is built on five ideas they claim will help American workers.The first idea is to empower workers by expanding jobs and wages. The idea also plans on giving people the power to unionize. The second idea is to make and build in America by investing in infrastructure and innovation in so-called clean energy and buying in America. The third idea is to give families what they call breathing room by lowering costs and allowing greater access to prescription drugs as well as by creating more affordable healthcare and childcare. The next idea is increasing competitiveness in the American industry by opening up corporation control and raising up small businesses. The last idea is by rewarding working class Americans by reforming taxes to ensure that household tax on those making less than $400,000 a year are never raised.The document was released as Biden was headed to Ohio. He visited the Buckeye State to oversee the ground breaking of a new manufacturing facility for intel, something the administration attributes to the passage of the CHIPS Act earlier this year.In my State of the Union Address, I shared a story of a field of dreams in Ohio where our future will be built. Then I signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law.And now, I'm in Ohio breaking ground on a microchip factory.All in nine months.

ESG stands for Environmental Social Corporate Governance and is spearheaded by powerful investment firms like BlackRock. ESG seeks to foist climate and social causes upon corporations – and punish them by giving them low “scores” for such measurements and fossil fuel usage or support for Black Lives Matter and corporate stances on abortion. The rise of ESG by powerful money actors has been slammed by critics as the hijacking of the private sector for political purposes. ESG is an illegal leftist scheme for circumventing democratic processes to impose arbitrarily-determined standards on companies in order to hijack the free enterprise system for political purposes.@BlackRock is a leader in ESG illegality.https://t.co/RDZzw3Y6lD— Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) September 8, 2022The result of this activist metric on Wall Street has sparked one of the most consequential ideological wars of our time. Spearheading that war in the resistance as west Virginia’s Attorney General, Patrick Morrisey, who penned a letter last month along with 19 other States Attorneys General. The letter sought from BlackRock more transparency in how it is implementing ESG in their respective states.Morrisey tells OAN, West Virginia has blacklisted firms like Blackrock and JP Morgan and others until these firms can better assure the state they will not punish companies for their fossil fuel use.“They’re trying to move to a radical green new deal perspective, where you start to get rid of all of the fossil fuels.” Morrisey says his state has pushed back – and won – in the courts but as a result, woke capitalism has found a backdoor towards pushing their climate and social agenda.“What they couldn’t get through the government they’re trying to get and to push through this ESG idea” says Morrisey, “to try to transform these companies to not only being profit making enterprises, but to advance their political goals as well.”Nearly one month after Morrisey’s letter to Blackrock – the firm this week responded. Denying that ESG was a means to push a political agenda and that Blackrock favors companies that support “transitioning away from fossil fuels.” That this push was driven not by political agenda but because transitioned companies are “better long term investments.”Morrisey responded to this letter in an OAN exclusive: “I don’t think it’s a credible response for a couple reasons. Their CEO has been very clear that his view of the role of capitalism is to have transformative social economic change.”“They’ve been going after this issue for many years, and they know that the broader efforts have failed on the regulatory front. So now they’re trying to influence the securities exchange commission. They’re trying to influence a lot of the state pension boards in order to adopt their view of the universe with respect to ESG. And that doesn’t work for most of America and especially West Virginia.”Morrisey says Blackrock is being disingenuous in their response and that his office has seen evidence contradicting their defensive claims this week. ",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Biden’s Mixed Messaging Attacking Trump Republicans — Tiny RalliesTOPICS:BlackrockESGmorriseynewsOANOANNpoliticsWall Street TWEETPIN,https://www.oann.com/blackrock-defends-woke-esg-capitalism-wv-ag-morrisey-hits-back/

The DOJ claimed that allowing a special master to take the time to review the documents could irreparably cause harm to the investigation.Following the DOJ’s announcement, Trump said that the department was wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on the appeal. Trump also claimed the agency is asking for his trust despite spying on his campaign and lying to federal courts in order to obtain FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) warrants. He argued that the search warrant itself was over-broad and that the judge ruled that he could be harmed by improper disclosure of sensitive information seized. Trump said the judge who signed the order was very brave and that the judge’s wise words have rang throughout the nation.The 45th President finished out his thoughts by saying the DOJ would rather waste money on this than use it to fight back against actual corruption in the government.","Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022.

(AP Photo/Paul Vernon)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:09 PM PT – Friday, September 9, 2022Joe Biden continues to try and sway voters ahead of the midterm elections. While speaking at a DNC rally in Maryland on Thursday, Biden lambasted the MAGA movement. He described the members of the movement to be full of hated and division.Joe Biden on MAGA Republicans: ""They threaten our very democracy."" pic.twitter.com/euAZQN36me— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 9, 2022This comes in spite of his own party advocating for political violence.  Their rhetoric on police led to the Black Lives Matter riots in 2020. Vice President Kamala Harris encouraged the so-called fiery but mostly peaceful protests.“But the extreme set of MAGA Republicans has chosen to go backwards,” Biden claimed. “Full of anger, violence, hate and division. And that’s what their game is. And together, Democrats, Independents and mainstream Republicans can choose a different path forward to a future of unity and hope and some optimism and choose. We choose the Democrats to build a better America, and we have such an opportunity to do it.”The self-proclaimed “great uniter” then went on to claim that America First Republicans will attempt to pass a national ban on abortion if they regain control despite the overturn of Roe v. Wade putting the decision in the hands of the States. However, Biden failed to mention that his administration was already exploring options to circumvent the Supreme Court’s decision such as suing states like Idaho for banning the procedure.“If they win control of the House and Senate, they made it clear they’re going to try to pass a national ban. But as long as I’m president, they’re going to get it done because I’ll veto it,” the Democrat said. “Look. If they had their way, it won’t matter where you live. In America, women won’t have a right to choose anywhere, anywhere. I’m not going to let that happen. I really mean that. If they had their way, they’d come after the contraception and marriage equality, the whole right to privacy. They were very straightforward when this passed.”Biden also reiterated his disdain for the Second Amendment by invoking the locations of several mass shootings. The Democrat said he is determined to ban so-called assault weapons, saying he will do it for children whose deaths remain unreported due to mass shootings.Joe Biden: ""I'm determined to ban assault weapons."" pic.twitter.com/LXMFfxUuRa— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 8, 2022This remark comes as a majority of these deaths relating to guns are being reported in mostly Democrat run cities such as Chicago and New York. These cities have very stringent gun control laws in place.“I’m determined to ban assault weapons,” Biden announced. “I did it once before. And we’re going to do it again. We’re going to do it for those families in Buffalo and Nevada, Newtown, El Paso, Parkland, Charleston, Las Vegas, Orlando. I met with those families. Virtually every one of them over these years. It’s devastating what happened to them. Ladies and gentlemen, we’re going to do it all for those kids. We got gunned down on the streets every single day and never get recorded.” Biden’s rhetoric has become increasingly more partisan in the lead up to November’s midterms in which multiple MAGA Republicans are vying for seats in Congress.","President Joe Biden speaks during the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility in New Albany, Ohio, Friday, Sept. 9, 2022.
