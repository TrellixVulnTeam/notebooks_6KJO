(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:26 PM PT ‚Äì Wednesday, July 13, 2022The data is in and it‚Äôs now confirmed that US inflation has reached a new 40-year record high. On Wednesday, the Labor Department released the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for June, showing it increased 9.1 percent from a year ago. The CPI measures a range of prices from gas, groceries, cars and furniture to name a few.This number is above economists estimates of 8.8 percent. The report shows the largest contributors to inflation were shelter, gas, used vehicles and new cars. The Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates to combat inflation, but the latest inflation data is continuing to fuel concerns of a recession.Joe Biden‚Äôs failed economic agenda continues to punish Americans with 40-year high inflation, declining real wages, and a higher cost of living.‚Äî GOP (@GOP) July 10, 2022Just days ago, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House expects an ‚Äúelevated‚Äù inflation report for June, but claimed the numbers would be ‚Äúout of date.‚Äù This comes as some Republican lawmakers have accused Biden administration officials of misleading the American people about inflation.For instance, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu recently slammed US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for doing just that. Sununu said low-income families and others on fixed incomes are going to suffer this coming winter with home heating costs expected to soar past record rates.In December, Biden claimed we were at ‚Äúthe peak‚Äù of inflation when prices spiked 7%. Now they are up 9.1% ‚Äì a new 40-year high.‚Äî Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) July 13, 2022Meanwhile, Yellen previously shifted the responsibility of dealing with inflation away from the White House by claiming the Federal Reserve is responsible for dealing with the American economy. Prior to this, Yellen had suggested the Biden administration was running out of options to address its mishandling of the economy.Used cars for sale are parked roadside at an auto lot in Philadelphia, Tuesday, July 12, 2022.

In a statement Wednesday, Biden called the new inflation numbers ‚Äúout of date.‚Äù He added the notion that energy alone comprised nearly half of the monthly increase in inflation.Biden then claimed the data does not reflect the full impact of nearly 30 days of decreases in gas prices that have reduced the price at the pump by about 40 cents since mid-June. He also pointed out inflation is also high in Europe and other countries while suggesting many countries are battling COVID related challenges. Nonetheless, the Democrat insisted combating inflation is still his top priority.Meanwhile, Biden‚Äôs predecessor said 40-year high inflation is ‚Äúterrible for our country.‚Äù In a post on Truth Social Wednesday, Trump pointed out that fuel prices are up 60 percent, airfare is up 34 percent and eggs rose 33 percent. He then questioned how residents and businesses can survive amid the high prices.(Trump Statement)Trump asserted Democrats don‚Äôt know what they are doing and all they want to do is ‚Äúget trump.‚Äù He suggested those on the left are ‚Äúwilling to destroy the nation to do it.

While speaking to the press Tuesday, GOP leadership addressed the matter while asserting their colleagues on the left are attempting to solve the economic crisis by spending more money.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got rampant, runaway inflation,‚Äù stated Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). ‚ÄúThe American people are paying the price and what is the Democrat prescription? To double down, to spend more and to tax more.‚ÄùThe alleged new spending package could supposedly cut the initial cost by $1 trillion and aims to focus on health care costs and energy. However, this would require raising taxes, which would primarily hit business owners and corporations.‚ÄúNow they want to pour fuel on the flames by making it more likely that we go into a recession by raising taxes on all of these businesses,‚Äù explained Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). ‚ÄúThe vast majority of businesses in America, which will only cause them to reduce the number of employees.‚ÄùSen.

Thune said Democrats real ‚Äúprescription‚Äù won‚Äôt benefit the American people.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about higher taxes on the American people, higher taxes on businesses, higher prices and lower wages,‚Äù stressed the South Dakota Republican. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Democrat prescription.‚ÄùAccording to reports, Democrats hope to pass the revised bill before September by using the budget reconciliation process. However, Republicans are worried there could be long lasting effects if a spending package like this is passed.‚ÄúThe American people have had enough,‚Äù Thune stated. ‚ÄúAnd I hope there are a couple of wise Democrats who will sink this really bad idea and make sure that we don‚Äôt go down a path that leads to even more economic tumult the American people are already feeling.‚ÄùLIVE: The Senate Republican leadership team speaks to the press.

On Tuesday, both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed the Mexican leader to the White House.

This comes as the Biden administration has begged authoritarian governments in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for oil instead of America‚Äôs allies. Meanwhile, Lopez Obrador stressed he‚Äôs saving Americans in border towns some money by letting them cross the border to buy cheaper gas.‚ÄúWhile prices of gasoline goes down in the United States, I hope that Congress approves your proposal of (lowering gas prices),‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, while we‚Äôre waiting for gasoline prices to go down, we are allowing Americans who live near our border to fill up their vehicles (with gasoline) on the Mexican side at lower prices.‚ÄùAdditionally, the Mexican president slammed the state of the US-Mexico border. He said the Biden administration needs to take steps to transform the border and move away from the status quo. Lopez Obrador proposed the Biden administration to create new pathways for Mexican and Central American nationals to gain legal entry into the US. He explained that he hopes this will reduce ‚Äúirregular migration patterns while opening up new economic opportunities.‚ÄùLast week, there were over 13,000 illegal crossings in the Del Rio sector and 8,400 in the Rio Grande Valley.Our border is porous, and thousands are flooding across.

Lopez Obrador confirmed most of those migrants were Mexican nationals and stressed the need for better border security is urgent.‚ÄúRegularize now and give certainty to migrants who, since many years, work in an honest manner and contribute to the development of this great nation,‚Äù he stressed.The socialist president also praised Mexican citizens, touting their work in America bolsters the economies of both the US and Mexico.‚ÄúI just want to tell you that I love you very much, that love is repaid with love,‚Äù stated Lopez Obrador. ‚ÄúThat tomorrow at the White House we are going to talk about the rights of migrants and that we love you very much for all that you do, because you work here and you send money to your families.

We have to fight for every Senate seat in every state ‚Äì including here in Idaho ‚Äì to restore abortion rights. #idpol #CodifyRoe‚Äî David Roth ‚Äì Democratic Nominee to U.S. Senate (@rothforIdaho) July 13, 2022Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) described the high court‚Äôs ruling as ‚Äúbarbaric.‚Äù‚ÄúAbout one in 50 pregnancies in our country are ectopic,‚Äù Murray voiced. ‚ÄúThat means they‚Äôre not viable and without medical action they are deadly. In Republican‚Äôs post-Roe world, health care providers aren‚Äôt sure when or even if they will be able to treat ectopic patients without being sent to prison. Some have already been instructed to observe patients until they have unstable vital signs before acting. Basically, sit on your hands until women are at dire risk before you can do what is medically necessary. That is absolutely barbaric.‚ÄùSenate GOP just BLOCKED my bill w/ @SenCortezMasto to protect the right to travel‚Äîincluding to get abortion care. This move shows that they stand w/ extreme politicians trying to hold women captive in their own states rather than defending the right to travel within our country. pic.twitter.com/6ZxWlkbz27‚Äî Senator Patty Murray (@PattyMurray) July 14, 2022Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) pushed back against her statement. He accused Democrats of using scare tactics and lying to American citizens about state‚Äôs who have laws banning abortion.‚ÄúMyth three, overturning Roe means health care professionals in hospitals cannot treat women with miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies or when the mom‚Äôs life is endangered,‚Äù Marshall said. ‚ÄúThese are all scare tactics preying on the emotions of people. Listen, every state abortion law triggered by overturning Roe includes an exception to save the life of the mother. Treating miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are not the same as performing abortions. In fact, no abortion law in any state in America prevents treatment for women with ectopic pregnancies and or other life-threatening conditions.‚ÄùMeanwhile, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) played the middle man by saying Congress would have to look at the issue further down the line.‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve got to look at this again,‚Äù Murkowski stated. Again down the road. The balance of power in Congress moves back and forth. Without the filibuster do we really think, do we really believe that a different majority would not seek a nationwide ban on abortion and find a way to succeed in enacting it? The filibuster is really one of the few mechanisms that protects the rights of the minority. I raise this because I think we need to be looking long term at this.‚ÄùIn the meantime, states remain split on their reaction to Roe‚Äôs end while the White House is expressing interest in declaring a health emergency to protect access to the procedure.","From left, Illinois Lt.

On Wednesday, several Republican senators held a press conference to announce how they plan to end the crisis.Ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) introduced a new bill called the Solving Border Crisis Act. Risch said although it‚Äôs unlikely the current administration will change course, this bill could serve as a ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù for the next administration.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of implementing these solutions immediately to protect our sovereignty and national security,‚Äù stated the Idaho lawmaker. ‚ÄúWe will be pressing hard to move this legislation, but we are not na√Øve. We are here because the administration wants to have the situation the way it is because they could fix it and the could fix it easily. This isn‚Äôt going to change unless the administration reverses course and they probably won‚Äôt.‚ÄùThe Biden administration‚Äôs dismantling of the effective immigration system it inherited has created a full-blown disaster at the southern border.That's why @senrobportman & I have introduced the Solving the Border Crisis Act to prevent this disaster from getting any worse. pic.twitter.com/Hao8GVNykd‚Äî Jim Risch (@SenatorRisch) July 13, 2022He also noted that the current administration has dismantled the work of 45th President Donald Trump who worked hard to secure the US border. However, as Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) pointed out, this is not only a border crisis, but a drug smuggling crisis as well. He said it‚Äôs no longer just border states being affected while citing an increase in the number of deaths and overdoses from fentanyl all across the US.‚ÄúThe Democrats and Joe Biden have turned American into one big sanctuary city and have turned every state into a border state,‚Äù Barrasso stated. ‚ÄúIn my home state of Wyoming, we‚Äôve seen triple the number of deaths from fentanyl in the last two years.‚ÄùSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) even predicted South Texas will become red due to the Biden administration‚Äôs negligence to the southern border.‚ÄúI am predicting right now in November we will see South Texas, which has been electing Democrats for over 100 years, South Texas is going to elect at least two and maybe three new Republican members of Congress,‚Äù he asserted. ‚ÄúAll of whom are Hispanic woman, all of whom are are seeing the crime, disease and suffering and misery caused by Joe Biden‚Äôs open borders.‚ÄùThis comes as 2.6 million migrants have crossed the border illegally since Biden took office.
