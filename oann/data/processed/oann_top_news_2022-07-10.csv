3:28 PM PT",La. judge says she can’t extend restraining order on abortion ban,"Pro-life activists in Louisiana got a huge win in court. On Friday, a state judge said she cannot extend a restraining order on the state’s so-called “trigger law” imposed by a judge in New Orleans after Roe was overturned.The court has denied the request to extend the temporary restraining order in New Orleans. Abortion is again banned in Louisiana.— Emily Woodruff (@emily_woodruff_) July 8, 2022The decision came the same day President Joe Biden issued an executive order to protect access to abortion in states where it is still legal and mitigate the potential penalties women seeking the procedure may face after the high court’s ruling on June 24.Abortion rights advocates in numerous states have filed court challenges to laws restricting the procedure. In Mississippi, home of the case that led to the Supreme Court decision, attorneys for the state’s sole abortion clinic filed a petition on Thursday asking the state’s highest court to temporarily block a new law that bans most abortions. The attorneys made the request on the day the law took effect and two days after a Mississippi judge rejected the same request.Legal experts said this gives the state a green light to enforce its near-total abortion ban. However, Louisiana’s Attorney General Jeff Landry lamented that judges are punting the decision to other districts.“If they continue to operate, they do so under their own risk,” Landry said.Speaking after the court hearing today, @AGJeffLandry tells people who disagree with Louisiana’s abortion ban that they can move to another state pic.twitter.com/UFbdc3q3qG— Sam Karlin (@samkarlin) July 8, 2022Landry went on to vow that he will fight legal challenges to the state’s abortion ban in any court he’s sent to. He added that if residents don’t like that law they can urge their state representatives to change the law or move to another state.","Protesters wave signs and demonstrate in support of abortion access in front of a New Orleans courthouse Friday July 8, 2022.

Abbott authorized the state’s National Guard and Department of Public Safety to apprehend illegal migrants who cross the southern border.The executive order issued on Thursday also empowers the National Guard and DHS to return illegal aliens from across the US to the southern border. Abbot said Texas is taking “unprecedented action” because of Biden’s failing border policies, which has emboldened human smugglers and cartels. This comes after multiple counties in Texas declared the migrant crisis an invasion. They called on the Governor to take action.Abbott has taken significant action to secure the border in the wake of the federal government’s inaction. Some of those actions include securing $4 billion in funding for Texas border security efforts, launching Operation Lone Star and deploying thousands of National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, arresting and jailing illegal migrants trespassing or committing other state crimes in Texas and allocating resources that include acquiring 1,700 unused steel panels to build the border wall in Texas.“While the Biden Administration has abandoned border communities, the state of Texas will support them and help them respond to the disaster that President Biden has caused on the border,” said Abbott. “Operation Lone Star grant funding has played an integral role in our mission to keep Texans safe and support local communities. I encourage local governments to apply for these funds as we work together to prevent illegal immigration and the smuggling of people, illegal weapons and deadly drugs like fentanyl from Mexico into Texas.” I issued an Executive Order authorizing the Texas National Guard & Texas Dept. of Public Safety to return illegal immigrants to the border.Cartels have become emboldened by Biden's open border policies.Texas is taking unprecedented action to STOP this criminal enterprise. pic.twitter.com/ag08ACYP3Y— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) July 7, 2022In a separate announcement Abbott revealed Texas is allocating an additional $30 million to Operation Lone Star to help cities and counties boost border security.","FILE – In this March 16, 2020, file photo, Texas Gov.

Pierre said “it’s ok” for abortion rights protesters to accost Supreme Court justices.During a Friday press conference, she was asked by Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy if President Joe Biden found it appropriate for protesters to “intimidate Supreme Court justices when they’re out to eat.” Pierre asserted that the administration condemns the intimidation of judges and added that the administration had drawn the line as to which actions against judges would be permitted. She noted that protesters organizing outside of restaurants was well within the guidelines. Her response lead Doocy to push the issue further. He questioned if there was anywhere where she doesn’t think it’s appropriate to go.“We have been pretty clear on this,” Pierre stated. “The president has been very clear that we condemn any intimidation of judges in this specific question here. He has signed legislation making sure they have the protection that they need.”The secretary once again sidestepped the question and asserted that the administration condemned ”intimidation” but noted that demonstrators should be permitted to peacefully protest anywhere.“If protesters know a justice is out to eat at a restaurant then they can go and protest as long as they are what you consider peaceful?” Doocy questioned.“Well we have said that what we want to see is peaceful protest,” the secretary voiced. “That’s what we have said. We want to see protests that are peaceful but when it comes to intimidation that is something we have condemned.”The reporter went on to ask whether justices were afforded the same rights to privacy as anyone else. He questioned whether the protesters even had the right to be there.“People have the right, this is what a Democracy is,” she said. “Of course. People have a right to privacy, but they also have a right to be able to protest peacefully.”Karine Jean-Pierre on Brett Kavanaugh being forced out of a DC restaurant by protesters over his opinion:""This is what a democracy is."" pic.twitter.com/A8bsOXNXuc— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 8, 2022Doocy was unsatisfied with Pierre’s response and questioned whether allowing protesters to follow justices around could potentially create a dangerous situation for them.

We'll venmo you $50 for a confirmed sighting and $200 if they're still there 30 mins after your message. https://t.co/xXWZ5JZiE7— ShutDownDC (@ShutDown_DC) July 8, 2022Twitter has yet to remove the post despite it directly violating their policies which prohibits any user from encouraging others to harass an individual.“We prohibit behavior that encourages others to harass or target specific individuals or groups with abusive behavior,” the platform’s policy on abusive behavior states. “This includes, but is not limited to; calls to target people with abuse or harassment online and behavior that urges offline action such as physical harassment.”On Wednesday night, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was forced to sneak out of a Washington D.C. Morton’s Steakhouse when he was confronted by pro-choice protesters. The justice was forced to leave through the back door.“Honorable Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh and all of our other patrons at the restaurant were unduly harassed by unruly protestors while eating dinner at our Morton’s restaurant,” a Morton’s spokesperson told Politico in a statement. “Politics, regardless of your side or views, should not trample the freedom at play of the right to congregate and eat dinner. There is a time and place for everything. Disturbing the dinner of all of our customers was an act of selfishness and void of decency.”The six conservative justices targeted by ShutDownDC formed the majority that voted to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision in June.","Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh stands during a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, on April 23, 2021.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:15 PM PT – Friday, July 8, 2022An EF2 tornado slammed a rural area just outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. On Wednesday evening, the massive storm moved over Goshen and Fayetteville. The storm leveled buildings and left tens of thousands without power.The National Weather Service determined that the tornado touched down at 3:06 p.m. and remained on the ground until 3:14 p.m. The NWS also said the tornado’s maximum wind speed was 130 mph and its path length was 4.5 miles. As the tornado approached Goshen it strengthened rapidly and grew to about 750 yards in width.As of Friday, nearly 10,000 people in the region are still without power. Ohio Governor Mike Dewine surveyed the damage in Goshen and said the destruction showed how fragile life truly is.“It brings home to all of us how fragile life is and how in one minute the world can fundamentally change,” voiced Dewine. “That’s what’s happened to the people’s whose homes have been lost or homes have been destroyed.”Yesterday, I visited Goshen Township in Clermont County to survey tornado damage and talk with local residents and community leaders. Our @Ohio_EMA and @OSHP are on-site providing assistance, and we will continue to do all we can to help. pic.twitter.com/ffEetASy8O— Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) July 8, 2022According to Township Administrator Stephen Pegram, there is “extensive damage” to hundreds of homes. The majority of the damage is from trees falling on or going through homes and roofs. Part of the Goshen Fire Department building was damaged and will have to be destroyed and rebuilt.“The collapse of the exterior wall, interior ceilings have come down, damage to all the utilities,” said Pegram. “Gas, electric, phone, cable, internet. Everything has damage inside the building.”However, despite the extensive destruction no deaths have been reported as a result of the storm.","An American flag flies amidst debris of destroyed homes, in the aftermath of tornadoes that tore through the region, in Mayfield, Ky., Tuesday, Dec. 14, 2021.
