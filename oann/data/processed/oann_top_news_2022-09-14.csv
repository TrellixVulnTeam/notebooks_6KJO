2022-09-13,9:39 AM PT,Court Documents: Biden likely knew about FBI raid on Trump,"Latest court documents show President Joe Biden likely knew about the FBI’s Mar-a-Lago raid in advance. According to the Special Master Order by Judge Aileen Cannon, the FBI was granted access to Mar-a-Lago documents by the White House Counsel’s Office.The ruling also reveals the office acted in accordance with a request by “the incumbent president,” which is Joe Biden. The President has previously denied he had advance knowledge of the Mar-a-Lago raid. However, court documents show Biden may have lied about his role behind the ransack of Donald Trump’s estate and he could have potentially authorized the whole operation.According to Republicans, the raid on the 45th President of the United States could amount to abuse of authority by the Biden administration.","President Joe Biden speaks about student loan debt forgiveness in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022, in Washington.

The report added that these dead voters were sent mail-in ballots, after which their family members and ballot harvesters then cast a vote on their behalf, which is illegal.This information comes just days after Trump told his supporters in Pennsylvania that the 2020 election was stolen.“The 2020 election was rigged and stolen and now our country is being destroyed by people who got into office through cheating and through fraud,” Trump said.In a separate statement, the former President came to the defense of Politico publisher, Mathias Döpfner. Döpfner is under fire for saying he wished Trump would have won in 2020. Trump said that in fact –he won big.","US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One before departing Harlingen, Texas on January 12, 2021.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 5:40 PM PT – Monday, September 12, 2022A new poll has revealed the falling approval ratings of the federal judiciary system. According to the Axios-Ipsos poll on Monday, 35-percent of respondents agreed at some level that a president should be allowed to remove a federal judge if the judge makes a ruling that goes against national interests. However, the plurality of 43-percent said that the current separation of powers should remain in place.This poll comes amid outcry over the Dobbs Decision. The Dobbs Decision prompted the mainstream media and Democrat operatives to call for judicial reforms which critics say may undermine the Supreme Court. Kamala Harris claimed that the Dobbs decision led to ‘suffering.’“This Court took that constitutional right away,” Harris said. “And we are suffering as a nation because of it. That causes me great concern about the integrity of the Court overall.”In the meantime, other researchers are finding a huge gap in confidence in the US Judicial System, with Democrats echoing their leaders’ cries that the system is rigged against them. Federal agencies including the DHS are now warning that far left groups could use violence in response to court decisions they don’t agree with.","President Joe Biden listens as Ambassador Caroline Kennedy speaks before Biden about the cancer moonshot initiative at the John F.

In an interview on Sunday, Warner said that the US has defeated terrorism but it is now facing a threat from what he calls ‘domestic extremists.’This comes after the Biden DOJ and DHS came under fire by Republicans for allegedly targeting so-called right-wing extremists while ignoring threats posed by radical groups Antifa and BLM. Warner then went on to lash lump in those who questioned the 2020 elections with threats from Russia and China.“I think the threat of terror has diminished,” Warner said. “I think we still have new challenges in terms of nation-state challenges, Russia in longer-term, a technology competition with China. But I do worry about some of the activity in this country where the election deniers, the insurgency that took place on January 6th, that is something I hope we could see that same kind of unity of spirit.”Despite Warner’s claims of ‘defeating’ terror, the Islamic state recently attacked the Russian embassy in Kabul while Al-Qaeda is ramping up local efforts across Africa and Asia.","WASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 27: Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) smiles and raises his hands in response to shouted questions from reporters as he heads back to the Senate floor following a recess in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on January 27, 2020 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:41 PM PT – Monday, September 12, 2022Former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie (R-N.J.) thinks that the DOJ could have success in its appeal for the 45th President Donald J. Trump’s request for a special master.Christie was critical of the former President on Sunday’s show of ABC’s This Week. There, he said that the DOJ had asked Trump for the documents that were found in his Florida home for 16 months. He claimed that the department “had no choice” in taking the unprecedented action of raiding his Mar-a-Lago home. However, Trump has pushed back on these claims by saying he was cooperative when needed.Christie claimed that only the current executive can assert executive privilege, giving the DOJ a good case for an appeal.“There’s only one executive who can assert the privilege and that’s the one who is the current executive- Joe Biden,” Christie said. “A previous executive can’t exert executive privilege when they’re not the executive no longer. Biden will not exert executive privilege over these documents. I think the idea that some of these documents are somehow attorney client privilege is gonna be a bit of a reach and I think they’re gonna have to show, in some respect they have a good faith basis to make that claim. So, I think that the DOJ has a pretty good chance on appeal.”Trump argued that the search warrant itself was over-broad. The judge ruled that he could be harmed by improper disclosure of the sensitive information seized.","WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 04: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie speaks to members of the media in front of the U.S. Supreme Court December 4, 2017 in Washington, DC.

As the vote approaches, both the Democrat and Republican primaries for the State’s House seat have been cancelled due to only one candidate being put forth by each party.Democrat incumbent Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) was officially announced as the uncontested winner of her party’s primary once the deadline to file for a spot on the ballot passed on September 1. Rochester was first elected in 2016. During her time in office she has not been unseated. She continues to run following the larger Democrat party’s ideals.“These are things that are real and are affecting people every single day,” Rochester said. “And what we’re saying is we are not going to sit back and wait for something to miraculously happen to solve our issues.”The Inflation Reduction Act invests in our future by addressing some of the most pressing concerns of Delawareans – like lowering health care & energy costs. 📹: @47abc pic.twitter.com/npDxFpSKOW— Rep.

His platform and message have stayed largely the same since then.“The radical left has weaponized crisis after crisis,” Lee said. “They’re trying to shut down our economy. They’re trying to take away our rights. They’re trying to divide us, but let me tell you one thing, they are going to fail.”This will be the second time that Rochester and Murphy will face off in an election. Both of them ran for the seat last cycle. In the meantime, the State’s ballots are filled with State and local primaries.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:05 PM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022While speaking at Boston’s JFK Library on Monday, Biden gave an update on his administration’s campaign promise to find a cure for cancer. He announced that his goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50 percent within the next 25 years.I believe we can end cancer as we know it and even cure cancers once and for all.— President Biden (@POTUS) September 12, 2022During his speech, Biden attempted to rally Americans behind this battle by comparing it to President John F. Kennedy’s race to beat communists to the moon. For Biden, this vow is a personal one after he lost his son Beau Biden to brain cancer in 2015.“In February, I laid out our plan that is bold, ambitious, and, I might add, completely doable,” Biden said. “The goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50%, at least 50% in the next 25 years. To turn more cancers from death sentences into chronic diseases people can live with, to create more supportive experience for patients and families, and update, update our fight against the cancer.”Part of Biden’s plan is to assign biologist and former government scientist Doctor Renee Wegrzyn to be the Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health or ARPA-H. The ARPA-H was established earlier this year in March and is being tasked with studying potential treatments or cures for cancer..@POTUS announces his intent to nominate Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). pic.twitter.com/PtuqX6ILRU— CSPAN (@cspan) September 12, 2022The Democrat also announced a new scholars program to provide resources to early career scientists studying the disease.“ARPA-H will have the singular purpose to drive breakthroughs to prevent, detect and treat diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes and other diseases and enable us to live healthier lives,” Biden said.Additionally, Biden announced the signing of a new executive order directing the federal government to ensure the technology needed for such studies is built here in the United States. However, the Democrat did not elaborate on how he would uphold this order.“But it’s not enough to invent technologies to save lives. We need to manufacture advanced biotechnologies here in the United States,” Biden stated. “That’s why today I signed an executive order that directs the federal government to ensure biotechnology is invented in the United States of America, are made in the United States of America.”Despite this, what could’ve been considered a speech which delivered on his promise to be a ‘great unifier,’ quickly turned into political theater. Biden reverted to Democrat talking points about so-called inequities in the country’s healthcare system which supposedly bars non-white, the disabled and LGBTQ individuals from affording medical treatment.“It’s a disease we often diagnose too late and have too few ways to prevent it in the first place, where there are stark inequities based on race, disability, zip code, sexual orientation, gender identity and other factors,” Biden said.In the meantime, over 250 cancer research programs have been established since 2017.","President Joe Biden arrives with Vice President Kamala Harris and Lovette Jacobs, a fifth year IBEW Local 103 electrical apprentice in Boston, for a ceremony where Biden will sign H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 3:33 PM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022The White House’s second in command has a very different vision for America than its founders. Vice President Kamala Harris said that the southern border is secure but has claimed that the Supreme Court is a threat to the United States.Harris made these statements while on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd over the weekend. There, Todd pressed the border czar on the nearly two million known border crossings during her tenure. The Vice President asserted that the nation’s boundaries are stable. She blamed the Trump administration for the influx of illegal immigrants.“We have a secure border and that is a priority for any nation including ours in our administration,” Harris said. “But there are still a lot of problems that we are trying to fix given the deterioration that has happened over the last four years. We also have to put in place a law and a plan for a pathway for citizenship.”Harris also blamed Republican governors for playing politics with people’s lives. The Democrat asserted that Americans should be more concerned than they are with the recent rulings from the Supreme Court. She called the judicial body an activist court and then lambasted them for returning the abortion policy back to the states. The Californian claimed such a decision to be a threat to the American system. Harris said Democrats must eliminate the filibuster to protect democracy by ramming their agenda through both houses with a slim majority.“The President has been clear on this issue and on a very important issue in addition to that important issue which is voting rights,” The Vice President said. “And the President has been very clear, he will sign into law and not let the filibuster get in the way, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Acts and the Freedom to Vote Act.” Harris also warned that election deniers pose a threat to the country. This comes as she and the Democrats gear up to increase their majorities in the House and Senate. However, when Todd asked Harris why Democrats elevated Republican opponents who question the 2020 election, the Vice President dodged the question and touted her own campaign record.""You’re not worried that this reflects poorly on the Democrats?""

10:27 AM PT",Cringe Optics: Biden Takes Victory Lap During Economic Nosedive,"Cringe Optics: Biden Takes Victory Lap During Economic NosediveChanel Rion — OAN Chief White House CorrespondentUPDATED 10:27 AM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022An optically difficult day for the White House – as the economy tanks at news of roaring inflation and a higher than expected CPI rate, Biden staffers assembled the President for a photo op taking the bow for his inflation reduction efforts.The White House found itself stuck in a corner Tuesday. Having slated the day for “thousands of supporters” to stand in “celebration” of Biden’s efforts to fight inflation, the Consumer Price Index delivered a shocking blow.August inflation rates surged against expectations bringing the average inflation rate – excluding food and energy – to 8.3%. This is double the core CPI forecast. But in spite of the evidence, the White House plowed forward, taking a victory lap:With the Inflation Reduction Act, the American people won and the special interests lost.Today, we celebrate its passage at the White House. pic.twitter.com/FQDRLkKK1m— President Biden (@POTUS) September 13, 2022Many economists – and in turn the White House – expected the August CPI numbers to actually go down due to the decline in oil and gas prices from the previous month. Gas is down nearly 10%. But Tuesday’s numbers proved not only was this drop in gas prices not enough to stave off economic woes – but the economy is deteriorating at a much faster rate than expected. The average American can’t keep up.The typical American household now pays $460 MORE per month on the same goods and services they were paying for last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. That’s over $5500 more per year per household.President Biden, ahead of his Inflation Reduction Act signing event at the White House, was forced to release a statement insisting his policies are taking America in the right direction despite the evidence:Today’s data show more progress in bringing global inflation down in the US economy.  Overall, prices have been essentially flat in our country these last two months: that is welcome news for American families, with more work still to do.  Gas prices are down an average of $1.30 a gallon since the beginning of the summer.Undergirding Biden’s insistence of “progress” in the US economy are three big narratives;  real wages are up, gas is down, and inflation was not cause by Biden’s $1.9 Trillion spending bill.But wages are not up: Average hourly pay, adjusted for inflation are down -2.8%.A closer look at individual necessities only make the picture worse; Eggs are up nearly 40% since last year, food and basic costs are gobbling up any small gains being made in US salaries. The US economy has now suffered 17 consecutive months under Biden spending policies where inflation outpaced wage growth.That basic costs for virtually everything are spiking significantly cancels out any good news on the gas front. While gas prices have gone down 10% in the last month, compared to this time last year, gas prices are still up a whopping 25% year over year. Utilities are up 33% since last year.Even the head of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors confronted the bad news bluntly: “CPI report not pretty.”CPI report not pretty. Headline fine (0.1% CPI for Aug or a 1.4% annual rate in that month, with prices up 8.3% over the last year).Problem is excluding volatile food and energy and was ugly (0.6% for Aug or a 7.0% annual rate).Broad-based relief not coming. pic.twitter.com/WVODxYmrYm— Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) September 13, 2022And since the passage of Biden’s $1.9 Trillion spending bill, inflation has only been aggravated month after month contradicting the Biden position insisting inflation would only be temporary:Happy 1 year anniversary of Biden lying about inflation only being ""temporary."" pic.twitter.com/p4KZO9eDSx— Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) July 19, 2022Just last month, Biden was mocked for claiming there was zero inflation – touting a slight decrease in inflation that has since been cancelled out.Tuesday, Biden took to social media to encourage Americans to join him in celebrating his Inflation Reduction Act.Exactly four weeks ago, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law.So today, we're celebrating.Tune in at 3 PM ET as I deliver remarks and welcome the leaders and advocates who made it happen to the People's House.— President Biden (@POTUS) September 13, 2022At the time of Biden’s tweet, the Nasdaq plunged by over 840 points into the red.

However, Republican Governor Chris Sununu endorsed State Senate President Chuck Morse. Sununu believes that he has the best chance at defeating the incumbent Maggie Hassan. In the State’s 1st Congressional District, the Republican party is split between two young former Trump employees. Matt Mowers and Karoline Leavitt are duking it out to see who can carry on the mantle of Trump.In Rhode Island, Republicans are hoping to flip a key Democrat-held house seat. Several candidates are in the running to replace Rhode Island’s outgoing Democrat representative Jim Langevin. A Republican contender for Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District is the former Mayor of Cranston, Allan Fung. He has the potential to turn this district red for the first time in 30-years. Fung says he’s focused on fixing the ripple effects of the Biden administration’s rampant energy and inflation crisis.“Right now, I’m focused on the people’s priorities and that’s how to get by in this crippling economy that’s been put forward by the policies from President Biden and his administration, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the members of Congress spending’s have been out of control leading to this rapid inflation,” Fung said. “We gotta drive those costs down. Energy prices are out of control, oil and gas, it’s containable. We’re talking about these prices bumping up over $5 a gallon… this is crazy. I want to run to fix a lot of these problems and make us energy independent again.” The 2nd District has been in Democrat hands since 1990. Despite this, history shows that it has the potential to turn red as it has made a gradual shift to the right in recent years.Meanwhile, Langevin has endorsed Rhode Island Democrat and General Treasurer Seth Magaziner to replace him. This comes after Magaziner abandoned his race for Governor to run in the 2nd District primary.“I say that we need to hold this seat in Democratic hands and we need a candidate on the Democratic ticket who has run in the district, won in the district, represented the district for the last seven years as I have as State Treasurer,” Magaziner said. “We need to maximize our chances of winning the seat.” Polls currently show Magaziner losing to Fung by six points. Fung also has statewide recognition due to his two runs for governor against Gina Raimondo in 2014 and in 2018.","People vote at the Greenspring Retirement center during the mid-term election day in Fairfax, Virginia on November 6, 2018.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:06 AM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022The Consumer Price Index report for August is out, showing inflation is up 8.3 percent from a year ago. Economists were expecting 8.1 percent year-over-year. The Labor Department released the report Tuesday, indicating inflation is slightly up by 0.1 percent from July.The CPI measures a range of prices for a typical basket of goods while core inflation does not include food and energy. The report shows inflation still remains near its highest levels in more than 40-years. The Federal Reserve has taken an aggressive approach to raise interest rates to combat inflation and will likely continue to raise rates following the latest report.President Joe Biden has continued to boast revving up America’s economy, despite data showing he’s only ramping up inflation. As long as Biden says the economy is booming, it has to be true right?On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave Democrats in the upper chamber a reality check when he detailed how Biden’s economic policies are actually affecting Americans.“And poll after poll has shown they’re overwhelmingly dissatisfied with what President Biden and his party have done since then,” he stated. “One survey found five consecutive times that more than 70 percent of Americans say our country is headed in the wrong direction, but that hasn’t stopped Washington Democrats from following the same disastrous play over and over and over again.”McConnell went on to squawk at Democrats for constantly proposing and passing bloated spending bills through Congress, stressing overspending by the federal government is causing of inflation. He pointed out after GOP warnings of skyrocketing inflation from the American Rescue Plan and Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, Democrats last month rolled out yet another bloated bill with the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.The Kentucky Republican claims that legislation only continues Biden’s war on American energy, weaponizes the IRS against average Americans and prioritizes the Biden climate agenda over the American public.“But the American people don’t want tens-of billions of dollars in wish fulfillment for climate activist, they want affordable gas and electricity,” McConnell noted. “The American people don’t want a bloated IRS, they want stronger support for law enforcement at the southern border and their communities. Washington Democrats have consistently misunderstood what the American people have asked them to do.”Meanwhile, Americans are still struggling to buy gas, food and other basic needs. Reports say more than half of Americans are admitting they are struggling financially while nearly 60 percent are reportedly living paycheck to paycheck. Financial experts also say this is affecting the middle class a lot harder than before inflation began lift-off.Additionally, retirees are lamenting they have had to go back to work over their depleted incomes, which couldn’t stretch further amid the inflation of the dollar. In the meantime, while Wall Street and top government officials can tout a slight downturn of inflation and gas priced, doom still looms for America’s economy.An economist at the Federal Reserve warned a severe recession is nearing as the Fed is mulling over a new batch of interest rate hikes. This has caused many officials, including New York City Mayor Eric Adams, to warn of future belt tightening among their governments in anticipation of a rocky road to economic recovery.The Consumer Price Index report appears to shows a recession is an impending phenomenon, which likely can’t be avoided.","American flags hang outside of the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2021.

(Photo by STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:08 AM PT – Tuesday, September 13, 2022The mayor of a small Illinois town is reeling after dozens of migrants are bussed to his town without notice. Elk Grove Village Mayor Craig Johnson said he recently received a call from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker’s office, informing him ”a bus” full of migrants would be arriving in the city that evening.When he asked for more information such as how many migrants and which hotel they were headed to, Johnson said the office claimed “no details were available.” The small town mayor then questioned whether these migrants had been subjected to any health screenings or background checks, but given no answer. Johnson said he would provide food and water for the migrants, but not allow them off the bus.“We started doing some homework. The State of Texas has no clue where Elk Grove Village is. They were not going to Elk Grove Village. They were going to the city of Chicago. She wants to probably say politically: ‘I’m a sanctuary city. I welcome you with open arms.’ But when reality checks, if five bus loads shows up in her city, she can’t handle it. So let’s give them to Elk Grove Village. That’s wrong…We’re not against migrants. We’re not against helping them, but we should work together. Our frustration is, no well-advance knowledge, no involvement in communication discussing how we can handle it.” –Mayor Craig Johnson – Elk Grove Village, Illinois This comes as Illinois Democrat leadership, including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot have attempted to play off the influx of migrants from Texas as ”racism” by Texas Governor Greg Abbott.","Migrants, who boarded a bus in Texas, listen to volunteers offering assistance after being dropped off within view of the US Capitol building in Washington, DC, on August 11, 2022.
