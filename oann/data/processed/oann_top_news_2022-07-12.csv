(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:58 AM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would have been fired if he were president for misleading Americans about inflation. During an interview Sunday, the Republican stressed a recession is, in fact, coming.“You cannot add $5 trillion onto America’s balance sheet and just hope it goes away,” he stated. “The recession is coming. The Fed, I think, has known this for a while. They have kind of ignored it. They should have been easing us into the right rates and where we need to go over a year ago.”Sununu asserted that Yellen completely misled the American people and didn’t want to “own the bad news.” He added, the Biden administration needs to stop telling Americans a recession isn’t inevitable.“You had a Treasury secretary who was saying, ‘oh well, it’s not inevitable.’ ​Of course, it’s inevitable,” he continued. “You don’t need four-years at Dartmouth economics to know that. When you add that $5 trillion, there has to be some outcome.”Notably, Sununu said low-income families and others on fixed incomes are going to suffer this coming winter with home heating costs expected to soar past record rates. He took to Twitter to note, “inflation is the worst tax on the poor that bad management can bring and that’s exactly what the Democrats in Washington have done.” Several other Republican lawmakers have echoed these sentiments.Joe Biden isn’t spending America to prosperity, he’s spending us into a recession.— Senator Michael Rulli (@michaelrulli) July 6, 2022Yellen previously shifted the responsibility of dealing with inflation away from the White House by claiming the Federal Reserve is responsible for dealing with the American economy. Prior to this, Yellen had suggested the Biden administration was running out of options to address its mishandling of the economy.","FILE – Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, on June 8, 2022.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:21 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022The Los Angeles Department of Elections determined the petition to recall District Attorney George Gascon has enough signatures to trigger an election. In a press release Saturday, the voter registrar stated the raw count of recall petition signatures was 715,833. A total of 567,000 valid signatures are needed to trigger a recall which the department will verify by a random sample of the signatures turned in by petition organizers.“As authorized in the California Elections Code, the RR/CC will use the random sampling technique for the verification of petition signatures,” said Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan. “The random sample is 5 percent of the total number of signatures submitted. Based on the random sampling results the petition will be certified as sufficient, require verification of all signatures submitted, or certified as insufficient. If the petition meets the sufficiency requirement the RR/CC must certify sufficiency to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors at its next regular meeting.”The earliest a recall election could take place is November 8 in a general election that includes runoff races for Los Angeles city mayor and county sheriff, as well as congressional midterms. If it’s put to a vote more than 50 percent of voters would have to vote to oust Gascon.“The concept that these changes were made solely because of the outside pressures, I know it may appear to be that way, but I can tell you it’s much more nuanced than that,” voiced Gascon. “Frankly, regardless of where the recall goes, there will be additional adjustments.”BREAKING: Los Angeles Voter Registrar (Dept of Elections) has determined the raw count of recall petition signatures to be 715,833 , way above the threshold for recall. The Dept has til Aug 17 to now validate the signature sample to conclude that the recall tally has succeeded. pic.twitter.com/W3hwH7W3fC— Richie Greenberg (@richieSF2016) July 9, 2022Growing frustrations with Gascon have centered on his all or nothing policy stances. On his first day in office, Gascon barred prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, trying juveniles as adults and filing sentencing enhancements. This increased the amount of prison time a defendant will face in certain situations, including if they use a gun in the commission of a crime.An attempt to recall Gascon failed last year when the recall campaign was unable to garner enough signatures on a petition to put the issue to voters.","Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon in San Francisco, California.

The Sun recently obtained Hunter Biden’s text messages, in which he expressed his hatred towards Jill and said even at his drunkest he is smarter than she is. The text messages were uncovered on an iPhone that was found backed up on Hunter’s laptop.“You do know the drunkest I’ve ever been is still smarter than you could ever even comprehend and your a grammar teacher that wouldn’t survive one class in a ivy graduate program,” Hunter expressed.Reportedly, the conversation took place between Hunter and Beau Biden’s widow Hallie who Hunter was dating at the time. In another text to his uncle, Hunter bemoaned that his own father allegedly hadn’t visited him during his prior rehab stints.“Literally has never come to one and never actually called me while in rehab,” Hunter wrote of his father. “So that’s a little insane.”Viewer discretion advised: Hunter Biden, the smartest man Joe knows, having a mental breakdown.pic.twitter.com/zd4WyCTrne— Wendell Husebø (@WendellHusebo) July 11, 2022On July 4, Hunter and Jill were pictured arriving together at Fort McNair with Joe and Hunter’s family for Independence Day celebrations.

I love you, tell mom I love her and I’m sorry I say mean things. I don’t mean them.”This vitriol appeared to be spurred by Jill Biden requesting the drug and alcohol addicted former lawyer return to rehab.","File – Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, is pictured.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:22 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called for a national ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. His remarks on Sunday, come in wake of a mass shooting in Highland Park where a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens of others during a Fourth of July parade.According to Rep. Bob Morgan (D-Ill.), “everything is on the table.” Morgan was marching in the Highland Park parade on Monday with his wife, 4-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son when the dozens of shots rang out just two blocks away. The Deerfield Democrat said he ran toward the scene and is grappling with the traumatic aftermath of the bloodshed.“If anyone’s going to reject any single solution, well they’re going to hear about that from me,” Morgan said. “And so, everything has to be on the table and we have to look at this as a comprehensive problem because it really is a comprehensive problem.”The gun epidemic is not just a Chicago or an Illinois problem. This is an American problem. The bipartisan compromise is a start but it is not enough. We must end the NRA’s stranglehold on Washington, ban assault weapons, and close the gun show loophole.— Lori Lightfoot (@LoriLightfoot) July 9, 2022The 21-year-old suspect’s parents reportedly entrusted him with military-style rifles at a young age and he passed four background checks for a gun license despite past police encounters.Pritzker’s office is looking at everything from training and education about the Firearm Restraining Order or the “Red Flag” law designed to keep guns away from those deemed a danger to themselves or others. They are also putting into state statute the amount of time a “clear and present danger” file should be kept, even if it’s unfounded.“It’s a pretty simple bill. It bans military style weapons and high-capacity magazines,” stated Rep. Maura Hirschauer (D-Ill.). “The general public in Illinois has clearly said that those types of weapons are designed for the battlefield not for hunting or any reasonable use. We are moving forward with it. I’m working it from the ground up, roll calling, gathering support and just really doing my homework on it.” Pritzker said he doesn’t think weapons should be in the hands of the general public.","Illinois Gov.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:05 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022President Joe Biden defended his upcoming meeting with Saudi leaders despite outcry from critics. In a Washington Post op-ed allegedly written by Biden, the president asserted his commitment to upholding human rights.However, he argued that he has to position America to take on Russia and China. He claimed bolstering ties with Saudi Arabia will help do that. The Saudi Royal Family, especially crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman have been suspected of aiding the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the recent mass executions of political prisoners.“I know that there are many who disagree with my decision to travel to Saudi Arabia,” Biden said. “My views on human rights are clear and long-standing. Fundamental freedoms are always on the agenda when I travel abroad as they will be during this trip, just as they will be in Israel and the West Bank.”Additionally, critics have condemned Biden’s recent attempts to reach out to the Saudi government to beg for oil exports amid his war with American energy companies. Biden said the Middle East he will be visiting is more stable and secure than the one his administration inherited 18 months ago.“As president, it is my job to keep our country strong and secure,” he voiced. “We have to counter Russia’s aggression. We have to put ourselves in the best possible position to outcompete China and work for greater stability in a consequential region of the world. To do these things we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes. Saudi Arabia is one of them and when I meet with Saudi leaders my aim will be to strengthen a strategic partnership going forward that’s based on mutual interests and responsibilities, while also holding true to fundamental American values.”Biden will be the first president to fly from Israel to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. He claimed his travels will be a small symbol of the budding relations and steps toward normalization between Israel and the Arab world, which his administration has worked to deepen and expand.He is expected to visit Saudi Arabia on Friday during his tour of the middle east.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, July 8, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:30 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022A new study from Italian researchers find that COVID booster vaccines are less than 20 percent effective in combating the virus. The recent study also found that vaccines are less than 25 percent effective against symptomatic disease after only a few months. It directly contrasts between what Doctor Anthony Fauci and other top scientific researchers have said. They claimed that boosters were 75 percent effective against preventing the spread of the Omicron variant.“Our booster vaccine regimens work against omicron,” Fauci said. “At this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster.”According to White House COVID response coordinator Jeff Zients, the unvaccinated are eight times more likely to end up in the hospital and 14 times more likely to die compared with people who are fully vaccinated. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said 36 states have detected Omicron so far and the variant makes up about 3% of COVID cases nationwide.“And so the message remains clear,” Fauci voiced. “If you are unvaccinated get vaccinated and particularly in the arena of Omicron, if you are fully vaccinated get your booster shot.”Fauci said the initial two dose series is incapable of maintaining the initial standard. According to the Doctor, the booster dose was made to “keep people healthy,” but it rapidly fades to half that percentage against symptomatic illness.As of July 7, 260.3 million people have received at least one dose of a #COVID19 vaccine. Of those, 222.5 million are fully vaccinated.

A new Breitbart report showed Texas Border Patrol agents apprehended around 26,000 migrants in less than a week who crossed into border towns.The recent spike in arrests prompted Governor Greg Abbott (R-Texas) to sign an “invasion” executive order allowing the Texas National Guard and Texas DPS to send those migrants back to the border where they can return to Mexico. He and other GOP politicians have piled blame onto the Biden administration for failing to secure the southwestern border.“While President Biden refuses to do his job and enforce the immigration laws enacted by Congress, the State of Texas is once again stepping up and taking unprecedented action to protect Americans and secure our southern border,” said Abbott. “The cartels have become emboldened and enriched by President Biden’s open border policies, smuggling in record numbers of people, weapons, and deadly drugs like fentanyl.”The arrests took place in the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, Del Rio, Big Bend and El Paso sectors. According to Monday’s report, of the 26,000 migrants apprehended 10,000 were in the Texas border town of Eagle Pass. The Del Rio border sector saw the largest share with 12,000 migrants being apprehended by border agents there.“As the challenges on the border continue to increase, Texas will continue to take action and address those challenges,” he stated.I issued an Executive Order authorizing the Texas National Guard & Texas Dept. of Public Safety to return illegal immigrants to the border.Cartels have become emboldened by Biden's open border policies.Texas is taking unprecedented action to STOP this criminal enterprise. pic.twitter.com/ag08ACYP3Y— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) July 7, 2022In addition, 70 percent of the migrants apprehended in Texas were single adults.","FILE – A line of Texas Department of Safety vehicles line up on the Texas side of the Rio Grande with Mexico visible, right, near an encampment of migrants, many from Haiti, on Sept. 22, 2021, in Del Rio, Texas.

Repeat the line.""This is getting embarrassing for our country. pic.twitter.com/SWh0cJqzOI— Brian Mast (@BrianMastFL) July 8, 2022In a Truth Social post on Sunday, 45th President Donald Trump noted there are a lot of people Biden’s age and older who are as good and sharp as ever. However, Trump said Biden is not one of them. Trump stressed that Biden’s cognitive and mental problems have nothing to do with his age and he quipped life doesn’t truly begin until 80.To add fuel to the fire, it appears Biden has become the most hated president in the past 75 years as America faces deepening economic and social crises. According to FiveThirtyEight polling Monday, Biden’s approval rating of 38 percent is the lowest among all presidents since 1945 except Harry Truman.Back in 1946, Truman’s rating was 33 percent. This can be compared to Trump’s rating of 42 percent at the same point in his presidency along with Richard Nixon’s rating of 54 percent and Dwight Eisenhower’s rating of 70 percent. The poll also shows Republican presidents fared better during their second year in office than their Democrat counterparts.","President Joe Biden speaks during an event to celebrate the passage of the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” a law meant to reduce gun violence, on the South Lawn of the White House, Monday, July 11, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Vice President Kamala Harris suggested American citizens should not have access to certain firearms and called for further restrictions. In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Harris was asked about the recent assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.“I was shocked for so many reasons,” Harris said. “Beginning with the fact that Prime Minister Abe was a great friend to the United States through many administrations. Our President Joe Biden is very, very fond of him and knew him well.”She offered condolences and addressed the troubling nature of his death, but did not comment on Japan’s strict gun laws. Instead she steered the conversation to the US and declared that no American would own a high powered rifle unless they had plans to murder people.“Assault weapons were specifically and intentionally designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly,” she stated. “It is a weapon of war. If you’ve ever looked at, if I may be so blunt, an autopsy photograph to see what it does to the human body. The fact that we can’t get Congress to renew.  It’s not like we’re pulling something out of our hat. We’ve done it before as a nation to renew the assault weapons ban, is outrageous.”We cannot allow our nation to live in fear of gun violence anymore. The Senate must pass commonsense gun laws and protect the people of this country. The time for change is now. pic.twitter.com/2K1Q0UyOfO— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 9, 2022The Democrat went on to suggest that if the weapons weren’t legally available mass shootings wouldn’t happen. Although Democrats control both chambers of Congress, any major gun reform legislation would require 60 votes in the Senate. That means that at least 10 Republicans would have to sign on to legislation for it to be viable.“We have to stop allowing those weapons to be available to civilians living in communities who have a right to believe that they are not in a war zone,” she voiced.The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is long overdue.This law will take reasonable steps to help prevent gun violence in America. And it will save lives.— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 11, 2022The Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, specifically outlawed 19 types of semi-automatic firearms, as well as other rifles, shotguns and handguns that possess two or more of a certain set of features. This included pistol grips, detachable magazines and sound suppressors. The maximum capacity of a magazine was also set at 10 rounds. The vice president went on to speak about her experience visiting Highland Park in Illinois where the tragic July 4 mass shooting took place.“You can support the Second Amendment, I support the Second Amendment,” she expressed. “But we should agree we should not have weapons of war on the streets of America. Sadly a toddler lost both his parents. When I got to the scene I was greeted by the mayor, the chief and the first responders who told me that story. I can’t even imagine what this is going to mean for the life of that child.”The call for common-sense gun violence legislation is long overdue. Today we celebrate the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. https://t.co/YhxKmfvBHX— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 11, 2022Harris said recent suspects have been able to slip past “red flag” laws simply because guns are available. She voiced that Congress must reinstate the so-called assault weapons ban of 1994.","Vice President Kamala Harris speaks as President Joe Biden looks on, during an event to celebrate the passage of the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” a law meant to reduce gun violence, on the South Lawn of the White House, Monday, July 11, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/John Locher)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:00 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Republican nominee for Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo claimed the sitting Democrat Governor Steve Sisolak was the “original de-funder of the police.”In a recent Breitbart interview, the Clark County Sheriff revealed that while Sisolak was chairman of Clark County Commission, he orchestrated a “no” vote twice on a police funding tax initiative. The sheriff said this effort made it hard to hire more police officers years ago.“Even though it was a voter approved initiative,” Lombardo stated. “It was voted in by the citizens of the state of Nevada yet it was stopped by the Chairman of the County of Commission, which was in fact Steve Sisolak.”Lombardo continued to slam the governor for his soft on crime approach with his Democrat-controlled state legislature. The Republican stated the governor didn’t push back and veto these bills so he’s responsible for their passage.Grateful for the opportunity to discuss critical public safety issues tonight.

In an interview Sunday, he was asked about his thoughts on protesters following Justice Brett Kavanaugh to dinner.This came after his husband, Chasten, wrote on Twitter “sounds like he just wanted some privacy to make his own dining decisions,” seemingly referencing the recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh has been threatened previously, most recently by a suspected gunman from California.Sounds like he just wanted some privacy to make his own dining decisions. https://t.co/pAUiYqxIHT— Chasten Buttigieg (@Chasten) July 8, 2022Nonetheless, Buttigieg expressed no public figure is free from criticism or peaceful protests.“The Justice never came into contact with these protesters, reportedly didn’t see or hear them,” stated the Transportation Secretary. “And these protesters are upset because a right, an important right the majority of Americans support, was taken away. Not only the right to choose by the way, but this justice was part of the process of stripping away the right to privacy.”Buttigieg said while he thinks public figures should be “free from violence, harassment and intimidation” no one should be free from criticism and peaceful protests.","FILE – Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg listens at an event in Philadelphia, on Jan. 14, 2022.
