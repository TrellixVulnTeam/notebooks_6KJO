During a Tuesday interview, he asserted no thriving democracy that respects the right to vote would end up with a total abortion ban..@BetoORourke: “In 1973, Jane Roe, a TX woman, as were her two attorneys, successfully prevailed upon an all-male SCOTUS to win protection for the right to privacy…The women of TX won that right 50 years ago, the women of TX will win it back in 2022.”  https://t.co/82revBnr8l pic.twitter.com/i9k2tESMn2— Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) August 23, 2022His remarks comes as the state’s trigger law is set to take effect Thursday. It includes a near-total ban where those performing the procedure could face a life sentence and $100,000 fine. Meanwhile, a poll conducted by the Texas Politics Project in June showed 78 percent of voters said an abortion should be available in at least some situations.“Jane Roe, of course, a Texas woman as were her two attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, who successfully prevailed upon an all-male United States Supreme Court to win protection for that right to privacy to make these very personal and sometimes painful decisions,” stated O’Rourke. “The women of Texas won that right 50 years ago. The women of Texas will win it back in 2022.”Meanwhile, recent polling from the Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas shows Republican Governor Greg Abbott is up seven points over O’Rourke.","FILE – Democrat Beto O’Rourke listens to a volunteer before a Texas Organizing Project neighborhood walk in West Dallas in this June 9.

(AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)APOAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:50 PM PT – Tuesday, August 23, 2022Former President Donald Trump appears to be enjoying a surge in popular support, following the FBI invasion of his Mar-a-Lago home. According to a poll by NBC News, Trump’s popularity among Republican voters increased by seven-points since the raid. Forty-one percent of voters said they identify with Trump more than the GOP, which is up from 34 percent before the raid.This data comes after a report by  found the Biden administration was conspiring with the National Archives since April to force Trump to return all materials he had from his presidency. Meanwhile, Trump is suing the federal government to force officials to give him back all items stolen from his property.“The White House stated strongly that they were NOT INVOLVED, and knew absolutely nothing about, the political Witch Hunt going on with me, & that they didn’t know anything at all about the Break-In of Mar-a-Lago. This was strongly reiterated again & again. WRONG! Remember, these are the people who spied on my campaign, denied it, & got caught. Through the great reporting of John Solomon (Fake Pulitzer Prize?), documents reveal they knew everything, in fact led the charge – a political NO, NO!”— Donald Trump via Truth SocialFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis recently chimed in on the matter, stating the Biden DOJ and FBI are weaponized against political opponents of the Democrats. In an interview Tuesday, America’s governor said the FBI raid of Donald Trump’s home appears to be politically motivated.“So the FBI has a history now of weaponizing its power to go after people that it doesn’t like…they went after Donald Trump specifically with Russia collusion, even when he became president and they were basically trying to drive him out of office based on a conspiracy theory,” he noted.DeSantis added, Trump has been the target of federal agencies since running for president in 2016 and Democrats went after him based off the Russia hoax, which turned out to be a debunked conspiracy theory. The governor stressed federal agencies have become the enforcement arm of Democrats against everybody else.“You have seen FBI agents falsify FISA applications to get surveillance on innocent Americans,” he explained. “We’re seeing what’s happening with this Michigan kidnapping hoax, which is a total disaster for the bureau. You look at what’s happened with having FBI agents surveil parents going to school board meetings. Who would have ever thought that?”DeSantis also made a joke about his recent conversations with Trump, saying the Biden DOJ and FBI would leak their communications to the New York Times.","Former President Donald Trump departs Trump Tower, Wednesday, Aug. 10, 2022, in New York, on his way to the New York attorney general’s office for a deposition in a civil investigation.

They took my passports. They even brought a “safe cracker” and successfully broke into my personal safe, which revealed…nothing!”The 45th president announced that his legal team is demanding the DOJ to halt the “review of documents illegally seized” from his Mar-a-Lago estate. They are also requesting the DOJ appoint a special master to “oversee the handling of the materials taken in the raid.” “We are further demanding that the DOJ be forced to turn over a REAL, without ‘plants,’ inventory of my property that was taken and disclose where that property is now located,” Trump said. “We are demanding that all items wrongfully taken from my home be IMMEDIATELY returned.”BREAKING: Pres.

10:43 AM PT",Judicial Watch Files Taxpayer Lawsuit over Racially Discriminatory Minneapolis Teachers’ Contract,"Judicial Watch Files Taxpayer Lawsuit over Racially Discriminatory Minneapolis Teachers’ ContractJudicial Watch — RELEASEUPDATED 10:43 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch announced today it filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Minneapolis taxpayer over a teachers’ contract that provides discriminatory job protections to certain racial minorities. The lawsuit was filed against the superintendent of the Minneapolis Public Schools, the Minneapolis Public Schools, and the Minneapolis Board of Education for violating the Equal Protection Guarantee of the Minnesota Constitution (Clapp v Cox et al. (No. 27-CV-22-12454)).The controversial contract was agreed to in March 2022 to end a 14-day teacher strike. The Minneapolis Federation of Teachers ratified the contract shortly after the agreement was reached. The Minneapolis Board of Education ratified it in May of this year.The Judicial Watch lawsuit states:Among other things, the contract provides preferences, protections, and privileges for MPS teachers of certain races and ethnicities under a section entitled “ARTICLE 15. PROTECTIONS FOR EDUCATORS OF COLOR.” There is no similar provision covering educators who are not “of color.”Under the contract, teachers of color are exempt from Defendant MPS’s seniority-based layoffs and reassignments, which means, when layoffs or reassignments occur, the next senior teacher who is not “of color” would be laid off or reassigned. In addition, the contract mandates that Defendants reinstate teachers of color over more senior teachers who are not “of color.”Upon information and belief, prior to the contract, teachers were laid off or reassigned in order of seniority, with the least senior teachers laid off or reassigned first, without regard to race or ethnicity. Similarly, teachers were reinstated in order of seniority, with the more senior teachers reinstated first, without regard to race or ethnicity.Article 15’s preferences, protections, and privileges for certain public-school teachers on the basis of race and ethnicity violates Minnesota’s Equal Protection Guarantee, which states that “no member of this state shall be disenfranchised or deprived of any of the rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof, unless by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers.” Minn. Const. art. 1, § 2. The Equal Protection Guarantee is analyzed under the same principles and mandate as the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.The lawsuit asks the court to enter a judgement that will declare that all actions taken to implement the racial and ethnic preference provisions of Article 15 of the contract to be illegal. They are also asking that the court declare it illegal to use any taxpayer dollars to implement these provisions of the contract, and the defendants be prohibited from taking any actions to implement these racial and ethnic provisions.“It is incredible that in this day and age a school system would engage in blatant racial discrimination in employing teachers,” stated Judicial Watch Tom Fitton. “The courts can’t move soon enough to shut down this extreme leftist attack on the bedrock constitutional principle that no one can be denied equal treatment under law on account of race.”Judicial Watch is being assisted in the lawsuit by Daniel N. Rosen of Rosen LLC in Minneapolis, Minnesota.In a separate case, the city of Asheville, NC, in January 2022 settled a Judicial Watch federal civil rights lawsuit after agreeing to remove all racially discriminatory provisions in a city-funded scholarship program. Additionally, the city also agreed to remove racially discriminatory eligibility provisions in a related program that provides grants to educators.In May 2022, Judicial Watch won a court battle against California’s gender quota law for corporate boards. The verdict came after a 28-day trial. The verdict followed a similar ruling in Judicial Watch’s favor in April finding California’s diversity mandate for corporate boards unconstitutional.TOPICS:Judicial WatchMINNEAPOLISMinneapolis Public SchoolsMinnesotanewsOANOANNpolitics SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/judicial-watch-files-taxpayer-lawsuit-over-racially-discriminatory-minneapolis-teachers-contract/

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:08 AM PT – Tuesday, August 23, 2022The US State Department said it’s still on top of getting WNBA star Britney Griner released, five-months into her detention at a Russian prison.On Monday, spokesman Ned Price spoke out against reports indicating former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman was traveling to Russia to negotiate Griner’s release. Price went on to claim Rodman’s actions could complicate talks with Russia. The official urged the public to trust the Biden administration to get the job done.However, the State Department has allowed A former New Mexico governor to negotiate the releases of Trevor Reed from Russia and other Americans held captive in Myanmar. This occurred despite them not being employed by the US government for more than 20 years. Additionally, late last year, the Biden administration was criticized by families of Americans detained abroad for not even being able to get meetings with White House officials.Despite this, Price reiterated the tried and true method will work. He stressed, no unofficial envoy will bypass the efforts of US diplomats.“I want to be clear, he is, he would not be traveling on behalf of the US government,” said the spokesman. “I’ve just reiterated what we’ve said now for the past several weeks. We put forward a substantial proposal to Russia to seek the freedom of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. We believe that anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder those release efforts. We’ve also provided very clear guidance to American citizens owing to a number of threats, not the least of which is the threat of wrongful detention that Americans should not travel to Russia. That has been our message to private Americans across the board.”NBC News reported over the weekend that Rodman had told the outlet he was going to travel to Russia this week. Rodman has been known to hold informal talks with leaders who are at odds with the Washington establishment.His relationship with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un paved the way for talks between the nation and the Trump administration in 2018 that were seen as the first sign of hope that North Korea could lay down its nuclear arms in years. Rodman said at the time, he was going to keep pushing for peace with America’s adversary, despite being criticized by past administrations and mainstream media outlets.In the meantime, Giner faces nine-years in prison after being found with hashish oil in her possession at a Russian airport, while retired Marine Paul Whelan has been incarcerated in 2018 on allegations of spying. Diplomats are offering to exchange arms dealer Viktor Bout in a prisoner swap to bring the two Americans home.Meanwhile, critics of the Biden administration are calling out officials for paying this much attention to Griner, pointing out Joe Biden and Kamala Harris led efforts to incarcerate massive amounts of Americans for similar crimes.","Former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman arrives at Singapore’s Changi Airport on Tuesday, June 12, 2018.

And the American people have an urgent right to know how the Biden administration manufactured the records dispute used as a pretext for the raid on Trump’s home,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The Biden administration’s unlawful secrecy on its political raid of Trump’s home speaks volumes.”In a separate case, Judicial Watch has moved with some significant success to unseal all warrant materials, including the affidavit used to justify the raid.On August 22, Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart handed down a decision that partially grants Judicial Watch’s request to unseal the affidavit and other materials. He states in the ruling that “given the intense public and historical interest in an unprecedented search of a former President’s residence, the Government has not yet shown that these administrative concerns are sufficient to justify sealing.”TOPICS:Department of JusticeDOJFOIAJudicial WatchJustice DepartmentNational ArchivesnewsOANOANNpolticisRecords Administration SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/judicial-watch-files-foia-lawsuit-against-national-archives-for-hiding-records-tied-to-raid-on-trumps-home/

Dr. Fauci announced plans to step down in December after holding the position since 1984For Republicans, however, this in no way means Fauci is off the hook. In an interview Monday, House Oversight Ranking Member James Comer (R-Ky.) said retirement will not shield Fauci from congressional scrutiny.

6:38 AM PT",CAUGHT! Biden White House Directly Involved in Trump DOJ Probe MONTHS Before Raid,"CAUGHT! Biden White House Directly Involved in Trump DOJ Probe MONTHS Before RaidChanel Rion, OAN Chief White House CorrespondentUPDATED 6:38 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022Biden White House has been in talks with the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) criminal probe into Donald Trump for months – contrary to what the White House has claimed. Government documents reviewed by Just the News this week expose major holes in the Biden White House narrative.Newly reviewed memos between the Biden White House and the FBI, DOJ, and the National Archives show the White House as early as April was involved in discussions surrounding Trump’s papers and documents. According to documents reviewed by Just the News, then White House Deputy Legal Counsel Jonathan Su this May told the National Archives President Biden would “not object to waiving [President Trump’s] claims of executive privilege.”This statement from Joe Biden’s White House served as the green light for DOJ to procure a subpoena demanding Trump return papers from his presidency that might be at Mar-a-Lago.A May 10 letter from Acting National Archivist Debra Steidel Wall to Trump’s legal team confirmed the White House’s role and prior knowledge in the DOJ probe against Trump:“On April 11, 2022, the White House Counsel’s Office — affirming a request from the Department of Justice supported by an FBI letterhead memorandum — formally transmitted a request that NARA provide the FBI access to the 15 boxes for its review within seven days, with the possibility that the FBI might request copies of specific documents following its review of the boxes,” wrote Wall.Wall goes on to justify ignoring Trump’s executive privilege citing President Biden himself:“The Counsel to the President has informed me that, in light of the particular circumstances presented here, President Biden defers to my determination, in consultation with the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, regarding whether or not I should uphold the former President’s purported ‘protective assertion of executive privilege.’ …I have therefore decided not to honor the former President’s ‘protective’ claim of privilege.”These correspondences confirm the Biden White House directly participated in a process key to empowering the DOJ raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence on August 8.Ultimately, these revelations cast doubt on statements by Biden officials claiming no advance knowledge of the raid and raise more questions about what Biden officials did know prior to the August 8 raid.TOPICS:Chanel RionDebra Steidel WallDOJDonald TrumpFBIJoe BidenMar-a-LagoNational ArchivesnewsOANOANNpoliticsPresident TrumpprobeRAIDWhite House SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/caught-biden-white-house-directly-involved-in-trump-doj-probe-months-before-raid/

(MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:27 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022A new report reveals a connection between the alleged kidnapping plot of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago. According to Just the News, FBI official Steven D’Antuono is in charge of the bureau’s field office in Washington that raided 45th President Donald Trump’s Florida home.Back in 2020, D’Antuono was in charge of the Detroit office when the Whitmer kidnapping case took place. The report cites a trial testimony which says the Detroit FBI office “instigated, encouraged and facilitated” the Whitmer plot.Republican officials say both the Whitmer case and the Trump raid show the FBI is weaponized for political purposes. GOP officials, like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, say both the Whitmer case and the Trump raid show the FBI is weaponized for political purposes.“We’re seeing what’s happening with this Michigan kidnapping hoax, which is a total disaster for the bureau,” DeSantis noted. “You look at what’s happened with FBI agents surveil parents going to school board meetings. Who would have ever thought that? So I think when Republicans look at that and they’re upset about it, it’s against the backdrop of that conduct where basically there agencies have become the enforcement arm of one particular faction our country against everybody else.”Suspects in the Whitmer case, Adam Fox and Barry Croft, were convicted Tuesday although they were acquitted in April on the grounds they had been entrapped by the FBI.","A crest of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is seen 03 August 2007 inside the J.

McCabe, OAN National CorrespondentUPDATED 6:38 AM PT – Wednesday, August 24, 2022Florida Republican Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis rallied Friday in a packed-out Pittsburgh ballroom for the Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial nominee looking to succeed Democratic Gov. Thomas W. Wolf less than 90 days from Nov. 8 election day.“Our message to Pennsylvania is clear, and we have a stark choice,” said state Sen. Douglas V. Mastriano (R.-33), facing the Democratic nominee Attorney General Joshua D. Shapiro.“We had the continuation of eight years of failed policies, vis-a-vis Tom Wolf in the form of Josh Shapiro, who’s for six years has been our attorney general, and as our senior law enforcement official, the state crime has gone up 37 percent, overdose deaths, we’re number eight in the nation, 12th in homicides, fourth specifically in fentanyl deaths,” the retired Army colonel said.Mastriano said in addition to his failure at the commonwealth’s attorney general, Shapiro has personal failings that should preclude him from holding public office. “He’s a failure. He’s ambitious. He’s a vain glorious man looking for his own glory and he’s done nothing with the job he had at hand.”The rally with DeSantis was part of the governor’s “Unite and Win” tour, sponsored by Turning Point USA, the political wing of the conservative youth organization led by its founder Charlie Kirk.“We are thrilled that Gov. Ron DeSantis from Florida came up to campaign with us. Pennsylvania is the Keystone State,” the state senator said.When Mastriano took the stage, accompanied by his wife Rebecca, he wasted no time telling the faithful what to expect from his administration.“On day one, all executive orders and mandates or restrictions that destroy businesses and infringe upon your freedoms will be over,” he said.“I’ll be rolling back over one-third of the regulations in the first 100 days of my administration,” he said. “I will hold state officials accountable for enforcing law and prosecuting crime–that’s right. I will have the backs of our beautiful law enforcement.”The state senator, whose district includes the home and library of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, said he had a special plan for the planeloads of illegal aliens President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sends into the Keystone State.“Pennsylvania will not be host to illegal immigrants anymore—and when those ghost flights show up in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania State Police will greet them and escort them to Joe Biden’s house in Delaware,” he said.When DeSantis took the stage, the crowd erupted, and the governor took it from there, taking on the leftists trying to rework America’s culture.“This woke ideology is a really destructive mind virus. And what it’s done is it is infecting different institutions in our society, the medical establishment,” he said. “That’s why they’re doing these sex changes on the minors, or they want to do it.”It is also going on in the schools, he said.“You see it in education. You see it in these different things. It’s a very oppressive ideology. It’s totally divorced from reality,” DeSantis said.“We can’t just stand idly by while woke ideology ravages every institution in our society. We must fight the woke in our schools. We must fight the woke in our businesses. We must fight the woke in government agencies,” he said. “We can never ever surrender to woke ideology—and I’ll tell you this, the state of Florida is where woke goes to die.”After he wound up the crowd, DeSantis then sent the whipped-up activists out with his marching orders.“So, put on the full armor of God, take a stand against the left schemes. Stand your ground. Stand firm. Don’t back down. We can do this,” he said.“I’m going to be working to keep the state of Florida free and you guys have an opportunity to make Pennsylvania free.
