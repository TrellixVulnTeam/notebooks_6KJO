According to tracking data from flightradar24.com, the 43 year old aircraft took off from Pokhara at 9:55 a.m. and transmitted its last signal at 10:07 a.m., at an altitude of 12,825 feet.Air accidents are not uncommon in Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Everest. Nepali terrain and weather patterns make flying particularly difficult.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:29 AM PT – Friday, May 27, 2022Senate Republicans blocked a domestic terrorism bill while asserting it would dangerously expand the government’s surveillance powers. On Thursday, the measure failed along party lines. At least 10 Republican votes were needed to advance.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced the bill in response to a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo. It would have created new federal offices to increase focus on domestic terrorism threats in coordination with Homeland Security, the DOJ and the FBI.Republicans have been skeptical of the legislation. They believe the bill could lead to the policing of political speech and claimed it’s an updated version of the Patriot Act to surveil Americans. Democrats have tied the issue to firearms and are pushing for gun control, while echoing calls for the measures approval following the massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called the bill an insult to every police officer in the country.“This is a filtration of the uniformed services and federal law enforcement,” Paul said. “This is not just an insult to your local police or to the marines, to the army, to the navy, his is an insult to the FBI, its an insult to the capital police. This bill says that they’ve been infiltrated. This says that our police are consumed with some kind of race rage. It’s untrue, it’s slander, it’s scandalous.”The bill was not expected to pass after it received GOP support in the House. It only gained one Republican vote from Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) slammed Republicans in his push to get the bill passed.“Many Republicans have made their opposition clear,” stated Schumer. “There are a lot of MAGA Republicans for whom no amount of gun violence, whether it’s domestic terrorism, a school shooting, a neighborhood shooting or something else, will ever, ever convince them to take any action.”Today, the Senate is voting on the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act to help combat a serious cause of gun violence:Domestic terrorism and white supremacyIt will give the government the tools to monitor, find, & arrest evil actors before they have a chance to inflict violence— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) May 26, 2022Schumer voiced he will hold bipartisan negotiations in the Senate in the coming weeks to try and hammer out a compromised bill.","Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., looks over his notes before speaking to reporters at a news conference following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 24, 2022.

Spurred by the Tuesday, May 24, 2022, deadly elementary school shooting in Texas, California senators approved giving citizens the power to sue those who traffic in illegal firearms, mimicking a Texas law that is intended to deter abortions. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:28 AM PT – Tuesday, May 31, 2022The Second Amendment is apparently up for debate in Washington, D.C. as lawmakers attempt to signal they are doing something about gun violence. On several corporate news outlets, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle put in their two cents on how to make sure another mass shooting like the one in Uvalde, Texas doesn’t happen again.While appearing on CNN, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said he would support a number of gun control measures, including banning bump stocks, AR-15’s and raising the minimum age to buy guns. He said his philosophy on gun control evolved after seeing mass shootings in Las Vegas, Parkland High School in Florida and Buffalo, New York.Kinzinger went on to flip-flop on whether he supports a full ban of so called assault weapons, while emphasizing his preferred measures as added qualifications.“You know, fairly recently, I think I’m open to a ban now,” he stated. “It’s going to depend on what it looks like because there’s a lot of nuances on what constitutes certain things, but I’m getting to the point where I have to wonder maybe for somebody to own one maybe you need an extra license, maybe you need extra training. So the question is: is it a ban or additional certification?”Meanwhile, Senate Democrat Whip and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin believes “different feeling” among his colleagues on gun reform. Durbin has claimed red flag laws could be adopted as well as a crackdown so-called “straw purchases,” where people with clean criminal records buy guns then give them to criminals. He also claimed bans on so-called assault weapons work and said the number of Americans who have AR-15s is alarming.“Well, when we had one, there was a reduction in crime, in mass shooting with these weapons,” he noted. “That expired years ago and unfortunately in the meantime, there’s been dramatic increase in purchases of these weapons. The AR-15 that was used by this individual in Uvalde, there are now 20 million of those owned by American across the nation to put it in perspective.”Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) went so far as to say mass shootings in school will dissipate when Americans love their kids more than they love their guns.“Until the redemptive power of the love for all of our children is greater than the destructive power of the love of our guns and money and power…until that until the redemptive love of our children turns into action, then nothing is going to change,” he stated.However, retired Navy SEAL, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) said many of the proposals in Washington, D.C. won’t work. He claimed establishing red flag laws attempts to enforce the law before it’s broken and questions the standards that would make a gun purchaser a “threat.” Crenshaw also challenged raising the minimum age to buy a gun by warning lawmakers will just keep raising the age limit after each mass shooting. Instead, he urged lawmakers to focus on bolstering background checks and school safety.“A lot of these policies that the Democrats often propose, these gin control policies, they do two things,” said Crenshaw. “One, they infringe of the rights of millions and millions of gun owners. And two, they probably wouldn’t have the outcome that you’re hoping for. So if you’re not going to get the benefit that you want, but it’s going to come at great costs, it generally means it’s not a good policy.”Additionally, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) urged lawmakers to look at reducing gun violence commonsensically. The Republican, who led an NRA task force, said banning specific weapons like AR-15s is tricky because lawmakers would have to distinguish problematic properties that could be found in other long guns or pistols. He added, AR-15s have been around long before they were used in mass shootings and believes lawmakers should be looking into the people behind these shootings.“I want to give a little bit more history; AR-15s were around for 40 years before they were ever used in any type of mass killing or attack,” explained Hutchinson. “And so, it is about the human heart. It is about identifying the culprits and going after them and I think it is a discussion you can have.”Legal scholar Jonathan Turley echoed this point while stressing landmark precedent, including District of Columbia v. Heller, cemented Americans’ right to keep and bear arms. Turley pointed out that Democrats push gun control legislation that fails in the courts and ends up strengthening Second Amendment protections.","FILE – An ATF agent poses with homemade rifles, or “ghost guns,” at an ATF field office in Glendale, Calif., on Aug. 29, 2017.

(AP Photo/Meg Kinnard)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:13 AM PT – Tuesday, May 31, 2022South Carolina congressional candidate Katie Arrington put incumbent Rep. Nancy Mace on blast ahead of the state’s primary election. In a recent interview, Arrington accused Mace of turning her back on 45th President Donald Trump and being a RINO.Previously, Mace blamed Trump for inciting the January 6 capitol protest and voting to certify Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election despite his support of her 2020 congressional campaign.“Since that time, Nancy has done nothing but cozy up to the Democrats and the radical left to, you know, promote her moderate, you know, liberal agenda,” Arrington asserted. “I mean, she literally is a RINO in every sense of the word and this district has had enough.”Additionally, the Trump endorsed candidate accused Mace of flip flopping on several issues such as the COVID-19 vaccine. Arrington also called her opponent desperate and claimed she was willing to say anything to get re-elected.“She goes on Fox one day to talk about how, you know, everyone should be aware of their natural own immunity and that, you know, only take the vaccine if needed,” explained the congressional candidate. “And then goes in the same outfit to CNN and says, you know, vaccine mandates mandatory and goes to MSNBC to say the same thing.”Arrington then went on to slam Mace for expressing optimism for the US under Biden despite high inflation and the current baby formula shortage.“I don’t understand where she’s coming from and what bizarro world she lives in,” Mace stated. “We have record high inflation, record high gas prices. It’s disgusting, the fact that our country has a baby formula shortage. We’re the greatest country on the planet and yet the federal government under the Biden leadership has driven it to the point where babies are going hungry in our own country, and she thinks this is optimistic.”South Carolina’s Republican primary is expected to take place on June 14.","Former South Carolina state lawmaker Katie Arrington speaks at a rally ahead of an appearance by former President Donald Trump on Saturday, March 12, 2022, in Florence, S.C.

The President also seemed to call for a ban on one of the most common handguns in America.“He said, ‘a 22 caliber bullet will lodge in a lung and we can probably get it out, may, and save the life,” he stated. “A nine millimeter bullet blows the lung out of the body.

(AP Photo/Olivier Matthys)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:36 AM PT – Tuesday, May 31, 2022The European Union agreed to ban almost 90 percent of Russian oil by the end of this year. The council reached a consensus on the latest sanctions at its summit in Brussels on Tuesday.All Russian oil imports by sea will be banned under the motion, but fuel transported via pipeline will still be imported by EU member states. European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the inconsistency, but voiced intentions of blocking all Russian oil from the Eurozone in the future.“And indeed, here we have agreed this is for the moment being exempted,” she stated. “We have agreed that the council will revert to the topic as soon as possible in one way or the other, so this is a topic where we will come back to and where we will still have to work on.”The move follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s demand for the EU to terminate its purchasing on Russian fuel as Europe receives 40 percent of its natural gas and 25 percent of its oil from the Russian Federation.I welcome the #EUCO agreement tonight on oil sanctions against Russia. This will effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year.— Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) May 30, 2022Von de Leyen also announced the removal of Russia’s largest bank and several institutions from the SWIFT financial transaction system.“This is good that we now de-SWIFT the Sberbank,” she continued. “There is a ban on insurance and re-insurance of Russian ships by EU companies, a ban on providing Russian companies with a whole range of business services and very important, the suspension of broadcasting in the European Union of three further Russian state outlets that were very typically spreading broadly the misinformation that we have witnessed over the last weeks and months.”The new sanctions, which must be approved by all 27 member states, are expected to be enacted on Wednesday. The measure was initially proposed early this month, but was stonewalled by Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic over energy security concerns.","Belgium’s Prime Minister Alexander de Croo, left, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen talk before the second day’s session of an extraordinary meeting of EU leaders to discuss Ukraine, energy and food security at the Europa building in Brussels, Tuesday, May 31, 2022.
