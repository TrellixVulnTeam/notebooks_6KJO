9:28 AM PT",Biden staff rushes to his defense amid outcry over Saudi trip,"President Joe Biden’s national security staff is rushing to his defense amid outcry over his recent trip to Saudi Arabia. During an interview Monday, White House spokesman John Kirby stressed the US and Saudi Arabia are deeply entangled. The Coordinator for Strategic Communications added, the Biden administration has enormous interest in the kingdom and could not pass up a meeting with the Crown Prince.His comments comes as critics have lambasted Biden for begging Saudi Arabia for oil and being friendly with its leadership, despite calling it a “pariah state” on the campaign trail. However, Kirby claimed Biden’s Middle East tour was integral in advancing his agenda and asserted it will yield some positive results.“They (the meetings) produced results and they will probably produce results in the future that are in the best interest of the American people,” he stated. “The President went on this trip because it was in the national interest that he do it.”The White House aid went on to say Biden and the Crown Prince came together on several issues, including efforts to denuclearize Iran. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre faced tough questions about Biden’s trip to the Middle East and his talks with Saudi leadership.During a press briefing Monday, she defended Biden while echoing his claims that he was tough to those he spoke to and discussed human rights with them. Her remarks came despite the foreign minister and Saudi leadership denying Biden had any such conversation with them.""Does the president still believe that Saudi Arabia and the crown prince should be considered 'a pariah'?""KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: *word salad* pic.twitter.com/tI8cYj4G0c— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 18, 2022Jean-Pierre was asked if Biden still labels Saudi Arabi as a “pariah” despite the meeting, but played off the question by saying Biden has already addressed it. The President has not been clear with Saudi Arabia’s status, only saying he doesn’t regret labeling them a “pariah” during the campaign.","FILE – Pentagon spokesman John Kirby speaks during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:39 AM PT – Tuesday, July 19, 2022President Joe Biden’s economy czar, Jared Bernstein, appeared to admit inflation wasn’t transitory, while still asking the country to trust its policies moving forward. On Monday, Bernstein held a press conference to showcase the 34th day of declining fuel costs. He touted the price of gas has dropped 50 cents per gallon since its June peak and reassured the public the trend should continue so long as circumstances remain favorable.“We think it’s reasonable to expect more gas stations to lower their prices in response to lower input costs and thus, barring unforeseen market disruptions to see average prices fall below $4 per gallon in more places in coming weeks,” stated the economic adviser.However, the press raised concerns about Bernstein’s forecast as officials have promised inflation was transitory, only for rates to continue hovering at 40-year highs. The adviser downplayed such worries, trumpeting a number of factors to bolster his claim that the Biden economy is robust.“So I think if you look at the strength of the current economy, if you look at the strength of the labor market, if you look at the strength of consumer spending, you would conclude that where we are right now remains solidly within expansion,” he claimed. “I think we can confidently say that these numbers that we’re posting are very much inconsistent with a recessionary call given where we are right now.”However, members of the press refused to relent pointing to Biden’s refusal to take credit for any of the economic woes that have taken place during his presidency. Bernstein shot back by disagreeing with their assessment and praising Biden’s policies.“I think what’s happening here is a President who is working tirelessly to address the largest constraint, probably the toughest constraint facing American households right now: the the budgetary impacts of these elevated prices,” stated the economy czar. “And we’re showing you here today some real results.”﻿The price of gasoline remains more than $2 higher per gallon than when Biden first took office. Although the President has often blamed Russia for the pain at the pump, prices had already risen a dollar per gallon prior to the invasion of Ukraine.A March study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank found found half of the inflation rate in quarter four of last year had been triggered by bloated pandemic spending packages. Nonetheless, the Biden administration seems to be telling Americans to be grateful for a slight decline in gas prices as the population continues to feel pain in their pockets.","Council of Economic Advisers member Jared Bernstein speaks at a press briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, July 18, 2022.

While speaking at an event hosted by The Hill Tuesday, Fauci dismissed a recent Politico report claiming he was going to retire by the end of President Joe Biden’s term.However, Dr. Fauci said he does not see himself staying in his current position, regardless of who is occupying the White House next. He also said he can still contribute to medical research at the federal level. His comments come as the nation’s highest paid unelected bureaucrat  has come under immense scrutiny over the past few years for his positions on vaccine and mask mandates as well as funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab in China.Dr. Fauci is currently 81-years-old and has been working for the federal government for over 50 years. He has been at the NIAID since 1984 and has spent the majority of his career studying HIV, Ebola and other highly infections diseases. In 2020, Fauci became the face of the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where he advocated universal masking, economic lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations.Meanwhile, government watchdog Judicial Watch is taking legal action against the Biden administration while seeking the records of NIH official Christine Grady, who is the wife of Dr. Fauci.

However, the Mayor did add that his heart goes out to the hard-working and honest Alba.“I am hoping that we take all of that into consideration as this hard-working New Yorker was doing his job and someone aggressively went behind the counter to attack him,” Adams stated. “I support hard-working, innocent people that are doing their job.”The United Bodegas of America and Yemeni American Merchants Association has been lobbying for Albas’ charges to be dropped, while explaining his act of self-defense was justified.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Pres.

The organization first received national attention when it fought against mask mandates in schools and later when it opposed curriculum related to LGBTQ rights, race and discrimination.“There are a lot of really nice and well-meaning people there,” DeVos voiced. “I don’t mean to disparage them in any way, but they are definitely oriented around being in their roles for probably most of their careers, if not all of them.”… says the guy who needlessly kept schools closed for nearly two years, because the union bosses made him.Putting parents in charge of education decisions wouldn't ""destroy"" public education.

During an event organized by the American Institute Enterprise last month, DeVos described dealing with an agency full of career bureaucrats.“Really for any of the creative reforms that we advanced we really had to essentially work around most of the career staff,” she said. “Because there were very few who would actually get the work done that needed to be done or would present options that weren’t even close to what we were attempting to do.”Former Secretary of Education @BetsyDeVos tells me she had a plan to ABOLISH the Department of Education and return the power to parents, but Congress wasn't interested: ""Bottom line, there was no action taken.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:19 AM PT – Wednesday, July 20, 2022House Republicans are worried that President Joe Biden will further cripple the US economy and the well-being of Americans. This comes as the majority of voters disapprove of Biden’s handling of key issues. That’s according to GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) who made the comment during a press conference on Tuesday.“Seventy-three percent of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of inflation, 57 percent of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of energy, and 59 percent of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of the border crisis and illegal immigration,” she stated.Yet, she added, House Democrats reportedly want to discuss everything except the crises facing the country. This comes as House Democrats are working to pass a dozen spending bills through the House before the august recess.Additionally, Stefanik slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (R-Calif.) and House Democrats for putting their “socialist wish list” ahead of the challenges the nation is already facing. GOP members pointed out that their spending bills have more spending than usual.“Twenty percent increase for the EPA…30 percent increase for the Federal Trade Commission, 20 percent increase for OPM (Office of Personnel Management ) and 433 percent increase for election security grants,” explained Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.).However, the bottom line here, according to Republicans, is you cannot address inflation by increasing spending. While Republicans have said they want to work with Democrats to address these key issues, it seems as though Democrats want to govern the country alone resulting in the nation’s current economic state.“This is not a coincidence, this is what happens when one party Democrat rule fails America,” Stefanik asserted.House Republican Leadership Stakeout:﻿","Newly-elected House Republican Conference Chair Rep.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:25 AM PT – Wednesday, July 20, 2022Multi-billionaire Elon Musk may have been right about Twitter’s fake account problem. Bots may have influence on real world events from Hollywood to Capitol Hill and beyond.According to Rolling Stone magazine, the film “Justice League: Snyder Cut” got a major boost on social media due to activity by what appears to be inauthentic spam accounts. The report said Director Zack Snyder was actively pushing Warner Brothers for his version of the film to come to fruition as a legion of fans mobbed the studio to the same end on social media.However, the movement was not entirely organic as two reports from Warner Media found bots constituted 13 percent of accounts actively promoting the “Snyder Cut” across the Twitterverse. Although it was apparent Snyder’s fan base was largely human, bots were a contributing factor in pushing a studio to spend $100 million on a re-cut of a film that had bombed at the box office in 2017.Fake accounts also helped prop up the Biden-Harris presidential campaign’s presence on social media, according to a Newsweek report. Within two weeks of Biden selecting Harris to be his running mate in August of 2020, his follower count eclipsed 730,000. This was more than a 9 percent jump. Before November of that year, Biden was sitting at more than 11 million followers. Not only was the rise unusual, but a disproportionate number of accounts were linked to users in rural India.Furthermore, a Zenger News investigation found a large portion of new accounts inflating Biden’s social media presence during his candidacy were linked to troll farms based in India. Such entities manage multiple accounts and provide a number of analytics-skewing services such as increasing follower counts or flooding comments sections.All of this adds to the debate of bots on social media right after Musk terminated the deal to acquire Twitter. Musk said the number of bots on its platform is at least 20 percent while the company claims it’s only 5 percent, in turn, sparking a legal dispute.20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.This deal cannot move forward until he does.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022Although the the social media giant claims it has “bent over backwards” to be transparent, Musk is accusing the platform of not being upfront with crucial user data.

McConnell: Democrats’ Reckless Plan To Rob Americans A Second TimeSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:42 PM PT – Tuesday, July 19, 2022Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is sounding the alarm on Democrats’ proposals that he asserts would cripple Americans physically and financially. While speaking on the Senate floor Monday, the Senate Minority Leader warned Democrats are gearing up to jam through its latest proposal to curb inflation, adding that means more spending and higher taxes on the American people.The Kentucky Republican explained that Democrat rule in Washington, D.C. has already caused decades high inflation and skyrocketing gas prices, which is being felt by Americans in all tax brackets.“Workers in blue collar industries are among those having the hardest time keeping up,” he stated. “US manufacturing workers are seeing their lowest average earnings adjusted for inflation since 2014, while the overall private sector workforce showing wages at 2019 levels. Unfortunately, these hardships show little sign of slowing anytime soon.”Additionally, the Kentucky Republican said Democrats’ healthcare proposals aim to put more bureaucracy in between Americans who need care and healthcare providers. He pointed out Democrats want to implement price control measures targeting the medical industry, which is a move he said could bleed billions-of-dollars in research and development for life saving treatments and drugs. McConnell further lamented price control laws could result in lower life expectancy in the US and adds calls for government interference is hugely misguided.“There’s no Washington magic wand, trust me,” he satetd. “Or else we’d have every American driving $1 pickup trucks and eating $1 steaks just by passing a law setting those prices at $1. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”﻿In the meantime, other senators believe the American people are seeing what happens to the federal government when it is controlled by the Democrat Party and they want a change. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) believes this midterm season will be a “bloodbath” for Democrats. Recent polls show Americans aim to turnout big for the GOP this coming November with Biden’s influence in the economic, border and international crises being top concerns.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022.
