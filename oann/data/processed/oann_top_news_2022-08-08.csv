He said that 37 people have died and thousands more left homeless, but progress is being made in stabilizing communities.However, Beshear said people in the region aren’t out of the woods yet. Storms on Friday will be capable of producing very heavy rainfall rates, prompting the Weather Prediction Center to issue a slight risk level of excessive rainfall for the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys into the Mid-Atlantic. For portions of Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia, WPC says Friday is “more of a higher end slight risk with isolated to scattered flash flooding likely, but less confidence on a more widespread/organized risk.”“Biggest concern today is weather we have a slow moving thunderstorms that could lead to heavy rainfall at times through Saturday,” said Beshear. “Rain and thunderstorms could lead to isolated scattered instances of flash flooding in eastern Kentucky today and tonight. And more rain is forecast through midweek.”Thunderstorms could produce locally heavy rainfall today and Saturday, where instances of flash flooding is possible. pic.twitter.com/CghbYaobmq— NWS Jackson KY (@nwsjacksonky) August 5, 2022The governor said officials were focused on conducting wellness checks Friday due to concerns about slow moving thunderstorms that could lead to heavy rainfall on Saturday. He added that nine cooling centers remain open in different counties as heat conditions are expected to increase after the storm.Beshear said President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit east Kentucky on Monday to meet with families affected by the devastation of the flooding and survey recovery efforts at the local Disaster Recovery Center, operated by the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management and Federal Emergency Management Agency.“While we have thousands that lost their home that we need to stabilize, steady progress is being made and real, significant progress especially over the last eight days,” Beshear stated.The governor also warned of an impending high heat wave coming in behind the rain reminding residents that there are cooling centers open in case of power outages.","Bonnie Combs stands by and watches her property become covered by the North Fork of the Kentucky River in Jackson, Ky., Thursday, July 28, 2022.

The Madison County School District said it will begin storing AR-15 rifles in emergency safes at five of their schools.“We were able to put an AR-15 rifle and safes in all of our schools in the county,” Sheriff Buddy Harwood told the Asheville Citizen-Times. “We’ve also got breaching tools to go into those safes. We’ve got extra magazines with ammo in those safes.”The sheriff’s department believes the new measure will ensure responding officers will be more prepared in the event of a school shooting. This comes after the where Uvalde Police waited 77 minutes in the hallway.“Those officers were in that building for so long, and that suspect was able to infiltrate that building and injure and kill so many kids,” said Harwood.The schools where the safes will be located are Brush Creek Elementary, Hot Springs Elementary, Mars Hill Elementary, Madison Middle, Madison High and Madison Early College High. Madison County Schools Superintendent Will Hoffman said that the system’s administration has been in regular contact with Harwood and the rest of the police department about school security.“I hate that we’ve come to a place in our nation where I’ve got to put a safe in our schools, and lock that safe up for my deputies to be able to acquire an AR-15. But, we can shut it off and say it won’t happen in Madison County, but we never know,” he said.Madison County school district in North Carolina is putting AR-15 rifles in emergency safes in all of its schools for increased security in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead on a 4th grade classroom floor.— Ryan Shead (@RyanShead) August 6, 2022Gun violence overall spiked in 2020, but recent statistics indicate it is coming down this year in many cities.","MIAMI, FL – DECEMBER 18: In this photo illustration, a Rock River Arms AR-15 rifle is seen with ammunition on December 18, 2012 in Miami, Florida.

On Saturday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida among thousands of attendees observed the deaths of 140,000 citizens who lost their lives in 1945. Kishida also announced Hiroshima will be hosting next year’s G7 summit where officials hope to rally world leaders behind a pledge of denuclearization.“Tens of thousands of people were killed in this city in the blink of an eye,” said UN head Antonio Guterres. “Women, children and men were incinerated in a hellish fire.”In Hiroshima to mark the 77th anniversary of the atomic bombing, I met young activists who tirelessly carry the message of peace forward to a new generation.The world must never forget what happened here. pic.twitter.com/2eQbQv8z0q— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) August 6, 2022Before dawn, survivors and their relatives began to gather at Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park to offer flowers and prayers. A silent prayer was held at 8.15 am, the moment the bomb was dropped. The Russian ambassador was not invited to the ceremony but visited Hiroshima on Thursday to lay flowers at the memorial site. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, President Vladimir Putin has made thinly veiled threats hinting at a willingness to deploy tactical nuclear weapons.In a speech on Saturday, Hiroshima mayor Kazumi Matsui cited Leo Tolstoy, the Russian author of “War and Peace” and said “Never build your happiness on the misfortune of others, for only in their happiness can you find your own.”Three days after the Hiroshima bombing, Washington dropped a plutonium bomb on the Japanese port city of Nagasaki, killing about 74,000 people and leading to the end of World War II. The United States remains the only country ever to have used nuclear weapons in conflict.The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was also in attendance and spoke alongside Kishida.","Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga (L) pays his respects during a ceremony to mark the 76th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bomb attack at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima on August 6, 2021. – Japan OUT (Photo by STR / JIJI PRESS / AFP) / Japan OUT (Photo by STR/JIJI PRESS/AFP via Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234493426-e1628275217377.jpg, Ky.

Chinese officials accused her of meddling in China’s internal affairs.In addition to targeting the House Speaker, China decided to halt cooperation with the US on several pressing issues, including transnational crime.This announcement comes as Biden administration officials said Pelosi’s trip was peaceful and claimed China’s military drills in response to the Speakers visit are extreme and unjustified. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken touched on the topic.“The United States has conveyed to the PCR consistently and repeatedly that we do not seek and will not provoke a crisis,” said Blinken. “(Taiwan) President Tsai said the same thing.

(AP Photo/LM Otero)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:00 PM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called out the progressive left at this years CPAC after he was welcomed to CPAC with a standing ovation. Speaking at the event on Thursday, Orban accused progressive liberals of trying to silence him and attempting to keep him away from the event.“They did not want me to be here and they made every effort to drive a wedge between us,” said Orban. “They hate me and slander me and my country as they hate you and slander you and the America you stand for. We all know how this works. Progressive liberals didn’t want me to be here because they knew what I would tell you. Because I’m here to tell you that we should unite our forces.”He then went on to suggest that today’s progressive left is equivalent to Nazi’s and communist dictators by trying to move the US away from Judeo-Christian values. Orban, who came to power in 2010, has increasingly clamped down on political opposition and press freedom, consolidating his power further over the last two elections.  During his speech, Orbán also attacked Jewish billionaire George Soros, former President Barack Obama, “globalists” and the Democratic Party. He went on to voice, “They hate me and slander me and my country, as they hate you.”“The horrors of Nazis and communism happened because some western states in continental Europe abandoned their Christian values,” he voiced. “Today’s progressives are planning to do the same. They want to give up on western values and create a new world, a post-western world. Who is going to stop them if we don’t?”🇭🇺🤝🇺🇸PM Orbán opens @CPAC calling for conservatives to unite forces & fight for a bright(er) future in the West.

Politics, my friend, are not enough. This war is a culture war. We have to revitalize. We have to revitalize our churches, our families, our universities and our community institutions.”A day before his appearance at CPAC, Orbán and his delegation met with former President Donald Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Szijjártó also commented in a tweet that Hungarian-US relations were “at their peak when Donald Trump was President” and expressed the hope that he’ll be president again. .45: Great spending time with my friend, Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary.

Speaking to the media from the White House Friday, Biden appeared optimistic about securing her release.“We call on President Biden and the United States government to redouble their efforts to do whatever is necessary and possible,” the Rev.

Her sentencing could now pave the way for a prisoner swap between Griner and Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in Illinois. The result is a painful quandary for the Biden administration as it tries to maintain a hard line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over his war in Ukraine.“There’s nothing good here,” said Andrea Schneider, an expert on international conflict resolution at Cardozo School of Law. “No matter what Biden does, he’s going to be criticized. Either that we’re giving too much or we’re not working hard enough.”Brittney Griner being sentenced to 9 years in jail over cannabis is egregious.@POTUS must do everything in his power to get her back to the US.He also must correct that injustice here in America, too.

But analysts called that unlikely anytime soon.“I don’t think this is going to get resolved quickly,” said Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer who represents Americans held by foreign governments. “I think the fact that Putin has not said yes right away means that he’s looked at the US offer and said, ‘Well, that’s their first offer. I can get more than that.’”That US offer first presented to Russia in June. They sought the release of Ms. Griner and Paul N.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:14 AM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022The Biden administration has paired up with Big Business to promote its latest social spending bill. The President said a Democrat-backed spending binge will combat inflation, but hundreds of economists disagree.On Thursday, Joe Biden held a virtual conference with representatives of large businesses and labor unions to promote his so-called Inflation Reduction Act. He claimed the mega corporations had American families’ best interests at heart by putting their weight behind the bill. The Delaware native touted the multiple ways he alleged Americans will save money from health care to effects from the so-called climate crisis.“The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug prices, lowers health insurance premiums, invests in clean energy that will create jobs and economic opportunities for business and labor, reduces the deficit, and makes common sense reforms to our corporate tax code,” claimed the President. “These are the facts”.Biden praised the bill in tandem with the recently passed CHIPS Act, which the Democrat proclaimed would bolster clean energy investments and American manufacturing.“They see how already because of our work over the last 18 months, American manufacturing is coming back stronger than ever,” he stated. “Where is it written that America can’t lead the manufacturing in the world? Six-hundred, thirteen-thousand manufacturing jobs created just since I took office, the most created in three decade.”When we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, working families will get rebates to buy efficient appliances and weatherize their homes. And folks will have tax credits for efficient heating and cooling and rooftop solar.Families will see their energy bills drop by the hundreds.— President Biden (@POTUS) August 5, 2022However, analysts are less optimistic about the bill than Mr. Biden. Two-hundred, thirty economists penned a letter to House and Senate leadership warning the spending package will serve as gasoline for red hot inflation. The economists warned the spending tax hikes will serve as a one-two punch to the economy, boosting demand while handicapping supply.Furthermore, they asserted the suggested minimum corporate tax rate would suffocate a supply chain on life support, while medical price controls will stifle innovation. In a subsequent interview with Fox’s Larry Kudlow, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called the bill a “complete fraud” because it will fail to attack inflation, while serving as shrapnel to taxpayers and businesses.“That the subsidies to Obamacare include people $304,000 a year,” Graham noted. “That doesn’t sound like helping the poor and it also says the 15 percent minimum in tax that you described will create distance to build factories, buy equipment during a recession. Now who in the right mind wants to tax and spend during a recession?”Democrats, however, shot back at the bill’s skeptics by producing a letter signed by 126 economists in support of the spending binge. The bill’s ambitions were once thought to be extinguished until Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) came to an agreement on the measure with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) With Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) vocalizing her support for the legislation, it’s almost certain to pass through reconciliation.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022.

(AP Photo/Arleigh Rodgers)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:30 PM PT – Sunday, August 7, 2022Indiana lawmakers move forward with a pro-life law in light of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade. On Friday, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb signed a near-total abortion ban into law during the final day of the state legislature’s two-week special session.The law grants exceptions for the procedure for cases of incest and rape before 10 weeks post-fertilization. This only if giving birth harms the mother and if the fetus shows signs of a deadly illness. This brought on the ire of Democrats and other abortion activists with the White House calling the move “devastating” and continuing to call the US Supreme Court extremist.“Following the overturning of Roe, I stated clearly that I would be willing to support legislation that made progress in protecting life,” Holcomb said. “In my view, SEA 1 accomplishes this goal following its passage in both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly with a solid majority of support.”On Thursday, the Indiana House rejected Republican-sponsored amendments that would have removed the exceptions for rape, incest and fatal fetal anomalies from the bill. Members of House Republican leadership were divided as Speaker Todd Huston and Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Karickhoff voted against the amendments, while Majority Leader Matt Lehman backed the amendments.Indiana passed a near-total abortion ban yesterday. By the time a woman realizes she's pregnant, she will effectively be prohibited from having access to reproductive health care. This is an absolutely shameful decision made by the Indiana legislature and governor.— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) August 6, 2022White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre slammed the new law in a statement Saturday, calling the bill’s passage “another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women’s reproductive rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.”#NEW: Eli Lilly, one of Indiana’s largest employers and headquartered in Indianapolis, says because of the near-total abortion ban just passed in the state it will be “forced to plan for more employment growth outside of our home state.”#AbortionBan pic.twitter.com/tlIngH6JOt— Max Lewis (@MaxLewisTV) August 6, 2022Indiana is the first state to approve an abortion ban after the landmark Dobbs decision.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 3:16 PM PT – Sunday, August 7, 2022China is sending military jets near Taiwan as part of its ongoing military drills prompted by Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) visit to the island last week. The Chinese Military released video footage Sunday, showing heavy bombers and fighter jets apparently flying around Taiwan. Taiwan’s defense ministry said 20 Chinese aircraft and 14 warships conducted missions around the Taiwan Strait on Saturday afternoon.China said the drills come in defense of its territorial integrity which it said was jeopardized by Pelosi’s recent visit. Experts pointed out that Taiwan may struggle to secure military aid in case of a Chinese takeover.“Taiwan is not recognized as an independent country,” said retired Air-Vice Marshal Sean Bell. “It’s very close to China and as a result it seems highly unlikely that the west would come to the aid. It’s very difficult to conclude through all of this that China feel even more emboldened by the results and the fallout from this exercise.”China sends 20 more fighter jets and support aircraft near Taiwan joining 14 warships for an ‘air-sea operation’ in latest show of force. 158 Chinese warplanes have been launched over the past five days: Taiwan MoD— Lucas Tomlinson (@LucasFoxNews) August 6, 2022#BREAKING #CHINA #TAIWAN🔴 CHINA :#VIDEO CHINESE TROOPS FIRED LIVE ARTILLERY SHELLS NEAR THE TAIWAN STRAIT DURING A MILITARY EXERCISE!

Speaking to CNN on Sunday, Abrams said she would back Biden if he chooses to run for office again.Her statements are in spite of a recent CNN poll which showed three out of four registered Democrats said they don’t want him to run for re-election. Additionally, Abrams shared what she would tell Biden if he came to her for guidance while also touting her latest attempt to run for public office.The mounting controversy has brought several Democrats to outright say they do not support him for the 2024 race. Abrams on Sunday said if Biden were to call her to announce he was running, she would tell him to “do his best job.”“I’m going to tell him to do his best job and that right now our focus has to be on what’s happening,” said Abrams. “But yes, if President Biden chooses to run again, I absolutely support him. But my responsibility is to make for certain that we protect women.”The current governor has failed to take real action to help our families or to address climate change.

Organizers at the CPAC convention in Dallas, Texas announced Saturday that Trump won the presidential straw poll with 69 percent of the vote.  This is reportedly a 10 percent jump from when conservatives voted in the Florida CPAC convention earlier this year. Trailing him with a large gap was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis with 24 percent of the vote. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) came in third place with two percent, while other choices received one percent support or less.Just 0.3% of CPAC goers say they would vote for Mike Pence in a 2024 presidential primary — and that number stays the same even when you ask the question without Trump as an option. pic.twitter.com/JUECpysC5z— Natalie Allison (@natalie_allison) August 6, 2022Despite DeSantis gaining attention as a possible alternative to Trump as the 2024 GOP nominee, Trump has consistently dominated CPAC’s informal straw polls since he left office last year.Former President Trump arrives at @CPAC to a roaring crowd.

He received 70 percent support in the straw poll taken at a second CPAC convention last July.President Trump has been leading the charge to nominate America First candidates to Congress and State legislatures, with most of his picks winning the GOP primaries so far.
