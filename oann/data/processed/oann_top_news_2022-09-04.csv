(AP Photo)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:31 PM PT – Friday, September 2, 2022Joe Biden’s primetime address is drawing support and criticism as it targeted Americans who voted for Donald Trump. Critics have pointed out POTUS promised to unite the country, but did the opposite with his extreme message targeting MAGA Republicans. Biden went as far as to say they are semi-fascists and a threat to democracy.What he failed to address is top issues facing Americans. This includes inflation out pacing wages, a record amount of fentanyl and individuals on the terrorist watch list coming across the southern border, the violent crime wave in cities, decades of student progress in reading an math erased, and the censorship of dissenting fact-based opinions.A recap in case you missed Biden’s speech: Nothing to lower inflation. Nothing to reduce crime.Nothing to secure the southern border. All division, no solutions.— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) September 2, 2022On the contrary, supporters said this was the speech they were waiting for the President to make as he called out the attempts to decertify the 2020 election results and showed backbone. aMeanwhile, Biden has appeared to get roasted by left-wing media mainstays for delivering a divisive political speech with Marines in uniform behind him. Biden’s so-called “battle for the soul of the nation” speech Thursday night is not getting the roaring applause he may have hoped for.A CNN reporter was one of many to point out that the military is meant to be kept apolitical and Biden stood in front of two Marines, disparaging half the country. She said “positioning Marines in uniform behind President Biden for a political speech flies in the face of that.”Angry. Divisive. Political. Stubborn. Failure. pic.twitter.com/33cMtmPlmV— Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) September 2, 2022The White House has dismissed these concerns while claiming Biden’s speech was not political.

While speaking on Bush-era Communications Director Nichole Wallace’s MSNBC show on Thursday, Brennan said it was “bizarre” that Trump took the particular documents he took to Mar-a-Lago. This comes despite the DOJ and FBI releasing a heavily redacted affidavit on the raid of Trump’s home. It has not been indicated what was actually seized.Brennan is currently being targeted in the Durham probe into the Crossfire Hurricane operation. The operation tried to get to the bottom of the Obama White House, CIA and the FBI’s efforts to spread the Russia collusion narrative.“I’m sure that Mar-a-Lago was being targeted by Russian intelligence and other intelligence services over the last 18 to 20 months,” Brennan said. “If they were able to get individuals into that facility and access those rooms where the documents were and made copies of those documents, that is what they would do. They wouldn’t steal the documents, they would make copies, and they would put them back exactly where they were. So now the intelligence community has to try to determine if they were compromised.”In the meantime, the Trump legal team is trying to get a special master appointed to the case against him. Critics warn that the Biden DOJ will not fairly review the evidence.","WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 23: Former Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) John Brennan testifies before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on Capitol Hill, May 23, 2017 in Washington, DC.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-687321060.jpg, House Minority Leader McCarthy: Biden Doesn’t Understand Soul Of AmericaTOPICS:CIADOJFBIJohn BrennanMar-a-LagonewsOANOANNpolitics SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/john-brennan-claims-russia-spied-on-mar-a-lago/

The agency noted that at least 97 people nationwide have been infected with an outbreak of a strain of the virus.While it has yet to be confirmed, many of the infected said they ate sandwiches from the fast-food restaurant which contained romaine lettuce before becoming sick. Victims in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana have all reported symptoms of E. coli. Their symptoms include bloody stool, stomach cramps and other gastrointestinal issues. Ebone Colbert, a woman who is a victim to these symptoms, spoke about her recent experience with the virus.“The doctor told me if I had tried to fight this off at home, I could have died, actually,” Colbert said. “Tuesday morning around 5 a.m., I started having bloody diarrhea and called my doctor and he told me to go to the emergency room. I did get a call from the state of Michigan Health Department. They told me it was E. coli and they didn’t know where it came from.”In response, Wendy’s released a statement announcing they had removed what they believed to be the affected products.

Lawmakers scrambled to pass hundreds of new bills before its end.Assembly Bill 2098 is the first of many measures heading to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk. The bill would allow the State Medical Board to discipline physicians spreading so-called COVID-19 misinformation.

It will require companies such as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to install “guardrails” for users under the age of 18. That includes not collecting location data for minors.Lawmakers also passed Senate Bill 846. The bill keeps the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant open until 2030. That date is five years beyond the shutdown date that was scheduled prior. Six of the Governor’s seven climate and energy bills were able to pass, including new restrictions for oil and gas drilling.On the other hand, multiple controversial bills were dropped or failed to pass. Senate Bill 866 would have allowed teens to get a vaccine without parental consent.

(J. Scott Applewhite, File/AP Photo)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:04 AM PT – Friday, September 2, 2022House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is taking Democrats to task for their track record over the past year and a half. The California lawmaker specifically blasted Joe Biden, saying the President doesn’t understand the soul of America.On Thursday, McCarthy held a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania ahead of Biden’s Philadelphia address to feign national unity. He accused Biden of attempting to distract from the problems his reign has created rather than solving them. The GOP leader scoffed at the Biden administration’s push for so-called green energy, while their fossil fuel policies have pulverized the working class.“He inherited energy independence from President Trump, but is now traveling the world begging foreign countries for energy to power our country,” he noted. “We have God given American-made energy we need right here, right now, but Joe Biden has locked it away and raised the price of gas.”McCarthy zeroed in on the administration’s pledge to allow equity to guide every policy decision made by the White House. The Republican dared to ask how that idealistic goal has been achieved.“Is it fair that historic inflation is causing Americans to get second jobs or go into credit card debt to pay for groceries or to drive their daughter to get chemotherapy?” he asked. “Of course, it is not. It’s cruel and honest Americans know this.”However, McCarthy claimed Biden doesn’t particularly care for certain Americans. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Americans who do not hold an allegedly majority opinion are “extreme.” She asserted Biden’s targeting of “MAGA office holders” would not be a political speech. McCarthy challenged the White House’s rhetoric, however, while claiming the self-proclaimed “great unifier” owes half the population an apology.﻿﻿The Republican asserted Mr. Biden’s soul of America represents Washington insiders and elitists. To McCarthy, America’s soul can be found in the people that built this nation and propel it into the future.","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responds to reporters at the Capitol in Washington D.C.

(AP Photo, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:54 AM PT – Friday, September 2, 202277-years ago today, President Harry Truman declared September 2nd V-J Day as Japan formally surrendered resulting in the end World War II.While scenes of Japan in World War II recalled images of Iwo Jima, there was no warfare in the Tokyo Bay on this day in 1945. Instead of picking up weapons, representatives only picked up pens to formalize Japan’s surrender to allied forces.The Battle of the Pacific had tilted to allied favor in the summer of 1945. In June, Americans forces captured Okinawa. In August, the United States dropped a pair of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities. On August 15th, Japan’s Emperor went on national radio to announce his surrender. The US accepted the surrender and set September 2nd as the day for a formal surrender ceremony.On this day in 1945, 250 allied warships anchored in the Tokyo Bay as representatives from 10 countries boarded the USS Missouri as General Douglas MacArthur gave an opening address.“We are gathered here, representatives of the major warring powers, to conclude a solemn agreement whereby peace may be restored,” General Douglas MacArthur said.  At 9:05 local time, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu was the first to sign. General MacArthur gave his autograph at 9:08. Nine more representatives would sign and in less than 20 minutes six years of world war finally came to a complete close.While many Americans celebrated after the Emperors surrender in mid-August, President Truman officially declared September 2nd as ‘Victory in Japan Day’ as World War II — the bloodiest conflict of the 20th century — officially came to a close.","FILE- In this Sept. 2, 1945, file photo, Admiral Chester W.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 4:17 PM PT – Saturday, September 3, 2022Authorities in Michigan are investigating how a voting machine that went missing following the election wound up for sale online. According to a statement from the State on Friday, the machine was purchased by a cyber-security expert in Connecticut. The cyber-security expert has told authorities about his find and is currently waiting for officials to pick the machine up.Forensic tracing has shown that the machine was first purchased by an Ohio man at a Goodwill store in northern Michigan last month. The man purchased the machine for $8. Soon after, the machine wound up on eBay. It was selling for $1,200 on the website.  Harri Hursti, an election machine security expert, reportedly saw the listing and purchased it outright.“The fact that someone is selling voting machines on eBay, or on GovDeals, or any other site happens all the time,” Hursti said. “Most of the time, the seller is a government, a County, or an electronic recycling.”Authorities have instructed Hursti to leave the machine in the box it came in as they plan to swab the device for evidence. Hursti asserted that the theft of the machine raises questions regarding how the election machines are stored and guarded. Michigan law prevents citizens from holding, misusing or destroying voting machines. In addition, it prevents citizens from obtaining “undue possession” of the machines.","MINNEAPOLIS, MN – AUGUST 14: A sign reading “Vote Here” points toward a polling place for the 2018 Minnesota primary election at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church on August 14, 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:17 PM PT – Saturday, September 3, 2022California is advising residents not to charge their electric vehicles. This request comes just days after the State passed legislation to phase out gas powered cars by 2035.This week, the Golden State’s grid operator asked motorists not to charge their vehicles during peak hours citing the scorching heat and high energy consumption. 40 percent of Americans electric vehicles are registered in California. This statistic has led critics to ask how so much electricity usage would be nationally feasible. However, Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) said the answer to that question is more green energy investments.“We recognize that we needed to do more in terms of de-risking our transition to green energy,” Newsom said. “We are not doing anything except accelerating, I mentioned what we are doing on permitting and procurement, accelerating that transition to low carbon-renewable sources of energy.”Representative Steve Scalise (R-La.) took to Twitter. There, he referred to this request as the type of governance Democrats want nationwide.California is now telling people to “avoid using large appliances and charging electric vehicles” from 4-9pm.This from the same state that’s going to force everyone to buy electric cars by 2035.This is what Democrat control looks like—and they want it nationwide. What a joke. pic.twitter.com/8tS3KsQWqR— Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) August 31, 2022The State is currently getting scorched by a record-breaking heat-wave. It’s expected to be 10-to-20 degrees warmer than normal across the State throughout this Labor Day weekend, with temperatures reaching 115-degrees in the inland valleys and into the triple digits along the coast. The National Weather Service is calling it an extraordinary heat event. Although the sweltering temperatures will have residents cranking up air-conditioners, fans and swamp coolers, California is asking residents to set their thermostats to 78-degrees to cut back on energy usage.

Additionally, they became registered voters in the city of Naples in June of 2020.California had some of the strictest COVID-19 mandates in the Country. During the height of the pandemic a few of the policies that Newsom ordered included asking restaurants to do take-out only, ordering a statewide shelter in place, closing all parks and beaches and forcing the closure of churches. Newsom as well ordered businesses to close multiple times.This revelation comes after it was reported that Kenneth made a $5,000 donation to Newsom’s political rival Governor Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.). Newsom is a known critic of DeSantis and his policies. The California Governor recently pledged $100,000 to DeSantis’s Democratic rival Charlie Crist. Time to make Ron DeSantis a one-term governor.I'm pledging $100k right now to @CharlieCrist. Who will join me in helping Charlie become the next Governor of Florida? https://t.co/YvpkkGKkOb— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) August 25, 2022","ALAMEDA, CALIFORNIA – MARCH 16: California Gov.

Alex Wong / Getty ImagesOAN NewsroomUPDATED 4:25 PM PT – Friday, September 2, 2022Biden’s so-called ‘Battle for the Soul of the Nation’ speech on Thursday night is not getting the roaring applause he may have hoped for. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre was forced to defend the decision to have Marine Corps Officers stand in the background of Joe Biden’s divisive speech after the President caught heat from not only Conservatives but from left-wing media mainstays.A CNN reporter was one of many to point out that the military is meant to be kept apolitical. Brianna Keilar claimed that Biden standing in front of two Marines was disparaging to half the Country.Whatever you think of this speech the military is supposed to be apolitical. Positioning Marines in uniform behind President Biden for a political speech flies in the face of that. It’s wrong when Democrats do it. It’s wrong when Republicans do it.— Brianna Keilar (@brikeilarcnn) September 2, 2022 A guest on her show, an Iraq War veteran, also weighed in. Allison Jaslow said that though she may agree with sentiments in Biden’s speech, it’s hard to not see the Marine Officers as a prop.“Somebody made the decision to put those Marines in the shot,” Jaslow said. “The reality is those Marines didn’t have a choice whether to be there or not. They could be like myself, who if I was in the military still (I) would have agreed with the President and would’ve welcomed being at the event yesterday, but we don’t know if that’s true. The reality of it is that we need to make sure that our military is as removed from politics as possible.”The White House has dismissed any concerns. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre has claimed that Biden’s speech was not political.“The way we see it here, and I would argue the way many Americans across the country see it, is standing up for democracy is not political,” Jean Pierre said. “Defending rights and freedom is not political…We don’t call any of that political, we see that as leadership and we see that as Presidential.”The Press Secretary’s comments were contradictory to what the President said during his speech. “They fanned the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights to the pursuit of justice. To the rule of law, to the very soul of this country,” Biden said. “Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy. No, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love… Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.”Karine Jean Pierre went on to say that it’s not unusual to have Presidents deliver speeches in front of servicemembers. She cited Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.REAGAN 2/ pic.twitter.com/h0vAqvWgrb— Mueller, She Wrote (@MuellerSheWrote) September 2, 2022However, many of the examples being shared of these Presidents speaking with servicemembers on hand are not politically charged or motivated speeches but rather inaugural speeches or remarks that directly correlate to the military.",President Joe Biden delivers a prime-time speech at the Independence National Historical Park on Sept. 1 in Philadelphia.
