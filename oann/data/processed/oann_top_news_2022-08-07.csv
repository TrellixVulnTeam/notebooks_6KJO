2022-08-05,10:14 AM PT,"Biden says Americans need Inflation Reduction Act, economists disagree","The Biden administration has paired up with Big Business to promote its latest social spending bill. The President said a Democrat-backed spending binge will combat inflation, but hundreds of economists disagree.On Thursday, Joe Biden held a virtual conference with representatives of large businesses and labor unions to promote his so-called Inflation Reduction Act. He claimed the mega corporations had American families’ best interests at heart by putting their weight behind the bill. The Delaware native touted the multiple ways he alleged Americans will save money from health care to effects from the so-called climate crisis.“The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug prices, lowers health insurance premiums, invests in clean energy that will create jobs and economic opportunities for business and labor, reduces the deficit, and makes common sense reforms to our corporate tax code,” claimed the President. “These are the facts”.Biden praised the bill in tandem with the recently passed CHIPS Act, which the Democrat proclaimed would bolster clean energy investments and American manufacturing.“They see how already because of our work over the last 18 months, American manufacturing is coming back stronger than ever,” he stated. “Where is it written that America can’t lead the manufacturing in the world? Six-hundred, thirteen-thousand manufacturing jobs created just since I took office, the most created in three decade.”When we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, working families will get rebates to buy efficient appliances and weatherize their homes. And folks will have tax credits for efficient heating and cooling and rooftop solar.Families will see their energy bills drop by the hundreds.— President Biden (@POTUS) August 5, 2022However, analysts are less optimistic about the bill than Mr. Biden. Two-hundred, thirty economists penned a letter to House and Senate leadership warning the spending package will serve as gasoline for red hot inflation. The economists warned the spending tax hikes will serve as a one-two punch to the economy, boosting demand while handicapping supply.Furthermore, they asserted the suggested minimum corporate tax rate would suffocate a supply chain on life support, while medical price controls will stifle innovation. In a subsequent interview with Fox’s Larry Kudlow, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called the bill a “complete fraud” because it will fail to attack inflation, while serving as shrapnel to taxpayers and businesses.“That the subsidies to Obamacare include people $304,000 a year,” Graham noted. “That doesn’t sound like helping the poor and it also says the 15 percent minimum in tax that you described will create distance to build factories, buy equipment during a recession. Now who in the right mind wants to tax and spend during a recession?”Democrats, however, shot back at the bill’s skeptics by producing a letter signed by 126 economists in support of the spending binge. The bill’s ambitions were once thought to be extinguished until Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) came to an agreement on the measure with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) With Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) vocalizing her support for the legislation, it’s almost certain to pass through reconciliation.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:30 PM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022The world’s supply chains are continuing to fall short of the needs for countries that rely on foreign aid. In an interview with Associated Press on Thursday, an administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Samantha Power, gave her point of view as she deals with the global food crisis that has millions going hungry.“”Now we’re almost 20 million people who are going hungry and who are dependent on this emergency food assistance, but other donors are stretched pretty thin, other countries are stretched thin,” she stated.During a visit to the horn of Africa, Power saw just how affected these dependent countries have become. In Kenya, residents have had four consecutive years of drought, where there has not been enough rain to grow food crops and they are projected to have a fifth.“That’s never happened in recorded history to have four consecutive failed rainy seasons and so the livestock, often in famine conditions, that is who dies first,” explained Powers. “And then that ends up being something of a canary in the coal mine for humanity.”Today, I’m announcing a $106M partnership between @USAID and @WFP to provide food and nutrition assistance to nearly 914K crisis-affected people facing food insecurity and malnutrition, across South Sudan. https://t.co/URrecTx8tw— Samantha Power (@PowerUSAID) August 4, 2022Powers claims the shortage is the result of local conflicts and economic disruptions of the pandemic, all of which have been compounded by Russia invading Ukraine. This has deepened food shortages and raised prices as one top global grain producer made war on another.“All of the damage done up to this point by Russia has created such acute needs in Ukraine that the fixed sort of foreign assistance budgets or emergency assistance budgets just now have more claimants,” said Powers.USAID is continuing to monitor the global food crisis and will provide aid to countries that fall short in their own food production.","USAID Administrator Samantha Power is interviewed by the Associated Press, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, at USAID Headquarters in Washington.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) joined the Republicans effort to remove President Joe Biden’s federal environmental regulations.In a 51-to-47-vote, the Senate passed the Congressional Review Act with the intention of overturning a White House rule that was imposed in April. The rule required federal agencies to weigh climate and environmental impacts before issuing permits. The legislation was intended to speed up the processing of major projects.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R- W.Va.) asserted that the removal of the red tape would serve to revitalize an ailing US economy.“As we seek to improve our transportation… we claim our energy independence and build our domestic supply chains,” stated Sen. Capito. “Instead of making the environmental review process more efficient, the Biden administration has been doing everything in its power to make it much, much more difficult.”Fantastic to see @SenDanSullivan’s resolution to overturn @potus’ NEPA rule pass the Senate.

The US citizen was arrested roughly six months ago after being caught with vape cartridges containing cannabis oil at a Moscow airport. Griner was guilty on drug smuggling and possession charges.The two-time Olympic gold medalist pleaded with the judge for leniency ahead of the court’s decision in a last ditch effort to regain her freedom. Nonetheless, Russia officials have been keen it their belief that Griner violated Russian law and should be judged accordingly.“My parents taught me two important things,” she stated. “One: take ownership for your responsibilities. And two: work hard for everything that you have. That’s why I pled guilty to my charges. I understand everything that has been said against me, the charges that are against me, and that is why I pled guilty. But I had no intent to break any Russian laws. I made an honest mistake and I hope that, in your ruling, that it doesn’t end my life here.”Back home in the states, Griner had been prescribed medical marijuana for pain from chronic injuries. This is reportedly a common treatment for professional athletes on part of its mild side effects in comparison to most prescribed painkillers.Breaking: Brittney Griner was found guilty of drug possession and smuggling in a Russian court outside Moscow.

Kishida also announced Hiroshima will be hosting next year’s G7 summit where officials hope to rally world leaders behind a pledge of denuclearization.“Tens of thousands of people were killed in this city in the blink of an eye,” said UN head Antonio Guterres. “Women, children and men were incinerated in a hellish fire.”In Hiroshima to mark the 77th anniversary of the atomic bombing, I met young activists who tirelessly carry the message of peace forward to a new generation.The world must never forget what happened here. pic.twitter.com/2eQbQv8z0q— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) August 6, 2022Before dawn, survivors and their relatives began to gather at Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park to offer flowers and prayers. A silent prayer was held at 8.15 am, the moment the bomb was dropped. The Russian ambassador was not invited to the ceremony but visited Hiroshima on Thursday to lay flowers at the memorial site. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, President Vladimir Putin has made thinly veiled threats hinting at a willingness to deploy tactical nuclear weapons.In a speech on Saturday, Hiroshima mayor Kazumi Matsui cited Leo Tolstoy, the Russian author of “War and Peace” and said “Never build your happiness on the misfortune of others, for only in their happiness can you find your own.”Three days after the Hiroshima bombing, Washington dropped a plutonium bomb on the Japanese port city of Nagasaki, killing about 74,000 people and leading to the end of World War II. The United States remains the only country ever to have used nuclear weapons in conflict.The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was also in attendance and spoke alongside Kishida.","Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga (L) pays his respects during a ceremony to mark the 76th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bomb attack at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima on August 6, 2021. – Japan OUT (Photo by STR / JIJI PRESS / AFP) / Japan OUT (Photo by STR/JIJI PRESS/AFP via Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1234493426-e1628275217377.jpg, Ky.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed the decision on Friday, while claiming Pelosi’s visit was provocative. Chinese officials accused her of meddling in China’s internal affairs.In addition to targeting the House Speaker, China decided to halt cooperation with the US on several pressing issues, including transnational crime.This announcement comes as Biden administration officials said Pelosi’s trip was peaceful and claimed China’s military drills in response to the Speakers visit are extreme and unjustified. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken touched on the topic.“The United States has conveyed to the PCR consistently and repeatedly that we do not seek and will not provoke a crisis,” said Blinken. “(Taiwan) President Tsai said the same thing. China has chosen to overreact and use Speaker Pelosi’s visit as pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait.”I led a Congressional delegation to Taiwan to make crystal clear that America stands with the people of Taiwan – and all those committed to Democracy and human rights.Check out this video of our historic visit to Taipei. pic.twitter.com/TON6zB3x4s— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) August 3, 2022While speaking Friday during her ongoing trip, Pelosi asserted that the US will not allow China to isolate Taiwan or prevent other US lawmakers from visiting.","Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying gestures during a daily briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Beijing, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022.

(AP Photo/LM Otero)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:00 PM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban called out the progressive left at this years CPAC after he was welcomed to CPAC with a standing ovation. Speaking at the event on Thursday, Orban accused progressive liberals of trying to silence him and attempting to keep him away from the event.“They did not want me to be here and they made every effort to drive a wedge between us,” said Orban. “They hate me and slander me and my country as they hate you and slander you and the America you stand for. We all know how this works. Progressive liberals didn’t want me to be here because they knew what I would tell you. Because I’m here to tell you that we should unite our forces.”He then went on to suggest that today’s progressive left is equivalent to Nazi’s and communist dictators by trying to move the US away from Judeo-Christian values. Orban, who came to power in 2010, has increasingly clamped down on political opposition and press freedom, consolidating his power further over the last two elections.  During his speech, Orbán also attacked Jewish billionaire George Soros, former President Barack Obama, “globalists” and the Democratic Party. He went on to voice, “They hate me and slander me and my country, as they hate you.”“The horrors of Nazis and communism happened because some western states in continental Europe abandoned their Christian values,” he voiced. “Today’s progressives are planning to do the same. They want to give up on western values and create a new world, a post-western world. Who is going to stop them if we don’t?”🇭🇺🤝🇺🇸PM Orbán opens @CPAC calling for conservatives to unite forces & fight for a bright(er) future in the West. We should play by our own rules, protect our borders, families & children. Thank you @mschlapp @mercedesschlapp for having us! pic.twitter.com/wlUTLMCcIS— Balázs Orbán (@BalazsOrban_HU) August 4, 2022Orban concluded with a step by step guide for conservatives to fight in what he describes as an ongoing culture war.“We cannot fight successfully by liberal means,” the prime minister stated. “Because our opponents use liberal institutions, concept and language to disguise their Marxist and Hegemonic plans. Politics, my friend, are not enough. This war is a culture war. We have to revitalize. We have to revitalize our churches, our families, our universities and our community institutions.”A day before his appearance at CPAC, Orbán and his delegation met with former President Donald Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Szijjártó also commented in a tweet that Hungarian-US relations were “at their peak when Donald Trump was President” and expressed the hope that he’ll be president again. .45: Great spending time with my friend, Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Friday, August 5, 2022President Biden weighed in on the Brittney Griner case after the American basketball star was sentenced to nine years in a Russian jail on drug smuggling and possession charges. Speaking to the media from the White House Friday, Biden appeared optimistic about securing her release.“We call on President Biden and the United States government to redouble their efforts to do whatever is necessary and possible,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement.President Joe Biden released the following statement after a Russian court sentenced Brittney Griner to nine years in prison: pic.twitter.com/wxDCbaaQBe— ESPN (@espn) August 4, 2022The 31-year-old athlete was found guilty of bringing vape cartridges containing cannabis oil into Russia in February. Her sentencing could now pave the way for a prisoner swap between Griner and Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in Illinois. The result is a painful quandary for the Biden administration as it tries to maintain a hard line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over his war in Ukraine.“There’s nothing good here,” said Andrea Schneider, an expert on international conflict resolution at Cardozo School of Law. “No matter what Biden does, he’s going to be criticized. Either that we’re giving too much or we’re not working hard enough.”Brittney Griner being sentenced to 9 years in jail over cannabis is egregious.@POTUS must do everything in his power to get her back to the US.He also must correct that injustice here in America, too. Far too many people are locked up over non-violent drug offenses.— Nina Turner (@ninaturner) August 4, 2022Kremlin officials said that any potential deal could not proceed before her trial was complete, creating a glimmer of hope that the verdict might open the door for an exchange. But analysts called that unlikely anytime soon.“I don’t think this is going to get resolved quickly,” said Jared Genser, a human rights lawyer who represents Americans held by foreign governments. “I think the fact that Putin has not said yes right away means that he’s looked at the US offer and said, ‘Well, that’s their first offer. I can get more than that.’”That US offer first presented to Russia in June. They sought the release of Ms. Griner and Paul N. Whelan, a former Marine arrested in Moscow and convicted of espionage in 2020.","WNBA star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner is escorted from a court room ater a hearing, in Khimki just outside Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022.
