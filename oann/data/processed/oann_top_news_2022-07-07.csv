Yair Lapid shared his sentiments during a joint presser with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.The prime minister accused Iran of developing nuclear weapons even though the Islamic Republic denies this claim. Although Lapid praised Macron for pursuing a nuclear arrangement with Iran, he criticized the 2015 nuclear deal and the current negotiations with the rogue state as “insufficient.”“You were right then and you are even more right today,” stated Lapid. “The current situation cannot continue as it is. It will lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which would threaten world peace. We must all work together to stop that from happening.”פגישת עבודה עם נשיא צרפת, עמנואל מקרון🇮🇱🇫🇷@EmmanuelMacron pic.twitter.com/7j5hbMnUT9— יאיר לפיד – Yair Lapid (@yairlapid) July 5, 2022The US Envoy to Iran also recently raised concerns that the regime is fast approaching nuclearization.","French President Emmanuel Macron, right, and Israel’s Prime Minister Yair Lapid address journalists Tuesday, July 5, 2022 at the Elysee Palace in Paris.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:58 AM PT – Tuesday, July 5, 2022More Biden administration officials are coming out of the woodwork to challenge the legitimacy of the Supreme Court’s decision on Dobbs v. Jackson, in turn, continuing to stoke division between pro-life and pro-abortion Americans.Vice President Kamala Harris recently decried the ruling as “problematic on so many levels.” She went on to claim the case, which overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, took away a right given to women under the Constitution.However, critics of Roe and the justices in the majority argue Roe created the right to abortion and assert no author or amender of the Constitution discussed the issue of abortion.“For the first time in the history of our nation, took a constitutional right that had been recognized and took it from the women of America, took a constitutional right,” Harris stated. “And what is so outrageous about this on every level is one, it is the taking of a right that was given and guaranteed and something that we took for granted to be settled law.”The Vice President also contradicted her attacks on the high court when saying the conservative-majority Supreme Court is trying to govern women’s bodies. The Biden-Harris administration has come under immense scrutiny for their forced vaccination and masking policies, including a vaccine mandate for US troops and federal workers as well as a failed attempt to force the jab on airline travelers.“We also know that we’ve had a history in this country of government trying to claim ownership over human body,” Harris continued. “And we had supposedly evolved from that time and that way of thinking.”Additionally, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra vowed to fight the decision, while admitting the Supreme Court has the final say on the implications of the US Constitution. He said measures to protect abortion could include trafficking women across state lines to get abortions and pushing Congress to codify Roe. Becerra also implied the five justices who voted to overturn Roe went rogue just to make women suffer.Meanwhile, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas seemed to admit the attacks on the Supreme Court are working. He lamented there has been a heightened security threat since the Dobbs decision on Republican-appointed justices. This comes as far left activists have tried to organize protests outside the homes of the justices in question and are making threats against their lives.In the meantime, Republican lawmakers are calling on Democrats to stop their attacks on the judicial branch amid a risk of more violent protests. Even the Marshall of the Supreme Court is calling on the governor of Maryland to intervene to stop an attempted assassination of a justice. The DHS has also reported domestic extremists are likely to exploit the situation and cause more violence against officials who don’t conform to their agendas.","The U.S. Supreme Court is seen through a metal baracade on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 3, 2021.

Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) lamented that all civility is lost to Democrats when they don’t get their way.  During an interview over the weekend, she said Democrat tantrums include recent calls to change congressional rules to fit their agenda.The senator added, Democrats also threaten to defy the rules to enforce their demands. She mentioned the outcry over the recent Dobbs decision at the Supreme Court that has resulted in far-left activists calling for violent attacks on justices. Blackburn stressed when they don’t get their way, they usually take to the streets.“And what they would be doing is defying a Supreme Court decision and also they want to go around the Hyde Amendment, they want to go around Mexico City policy,” explained the lawmaker. “To them, it is imperative that they, the federal government, be able to control access to abortion. They do not want this to be sent to the states as the court has said. It is the jurisdiction of the states to set the regulation and restrictions around abortion, but for them that’s not good enough.”Blackburn suggested the left has chosen to weaponize the Dobbs decision “in their fearmongering campaign against the unborn.” However, she noted that move will help to create a culture that values life and empowers women.The Tennessee Republican also blamed Democrats for several failed policies that are devastating American communities, including President Joe Biden’s war on American energy and open border policies.Joe Biden should celebrate our nation’s independence by making us energy independent again.— Sen.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:47 AM PT – Wednesday, July 6, 2022The judge in the Illinois parade shooting case ordered the suspected gunman be held without bond as he faces seven first-degree murder charges. Robert Crimo III, 21, appeared in court Wednesday and officials said he admitted to his crimes, but they did not want to speculate on motives. He was charged with seven-counts of first degree murder.Police said the gunman opened fire from the rooftop of a high rise building just as the Fourth of July parade kicked off Monday morning in downtown Highland Park, which is located north of Chicago. While dozens of people were injured in the violent attack, six out of the seven victims have now been identified.“On a day that we came together to celebrate community and freedom we are instead mourning a tragic loss of life and struggling with the terror that was brought upon us,” voiced Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering.Authorities said the suspect intended to go to Madison, Wisconsin to commit another mass shooting. He reportedly bought four weapons in 2020 and purchased a Glock in 2021 after his 21st birthday. They believe Crimo pre-planned the attack on the parade and he was preparing for it for several weeks.The suspect was also said to be dressed in women’s clothing and investigators believe he did this to hide his identity and aid in his escape. He reportedly borrowed his mother’s vehicle. An alert was issued by authorities on the vehicle and Crimo’s information. The vehicle was later spotted and reported.“He brought a high-powered rifle to this parade, he accessed the roof of a business via a fire escape ladder and began opening fire on the innocent Independence Day celebration goers,” said Chris Covelli, spokesperson for the Major Crime Task Force at the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.A second rifle was located inside the vehicle with indications Crimo purchased this rifle as well. However, reports say he had legally purchased five weapons, including a shotgun and a pistol, prior to the attack. Additionally, authorities said Crimo purchased the rifle legally, despite having been involved in at least two police incidents in the past. He had a previous background of attempted suicide and threats of violence in 2019.In a video feed from the Lake County, Ill., jail Robert E.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:09 AM PT – Wednesday, July 6, 2022The White House appears to be dodging questions about a leaked voicemail from Hunter Biden’s laptop. During a press briefing on Tuesday, Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to answer a reporter’s question about the audio, while simply claiming it has yet to be verified.Prior to this, the White House refused to address the controversy surrounding Hunter’s overseas business dealings, which has led many to accuse him of benefiting from his father’s political influence.Karine Jean-Pierre has absolutely no answer for why Joe Biden left a voicemail for Hunter in 2018 saying he wanted to talk about the Biden family business dealings in China. pic.twitter.com/HutCyvZ1DI— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 5, 2022The voicemail in question came from Joe Biden in 2018 who discussed a New York Times article about his son’s foreign business affairs and suggested “he is in the clear.” This is in spite of the elder Biden claiming he was unaware of Hunter’s foreign affairs while running for president in 2020.﻿﻿﻿While Biden has yet to comment on his alleged involvement with his son’s affairs, additional audio from the laptop contains clips of Hunter admitting that his dad will do anything for him. Joe Biden actions seemed to confirm this as he confessed to allegedly getting a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Hunter’s business dealings fired.In the meantime, Republican Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said they will double down on their investigation into Hunter’s business affairs after this year’s midterm elections.Additionally, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, once again, demanding answers about Hunter Biden’s foreign affairs. He sent the letter Wednesday, pointing out that he had asked for information about Hunter’s foreign business dealings, his associates and family members back in May.Comer wrote, “it is troubling that the Biden administration is willing to provide a false story to the media to create the appearance of transparency while continuing to thwart congressional oversight.” This is the latest step by the House Oversight Committee member in investigating potential corruption within the Biden family and administration.","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Tuesday, July 5, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:35 PM PT – Wednesday, July 6, 2022The US State Department is not picking a side in the investigation into the death of Palestinian-American Al-Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. In a statement released on Monday, spokesperson Ned Price claimed after looking at the findings from Israeli and Palestinian Authority reports, the bullet that killed AbuAkleh likely came from a troop with the Israel Defense Forces. However, he stressed the killing was likely unintentional.In May, Abu Akleh was killed while covering an Israeli raid in the West bank, but Palestinian witnesses claim the raid was unwarranted and the death did not need to happen. However, ballistic experts say the bullet was badly shattered and could not be traced to an individual shooter.Additionally, Israeli officials said the raid was a part of a complex battle between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. They urged the public not to jump to any conclusions while the conclusion is still uncertain.“It is important to emphasize that during this operational event, like in many others, hundreds of bullets were fired at IDF (Israeli Defense Force) troops, which responded with firepower of their own, only in the direction of the sources of the shooting,” stated Benny Gantz, Israeli Defense Minister. “The first to bear responsibility in such events, are the terrorists who operate from within population centers.”Meanwhile, officials within the Palestinian Authority decried the State Department’s stance while arguing it weakens the Biden administration’s credibility as a beacon of freedom of press. Critics further claimed only Israeli troops fired shots during that raid and will seek an investigation by international organizations.“We will continue to call for justice and we will continue to call on the US to carry out a transparent investigation by an independent body,” said Lina Abu Akleh, niece of Shireen Abu Akleh. “In addition, we continue to call on the UN and the ICC to carry out an investigation and hold Israel accountable.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:22 AM PT – Wednesday, July 6, 2022California Governor Gavin Newsom signed off on a bill which could benefit human trafficking and prostitution in the state. Last week, the Democrat approved SB 357, which reverses loitering laws that law enforcement used to combat both.Some critics of the bill, which was authored by Democrat state Sen. Scott Weiner, contend it will hurt areas that already have poverty and a lot of crime. Additionally, sex trafficking victims argued the bill is hurting victims instead of providing help to survivors, while also increasing demand.“This is specifically talking about street walking and loitering for prostitution is public,” explained Jonathan Keller, President of the California Family Council. “This is going to effect poor communities, it’s going to effect black and brown communities more, but it’s going to actually harm them and make those places much less safe and much more hostile for families, for woman and girls.”It also received push back from California Senate Republican Scott Wilk who said the government should be doing everything it can to combat the crisis and not enable perpetrators. However, Newsom has claimed the legislation does not legalize prostitution and stressed it must be implemented “cautiously.”The measure will also allow those who were previously convicted or are serving sentences to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction. California is not only taking legislative action on prostitution, but also drug use. Last week, the California Assembly passed a bill to authorize drug injection sites in several cities.The assembly approved bill SB 57 last week, which allows cities, including Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco, to set up sites where opioid users could legally inject drugs in supervised settings. State Sen. Weiner, who authored the legislation, claimed safe consumption sites are a proven strategy to save lives and get people into treatment.The push to create injection sites comes amid a national opioid crisis and spike in overdose deaths. However, the legislation received push-back from Republicans who argue enabling illegal and destructive drug use will never work. The bill still needs to be passed by the state Senate before heading to Governor Newsom’s desk.","Assemblyman Jim Wood, D-Santa Rosa, left, calls on lawmakers to approve a measure carried by Assemblyman Matt Haney, D-San Francisco, right, to allow Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco, to set up places where opioid users could legally inject drugs in supervised settings, during the Assembly session in Sacramento, Calif., on Thursday, June 30, 2022.

(AP Photo/John Hanna)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:09 AM PT – Wednesday, July 6, 2022The attorney general of Kansas is running to unseat Democrat Governor Laura Kelly who is increasingly unpopular with Sunflower State voters. Challenger Derek Schmidt is advancing his gubernatorial campaign amid favorable polling for the Republican candidate.Schmidt’s message focuses on him being a Kansas native who aims “to bring common sense and conservative leadership to Kansas,” which resonates well with voters. The Republican attorney general said Kansas is where five generations of his family have learned the value of hard work as well as the importance of faith and family.“I believe in a bright Kansas future with a climate of opportunity that grows our state, and encourages our children to stay in Kansas and pursue their dreams,” Schmidt. “Where we proudly stand up for Bedrock constitutional principles like free speech, religious freedom, the rule of law, life and our Second Amendment.”Recent polls show Schmidt is leading Democrat Governor Laura Kelly by four-points. According to an internal GOP polling memo, 47 percent of Kansas voters support Schmidt while Governor Kelly has 43 percent support.Schmidt has received endorsements from both former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 45th President Donald Trump. They believe Schmidt is strong on crime, border security and the Second Amendment while also showing appreciation for the US military and veterans. Pompeo pointed out that he’s honored to support Schmidt for governor as he’s “always fought for the most vulnerable” and stands up for the right thing.Schmidt remains steadfast in his belief that Kansas was better-off under Trump’s America First leadership. He said he looks forward to bringing pro-America policies back to the Governor’s Office if elected. The Republican primary in Kansas takes place on August 2.","Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt discusses a proposal at a news conference, Tuesday, Feb. 23, 2021, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan.
