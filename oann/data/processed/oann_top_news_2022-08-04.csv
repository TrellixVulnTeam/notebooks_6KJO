DeVos suggested this idea must be a central tenet of the Republican party platform.According to the former Education Secretary, the bureaucracy does what it can to work against the interests of the people. She claimed the department was started in the 70s due to a corrupt political bargain. Since then, she feels it has only been used to increase the power of teachers‚Äô unions and other self-interested groups.‚ÄúI just think about the experience in the Department of Education and how formidable the bureaucracy is,‚Äù explained DeVos. ‚ÄúAnd how difficult it is to advance policy in an environment where the vast majority of the individuals are actually working against you.‚Äù¬†DeVos went on to say that she wants to see education policy returned to the United States.","WASHINGTON, DC ‚Äì MARCH 28: U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos testifies during a Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee discussing proposed budget estimates and justification for FY2020 for the Education Department on March 28, 2019 in Washington, DC.

(AP Photo/Mazhar Ali Khan, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:32 AM PT ‚Äì Tuesday, August 2, 2022The White House announced the death of a prominent figure in Al-Qaeda. President Joe Biden confimred the successful killing of terrorist leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri. In a Monday press conference, the President said Zawahiri was killed by a drone strike over the weekend in the Afghan capitol of Kabul.‚ÄúAfter relentlessly seeking Zawahri for years under Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump, our Intelligence Community located Zawahri earlier this year,‚Äù Biden stated. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. After carefully considering clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This mission was carefully planned, rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians.‚ÄùZawahiri played a prominent role in the organization by acting as Osama Bin Laden‚Äôs second-in-command before taking over as their leader after the death of Bin Laden in 2011. He was also reportedly involved in the planning of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center as well as bombings at two US embassies in Africa that claimed the lives of 224 people.‚ÄúHe was deeply involved in the planning of 9/11,‚Äù said Biden. ‚ÄúOne of the most responsible for the attacks and murdered 2,977 people on American soil. For decades, he was the mastermind behind attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more. He played a key role in the bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others.‚ÄùBiden then went on to say that he will be continuing to address threats from the organization despite the death of Zawahiri.‚ÄúMy administration will continue to vigilantly monitor and address threats from Al-Qaeda, no matter where they emanate from,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúAs Commander-in-Chief, it is my solemn responsibility to make America safe in a dangerous world. The United States did not seek this war against terror. It came to us. We answered with the same principles of resolve that have shaped us for generation upon generation, to protect the innocent, defend liberty and we keep the light of freedom burning a beacon for the rest of the entire world.‚ÄùToday, and every day, I am grateful to the superb patriots who serve in the United States intelligence and counterterrorism community.It is thanks to their extraordinary persistence and skill that this operation was a success ‚Äì they have made us all safer. pic.twitter.com/OUARNt1Kdv‚Äî President Biden (@POTUS) August 2, 2022The operation marked the first publicly announced CIA strike in Afghanistan since¬† Biden‚Äôs botched withdrawal of US forces last year. Zawahiri‚Äôs death comes as a heavy blow to international terrorism and it may reduce competition between the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the Afghan powerplay.Senior Taliban figures were reportedly aware of Zawahiri‚Äôs presence in the area. They even took steps to conceal his presence after Saturday‚Äôs successful strike by restricting access to the safe house and rapidly relocating members of his family, including his daughter and her children who were intentionally not targeted during the strike and remained unharmed. The US did not alert Taliban officials ahead of Saturday‚Äôs strike.","FILE ‚Äì In this 1998 file photo made available on March 19, 2004, Ayman al-Zawahri poses for a photograph in Khost, Afghanistan.

Wade was overturned in June, Kansas citizens will have their opportunity to make it known how they feel about abortion. On Tuesday, the people of Kansas will vote on the Value them Both Amendment. If the amendment is passed, it would declare there is no right to an abortion in the state while also allowing the state legislature to write laws on the issue.Following a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling, abortion became a constitutional right under the state constitution. Legislators can only legislate on the issue if the state ‚Äúhas a compelling and narrow interest‚Äù in the regulation. This has meant the furthest the state has been able to go in banning the procedure is a 22-week gestation limit and a 24-hour waiting period.POLLS ARE OPEN ACROSS KANSAS! Today is the day.

Find your polling location here >> https://t.co/kACq4xSb2u pic.twitter.com/RG0xeJHled‚Äî Value Them Both (@ValueThemBoth) August 2, 2022According to pro-life activists, the ruling as it currently exists will open the door for unlimited abortion and the repeal of existing restrictions.‚ÄúSo in 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court basically cleared the path to unlimited abortion in our state‚Äôs constitution by discovering a nearly unlimited right to abortion,‚Äù said Peter Northcott, Executive Director of Kansans for Life. ‚ÄúSo now, every single one of our pro life laws, from parental notifications to our bans on taxpayer funded abortions are now in danger of being struck down.‚ÄùPro-abortion activist and former Governor Kathleen Sebelius (D- Kan.) claimed state Republicans structured the referendum to be confusing and set it for a primary because they know Democrats are less likely to turn out.‚ÄúThe amendment is very confusing,‚Äù explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs written in a very convoluted way and it takes a lot of explanation. And the legislature specifically chose what they thought would be the very lowest turnout election possible.‚ÄùOn the ground activists have confidence that ‚Äòno‚Äô will prevail more than Democrat politicians. One activist from the ‚Äòno‚Äô side, Jessica Roland, believes that most Americans support abortion access and the referendum will prove that it doesn‚Äôt stop at the Kansas border.‚ÄúThe majority of Americans do feel that abortion should be legal, so we‚Äôve gotta get you out there and we‚Äôve gotta get your voice heard,‚Äù she asserted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to build a community, and change some hearts and minds if we can.‚ÄùPolling has been scant. Based off a poll that was taken a few weeks ago, however, it‚Äôs expected that it could be a tight race for the amendment. Forty-seven percent of potential voters said they‚Äôd vote yes and 43 percent said they‚Äôd vote ‚Äòno.‚Äô The remaining 10 percent in the balance is undecided. Early voter turnout has also reportedly shattered expectations. The pro-choice side sees that as an indication that the amendment will go down in defeat.We FEEL the energy heading into Election Day! üî•Our grassroots team and @sbaprolife student canvassers rallied this morning before heading out to meet Kansans to encourage them to vote YES on #ValueThemBoth! pic.twitter.com/7VDwI5PDpn‚Äî Value Them Both (@ValueThemBoth) July 30, 2022Despite the headwinds and high court rulings, pro-life Kansans are confident that on Tuesday, Kansas will become the first state to value both the mother and her baby in the womb through referendum.","FILE ‚Äì In this photo from Friday, July 8, 2022, a sign in a yard in Olathe, Kansas, promotes a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to allow legislators to further restrict or ban abortion.

(Taiwan Presidential Office via AP)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Cali.) met with Taiwanese leadership amid increasing tensions with Communist China. On Wednesday, she held a joint press conference with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in a show of solidarity between their two countries. The House Speaker outlined the purpose for her highly contested visit.‚ÄúOn our visits as Congressional delegations, we have three purposes,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúOne is security. Security for our people, global security. Two is economics to spread as much prosperity as possible And three is governance.‚ÄùPelosi‚Äôs visit follows increased Chinese military drills in the South China Sea near Taiwan. The People‚Äôs Republic view Taiwan as a de facto part of the Chinese Mainland and has asserted Pelosi‚Äôs recognition of the island as an independent nation-state is a violation of China‚Äôs sovereignty. However, Pelosi has claimed the situation is representative of a broader global struggle between democracy and totalitarianism. She expressed that the US is backing Taiwan.‚ÄúThat in the Congress, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans are committed to the security of Taiwan in order to have Taiwan be able to most effectively defend themselves,‚Äù Pelosi stated. ‚ÄúBut it also is about our shared values of democracy and freedom, and how Taiwan has been an example to the world in that regard.‚ÄùOur delegation had the distinct privilege of meeting with the President of Taiwan @Iingwen today.We discussed how America & Taiwan can deepen our economic ties, further strengthen our security partnership & defend our shared democratic values. pic.twitter.com/VL509UYK4x‚Äî Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) August 3, 2022President Tsai raised concerns that in light of the Ukraine crisis, a Chinese incursion into Taiwan could be next. Pelosi asserted that if the island falls, more free societies will fall under the boot of the CCP..‚ÄúThat has evolved to a stronger place now and offers a very strong contrast to what‚Äôs happening on mainland China,‚Äù she noted. ‚ÄúNo more evidence needed than what happened in Hong Kong. Under one country, two systems, it didn‚Äôt happen.‚ÄùPelosi is the highest ranking US official to visit the island of Taiwan in 25 years.","In this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left, and Taiwanese President President Tsai Ing-wen wave during a meeting in Taipei, Taiwan, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022.

The Secretary stated that upholding the values of the NPT resulted in Ukraine giving up its nuclear arms in 1994. He claimed those values could have long lasting implications for smaller countries facing threats from bigger adversaries.Additionally, Blinken urged nuclear powers to wield their power and responsibility.

A few of the ideas she mentioned included building a underground water storage in Kern County, California as well as improving the power grid in Austin, Texas. It also included the idea of creating projects to help protect neighborhoods at risk of flooding in Miami, Florida.The Vice President could not hide her elation that the funding is double the amount compared to the money that was spent on the same endeavors last year. The Biden Administration intends to double the sum of the spending project each year. While Harris was speaking, she also bemoaned the inequity wrought by so-called climate change and called for ‚Äúenvironmental justice.‚Äù‚ÄúThe climate crisis has exposed and intensified generations of economic and environmental inequities that have been present in communities across our nation,‚Äù the Vice President explained. ¬†‚ÄúAnd our administration remains committed to addressing those inequities through environmental justice‚Äù.The Democrat went on to regale the audience on the Biden Administration‚Äôs vision for a so-called clean energy future.

He has argued that cheap energy is one of the greatest benefits to the poor, while expensive fuel keeps them entrenched in their economic state.Whatever makes energy cheaper is if primary benefit to the poor.
