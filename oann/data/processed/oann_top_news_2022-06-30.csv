10:37 AM PT",Sen. McConnell: We will be very picky with Biden appointments,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave the US Supreme Court an ‘A’ grade in effectiveness and the Biden administration an ‘F’ for far-left.  While speaking at a rotary club in Florence, Kentucky on Monday, he praised recent decisions in the Supreme Court that bolstered the Second Amendment and stripped federal protections created by Roe v. Wade. McConnell claimed the Dobbs decision on abortion was the correct decision because it takes away the power to legislate the issue from a deeply divided Congress.“In the Senate, most things require 60 votes, not just 51,” he noted. “Neither side of this issue has come anywhere close to having 60 votes, so I think this is likely to all be litigated out in the various states around the country through the democratic process.”Meanwhile, McConnell stressed President Joe Biden has turned the executive branch into a far left playground. He pointed out Biden has never been a moderate, but claimed to be because he was running against Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) for the Democrat presidential nomination.Since taking office, McConnell said Biden has shown his true colors. The GOP lawmaker vowed to stop him from further tilting America to the left when Republicans take back the Senate.“So, if I’m majority leader, we’ll be really picky on appointments,” said McConnell. “There’s 12,000 executive branch appointments that come to us. They’re not all as important as the Supreme Court, but many of them are quite important. They have to be confirmed by the Senate.”McConnell went on to say there’s still a chance for Biden to come back to the center if the predicted red wave crashes down in November. He then pointed out, Bill Clinton pulled back his sweeping agenda after the 1994 mid-term elections.In the meantime, McConnell asserted he will continue trying to center the Biden administration. Additionally, the Senate Minority Leader said he will compromise with Democrats on several issues like he did with raising the debt ceiling, infrastructure and gun control. However, he said the fate of America is up to the American people who will be giving Biden his ultimate midterm report card this November.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022.

Officials said there was no working AC or signs of water in the truck. Republicans have called this tragedy another example of President Joe Biden’s open border policies with no deterrence in the US immigration system.Horrified at the tragic loss of life near San Antonio. This speaks to the desperation of migrants who would put their lives in the hands of callous human smugglers who show no regard for human life.

It was a refrigerated tractor-trailer, but there was no visible working AC unit on that rig.”San Antonio Mayor, Ron Nirenberg lamented at the human toll accumulated by traffickers taking advantage of people in need.“So I would urge you all to think compassionately and pray for the deceased, the ailing, the families,” he noted. “And we hope that those responsible for putting these people in such inhumane conditions are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”San Antonio Police Chief, William McManus said three individuals were taken into custody in connection to the incident, but it’s currently unknown whether the suspects were directly involved in human trafficking. An investigation into the matter is currently being spearheaded by the US Homeland Security Investigations.This administration continues to blatantly lie to the American people that the border is ""closed,"" ""effectively managed,"" and that they have ""operational control"" of it.

Rather than outlawing abortion, the House Minority Leader said the ruling allows citizens to decide the issue on a state-by-state basis.“Democrats aren’t just for abortion, every single one in Congress voted to have abortion up to the moment of birth,” he noted. “America does not support that. So now what most people would want (is) to have their own opinion, be able to have input in it, within each state and that’s what will go forward.”""Today's Supreme Court decision in Dobbs is the most important pro-life ruling in American history…The right to life has been vindicated.

(AP Photo/Michael Sohn)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:00 PM PT – Monday, June 27, 2022Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin has not accomplished the goals of his invasion. During an interview Sunday, Blinken said Putin’s goal was to erase Ukraine sovereignty and independence from the map. However, the US official asserted that Putin has already failed.“Let’s not confuse the tactical with strategic,” Blinken said. “When it comes to Putin’s strategic objectives, it’s not working.”Russia’s initial attempt at a surprise attack to seize Kyiv and other areas of Ukraine did not go as planned. In recent weeks, it’s forces have seized cities in Ukraine’s east, including Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk. The adjacent city of Lysychansk is now under intense attack.“We have seen sporadically,” he voiced. “Ever since Putin lost the battle for Kyiv and had to shift his focus just to Eastern and Southern Ukraine, they have occasionally launched missiles at a distance basically to terrorize people.”Blinken’s remarks come out of Germany where G7 leaders announced a ban on new imports of Russian gold. This comes as the ruble has hit its highest level in seven years, but Blinken affirmed Russians are bearing the brunt of economic sanctions. According to the latest report by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34,530 Russian servicemen have died since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian forces have also destroyed 1,507 Russian tanks, 3,637 combat armoured vehicles, 759 artillery systems, 241 multiple rocket launcher systems, 99 air defense systems, 216 warplanes and 183 helicopters.“Even if Russia succeeds in capturing more territory, he will inherit cities and towns that his own artillery have turned to rubble and the local population that hates him,” he expressed.The world is horrified by Russia’s missile strike today, which hit a crowded Ukrainian shopping mall — the latest in a string of atrocities. We will continue to support our Ukrainian partners and hold Russia, including those responsible for atrocities, to account.— Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) June 27, 2022Blinken said that Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Putin is on the scene.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22175579892182.jpg, More Than 1M Voters Leave Democrat Party For GOP As Biden’s Approval Numbers Continue To SinkTOPICS:Antony BlinkenG-7GermanyGOLDnewsOANOANNPresident Vladimir PutinRussiaUkraineWar SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/blinken-standard-of-living-for-russians-is-dropping/

The legislation passed Monday along party lines. It would provide refuge for trans youth and their parents, along with physicians who believe in so-called gender-affirming health care.Two people gave testimonies in opposition of the bill. One included a 17-year-old girl who shared how much she regretted removing both of her breasts when she decided to medically transition at 13. Another testimony was from a lawyer and mother, Erin Friday, who said the bill is unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. She also laid out what the bill actually is.Erin Friday, a courageous Mom and a California Attorney, testified again today in Sacramento against S.B. 107 on so-called ""Gender-affirming health care"" introduced by Scott Wiener.Erin absolutely shut down the deceptive rhetoric and exposed the truth of this harmful bill. pic.twitter.com/TrVlIP6Fjn— Kelly S.

(Photo by Hector Vivas/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:32 PM PT – Tuesday, June 28, 2022Mexico’s president slammed the Biden administration’s border policies after at least 50 migrants were found dead in texas in an alleged human trafficking incident. On Tuesday, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the US-Mexico border is “out of control.”He further lamented 22 of the deceased were Mexican nationals while seven were reportedly from Guatemala and two from Honduras. Lopez Obrador claimed the surge of migrants going into the US is a result of poor economic policies affecting Central and South America as well as the entrepreneurship of human smugglers.“These unfortunate events have to do with the situation of poverty and desperation of our Central American and Mexican brothers and sisters,” stated the Mexican President. “It happens because there is also human trafficking and lack of controls at the border between Mexico and the United States and inside the United States.”And yet the US keep sending migrants to wait inside Mexico where they are easy prey to organized crime. https://t.co/7pu3X5ClyM— José Luis Granados Ceja (@GranadosCeja) June 28, 2022Lopez Obrador said he will meet with President Biden on July 12 to discuss migration. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are speaking out regarding the left’s open border approach to immigration.Specifically, Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) blamed Biden’s border policies, or lack there of, for the dozens of migrant deaths that took place in the Lone Star State. In a tweet Monday, Abbott said the deaths occurred due to Biden’s refusal to enforce the law.At Least 42 People Found Dead Inside Truck Carrying Migrants In Texas. These deaths are on Biden.They are a result of his deadly open border policies.They show the deadly consequences of his refusal to enforce the law. https://t.co/8KG3iAwlEk— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) June 28, 2022His criticism comes as the death toll has risen to at least 50 people after a large group of migrants was discovered Monday in an abandoned 18-wheeler. The migrants were coming from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. Authorities said there weren’t any signs of a working air conditioner or water and are unsure how long the migrants were stuck for.Record numbers of migrants have crossed the southern border under Biden’s watch and Border Patrol carried out more than 222,000 apprehensions in May alone.","Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, President of Mexico,  gestures during a state visit to Mexico at Palacio Nacional on October 17, 2019 in Mexico City, Mexico.
