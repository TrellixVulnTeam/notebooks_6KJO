8:21 AM PT",Top military official warns Iran ‘weeks’ from nuclear weapon,"Top military officials expect further aggression from Iran funded militias in the Middle East as the country gets closer than ever to nuclear capabilities. US Air Force Lt. Gen. Alexis Grynkewich raised concerns over Iran’s expanding nuclear capabilities Thursday during a change of command ceremony.Recent reports out of Tehran point to the nation stockpiling nuclear fuel and establishing advanced technology previously prohibited under the now abandoned Iran Nuclear Deal.“If Iran were to get a nuclear weapon, I think it would be a very destabilizing thing for the entire region,” stated Lt. Grynkewich. “We’re obviously watching that very closely and will be ready for whatever the outcome is.”This news comes as President Joe Biden concludes his tour of the Middle East, where he lobbied for oil rich nations to aid the US in its ongoing energy shortage. Biden’s administration has expressed interest in reviving the Iran Nuclear Deal after the US withdrew from the deal in 2018.Putin's visit to Iran today should tell you all you need to know. The new Axis of Evil is scheming against the U.S. and our allies because President Biden has given them the runway they need. We cannot continue to sit back and watch it happen.— Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) July 19, 2022Meanwhile, John Bolton, former Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (NSA), suggested “US counter-proliferation will need to be more extensive, with tougher sanctions and assistance, to opposition groups to overthrow the Ayatollahs. The former official also said there are only two ways to stop Iran: get a new regime that doesn’t want to build nuclear weapons or destroy the program.",An Iranian flag waves at the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.

Mayor Ted Wheeler unveils plan to combatMayor Ted Wheeler makes an announcement of a new initiative to combat surging gun violence in Oregon’s largest city on Thursday, July 21, 2022, in Portland, Ore. (AP Photo/Claire Rush)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:45 PM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022Rising gun-related homicides in Portland, Oregon have spurred a response from Mayor Ted Wheeler (D). Wheeler announced a new initiative to combat rising homicides in the city. During a Thursday press conference, he unveiled the safer summer PDX 2022 which will allocate $2.4 million to helping the local government along with several non-profit organizations in establishing community-focused intervention programs and improve response times to shootings.Additionally, he said it will re-prioritize work within city bureaus to quell shootings, such as identifying areas where they are the most prevalent and modifying the traffic flow to the area or increasing the lighting. Prior to this, the Democrat mayor cut a significant amount of funds from the city’s police in response to mounting pressure from anti-police activists in the wake of George Floyd’s death.“Today, I’m presenting a two year evidence based plan called safer summer PDX,” said Wheeler. “This plan is specific and it provides actionable goals to better coordinate existing resources and activates an additional $2.4 million to near-term community based violence interventions.”Wheeler then went on to outline what he expects his plan will do about the city’s homicide rate.“Safer summer PDX is accompanied by an emergency declaration that will implement the plan in an agile, accountable, coordinated and fairer manner, reducing Portland’s gun violence by at least 10 percent over the next two years,” he stated.STATE OF EMERGENCY: Mayor Ted Wheeler's message directly to those involved in Portland's gun violence crisis:""We do not choose the lives that we are born into… We are sincere in wanting to offer you a path out."" pic.twitter.com/bu9xA4Eaq5— Wesleigh Ogle KATU (@WesleighOgle) July 22, 2022This comes as Portland experienced a 241 percent increase in non-fatal shootings over the past two years with another study saying the city saw a 144 percent increase in gun-related murders between 2019 and 2021, but Wheeler is promising to bring peace back to the city.“Until Portland’s gun murders stop, we won’t stop,” he voiced. “We won’t stop until we get justice for more gun violence victims and their families. We won’t stop until we bring peace back to those Portland neighborhoods that are too often caught in the crossfire.”Wheeler said that because Portland has a decentralized governmental structure, the plan will bring all agencies that can address gun violence together.","Mayor Ted Wheeler makes an announcement of a new initiative to combat surging gun violence in Oregon’s largest city on Thursday, July 21, 2022, in Portland, Ore.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:30 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022Former First Lady Melania Trump responded to allegations that she did not condemn clashes during January 6 protests. Melania said on Thursday that she was taking archival photographs of the White House renovations on January 6, 2021 with a team of photographers she commissioned months prior.She added that she was unaware of events at the Capitol Building because she was fulfilling the duties of the First Lady. This comes after her former Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham claimed the First Lady did not immediately sign off on a statement condemning the Capitol protest.“As with all First Ladies who preceded me, it was my obligation to record the contents of the White House’s historic rooms, including taking archival photographs of all the renovations,” Trump said. “Several months in advance I organized a qualified team of photographers, archivists and designers to work with me in the White House to ensure perfect execution. As required, we scheduled January 6, 2021 to complete the work on behalf of our Nation.” It was not until January 11, five days after the insurrection, that Trump in part condemned the violence. According to Grisham, she sent Trump a text that said “Do you want to tweet that peaceful protests are the right of every American, but there is no place for lawlessness and violence?” Trump replied with “No.”“Knowing her as well as I did at that point it was so unlike her to not have condemned it,” Grisham voiced. “That was the moment it all kind of broke me. Yesterday, hearing Cassidy’s testimony I felt compelled to show that text because it was a lot of context I thought and again knowing Melania like I did I was so disappointed and discouraged and sickened that she wouldn’t stand up and just say simply, ‘There should be no violence.’”Melania Trump blames her former chief of staff @OMGrisham for not keeping her up to date.Here’s the text that Grisham sent to her that day. pic.twitter.com/Cxo7QYWFll— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) July 21, 2022Grisham was a loyal Trump deputy for more than five years.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:07 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022New York City Mayor Eric Adams said migrants are becoming a “real burden” for the Big Apple. This week, Adams pleaded with the White House to provide aid to help accommodate the more than 2,800 people who recently entered the city’s shelter system.“This is a real burden on New Yorkers as we’re trying to do the right thing,” Adams said. “We already have an overburdened shelter system. So now we’re talking about food, clothing, school. This is going to impact our schools because we do not turn away individuals because they are undocumented. Translation services. There is just a whole host of things that this is going to produce. We need help.”Adams was quick to blame migrants sent by Texas and Arizona, but also acknowledged federal migrant flights have contributed to the total sum. The mayor listed a number of services for migrants he would like to be financed by federal tax dollars.“Currently, New York City is experiencing a marked increase in the number of asylum seekers who are arriving from Latin America and other regions,” he voiced. “In some instances, families are arriving on buses sent by the Texas and Arizona governments, while in other cases it appears that individuals are being sent by the federal government.”Adams asserted that asylum seekers have protected status and that while they’re residing in New York City his administration has the obligation to provide them resources.“If we do not get these urgently needed resources we may struggle to provide the proper level of support our clients deserve, while also facing challenges as we serve both a rapidly growing shelter population and new clients who are seeking asylum,” he stated. “We are calling on the federal government to partner with New York City as we help asylum seekers navigate this process and to provide financial and technical resources.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams: Influx of illegal aliens is “a real burden” on NYC resources. pic.twitter.com/5hc7x5YzQr— Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) July 20, 2022American border towns are familiar with New York’s plight as more than three million migrants have surged into the country since Joe Biden took office.","FILE – Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden, on July 1, 2022, in New York.

McConnell: Biden prefers dirty fuel from dictators over American energySenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, July 19, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:57 AM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022According to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), outrageous fuel prices are an argument against so-called green energy rather than a reason to transition to it. On Wednesday, the Republican stalwart decried Democrats for for domestic oil producers and exporters up to 60 percent. However, while Democrats are hindering American energy, McConnell claimed the only relief they have proposed to the American people has been made in China.“If you are not among the 75 percent of American who say inflation has caused you financial hardship and you happen to have a spare $80,000 laying around, Washington Democrats want to give you a green energy tax credit,” explained the Republican lawmaker. “If you buy an electric vehicle, maybe with Chinese supply chains. This is what Washington Democrats are trying to do with their one party government.”McConnell harkened back to the words of 2020 presidential candidate Biden who had promised to end fossil fuels. The Republican lamented Biden made good on those promises, promptly waging war on American oil, coal and jobs in the name of his climate crusade. Without an alternative fuel source already in place and Americans reeling from the White House’s separation from gas, McConnell noted that Biden has, indeed, sought to increase oil supply from other countries.McConnell struggled to find the green energy efficacy in Biden’s actions as the US producers extract oil and gas at a far more environmentally friendly way than foreign competitors. Furthermore, the Republican noted the countries the Biden administration is begging for oil from are morally abhorrent to American sensibilities. Despite these negatives, McConnell declared the real loser in this situation to be American people.“If the Biden administration really is serious about helping American consumers then they’ll stop waging war on American producers,” he stated. “If they are serious, they will call off Democrats’ plan to tax reliable American energy and to extension. For the sake of working familiar who are struggling to fill their gas tanks and lights on, I hope they get serious.”﻿Some of the Biden climate initiatives have faced road blocks as his $300 billion green tax credit failed in the Senate and the Supreme Court ruled the EPA could not impose an anti-carbon tax on American businesses. As inflation fears gridlock the Senate on large spending packages, Biden is reportedly considering declaring climate change a national emergency in order to steamroll democracy.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, July 19, 2022.

(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:13 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US needs to do a better job in approving arms sales to Taiwan. Esper made the remark on Thursday in Taiwan after recently meeting with Taiwan’s president and also said he would relay the island’s concern to Washington D.C. Taiwan has expressed frustration over the speed of weapons deliveries as China has ramped up military pressure on the island. Some of the weapons on Taiwan’s wish list are javelin-anti tank missiles and stinger anti-aircraft missiles.The missiles are in great demand in Ukraine where they have been keeping Russian aircraft at bay, but US supplies have shrunk and producing more of the anti-aircraft weapons has faced significant hurdles due to limited manufacturing capacity.Esper visited Taiwan under the auspices of the Atlantic Council think-tank where he had meetings with senior leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen. He said he did not get the sense Taiwanese officials were frustrated at what arms were on offer from Washington.“I didn’t pick up any frustration other than the speed at which we conduct arms sales,” he said.Great meetings yesterday in Taipei. Looking forward to today’s sessions with President Tsai, Defense Minister Chiu, and Foreign Minister Wu on how to strengthen US-Taiwan relations and readiness in face of growing PRC threats to our shared interests and free & open Indo-Pacific. https://t.co/bFrLpc9SRW— Dr. Mark T. Esper (@MarkTEsper) July 18, 2022The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but has also been prodding the government to focus more on asymmetric warfare. This is where a smaller force employs unconventional tactics against a larger enemy using more mobile weapons to make the island harder to attack, something Tsai has said she is prioritizing. Esper said Taiwan was never going to be able to match China in terms of conventional power and Taiwan should be studying how Ukraine has fought Russia using asymmetric strategies.Shortly after NATO officially named China an enemy target, its in-house think tank (Atlantic Council) just sent a delegation to Taiwan including former Defense Sec.

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) took his former colleague to task on Tuesday when he asked Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) about his current work as a lobbyist for Disney. The hearing focused on the consequences of corporations tracking and selling user data to governments or law enforcement. Gaetz said he was worried about private entities trying to “program” people and “make them think a certain way” by harmfully utilizing people’s data.“Like particularly with the Walt Disney corporation that it is in business with the Chinese Communist Party,” Gaetz said.Goodlatte said he did not know about the accusations Gaetz leveled and that he couldn’t comment on them. Gaetz went on to bring up a conversation that the pair had as members in the Capitol Hill Club, D.C.’s prime private hang-out spot for Republican lawmakers.“Chairman Goodlatte, do you remember a conversation you and I had?” Gaetz questioned. “When you led this committee at the Capitol Hill Club where you said, ‘The best way to be successful in the Judiciary Committee is to find interest groups that are opposed to one another and to tell both of them that you’ll support their positions, so they’ll both make donations?’”A man once said, “The best way to be successful in the Judiciary Committee is to find interest groups opposed to one another and tell them both you'll support their position so they'll both make donations.”That man was former GOP Chairman turned Disney lobbyist Bob Goodlatte 👇 pic.twitter.com/nyldqtgHhH— Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) July 20, 2022A class-action lawsuit was filed against The Walt Disney Company on Thursday, April 3 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit alleges that the embedded technology, known as “software development kits” were collecting data on children in secret to facilitate behavioral advertising or marketing analysis.“As a company long-engaged in the practice of engaging and profiting from children, Disney needs to make sure its games and apps comply with the law,” voiced Michael Sobol, an attorney filing on behalf of the plaintiffs. “They and the companies they work with always have to obtain verifiable parental consent before extracting kids data from their mobile devices when kids play Disney’s mobile apps.”Disney came under fire for violating the privacy of children and tracking their activities on Disney apps with the intent to sell the information. They are on a mission to use big data and machine learning to optimize their guests experience. The data industry that tracks and sells information on online activities will be worth $270 billion by 2026.","WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 09: Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) arrives for a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing with members of the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee on Capitol Hill on December 9, 2020 in Washington, DC.

During a virtual meeting with his economic team Friday, Biden said gas prices have fallen every day this summer for a consecutive 38 days. The average price at the pump topped $5 nationwide in June and according to Biden gas is just under $4 in over 35 states. He said the US is producing 12 million barrels of oil a day and is on track to near record highs, but claimed prices of oil and gas aren’t coming down fast enough.Tune in as I meet virtually with my economic team on how gas prices are coming down for American families. https://t.co/ogpWg6fsJb— President Biden (@POTUS) July 22, 2022“I’ve been working to make sure that when the price of oil comes down, the price at the pump comes down as well and comes down in real time,” Biden said during the meeting. “The good news is that’s happening, but it’s not happening fast enough. We’ve made progress, but prices are still too high.”Biden said his administration will be looking at ways to increase oil production from existing wells and permits. He called on the US oil industry to do its part as well.“My message to these companies is use the permits or lose them,” he voiced. “Secondly, I’m telling the industry: you’re making record profits due to Putin’s war in Ukraine. Use those profits to increase production and refining. Don’t use those profits to buy back your stocks and dividends.”Biden said while he plans to continue his efforts to keep gas prices falling in the US, the longer term answer is a “clean energy economy” that focuses on renewable energy and more affordable electric vehicles.Biden affirmed his administration will continue working on ways to increase oil production from existing wells and permits.","The price of regular unleaded gas is advertised for just under $4 a gallon at a Woodman’s, Wednesday, July 20, 2022, in Menomonie Falls, Wis.

Thank you very much.” — Steve BannonFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon reaffirmed his innocence on charges of ignoring a subpoena issued by the January 6 Committee. Attorneys representing Bannon concluded his defense on Thursday and made a motion for the presiding judge to acquit their client before jury deliberation begins.Bannon attorney Evan Corcoran had originally requested a direct acquittal, arguing the Department of Justice failed to present an adequate case against his client. Attorney David Schoen echoed these sentiments while claiming Bannon’s legal team was in active negotiations with the so-called select committee rather than ignoring their summon.“He told them from the very first letter he would comply if they go before a judge and the judge orders him, no orders that the executive privilege wasn’t valid,” said Schoen. “As simple as that.

He’s not someone who ignored a subpoena at all times and communicated with them.”Bannon himself reiterated he had previously been bound to silence by former President Donald Trump’s executive privilege and has cooperated with authorities in multiple other manners. He also took the time to call out the panel’s chair, Bennie Thompson.During the trial, the defense called no witnesses and introduced no new evidence. This came after the judge ruled their arguments on executive privilege or the political bias of the January 6 Committee would not be heard.A verdict was reached Friday and a D.C. court found Bannon guilty. He was charged with criminal contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee Investigating January 6.Bannon did not take the stage and his defense did not present a case to the jury. The jury deliberated for around three hours. He will be sentenced October 21 and is now facing a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a $100,000 fine.","Former White House strategist Steve Bannon, left, speaks with reporters as he departs federal court on Tuesday, July 19, 2022, in Washington.

On Thursday, the video sharing platform said it would crackdown on videos containing so-called misinformation about abortion. This could include videos providing instructions on unsafe abortions or information false claims about abortion safety.1/ Starting today and ramping up over the next few weeks, we will remove content that provides instructions for unsafe abortion methods or promotes false claims about abortion safety under our medical misinformation policies. https://t.co/P7A27WPYuD— YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) July 21, 20223/ We’re also launching an information panel that provides viewers with context and information from local and global health authorities under abortion-related videos and above relevant search results. pic.twitter.com/dGzEn4bIb8— YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) July 21, 2022Susan B.

We are glad YouTube has decided to review this type of content and hope they will take appropriate action.”The Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade has increased pressure on technology companies to take steps so that their devices and digital services can’t be used to shadow women seeking abortions or steer them in directions that could threaten their health.This comes as progressive lawmakers are pushing parent-company Google to limit alleged instances of people searching for abortion clinics and being sent to pregnancy centers. Earlier this month, Google announced it will automatically purge information about users who visit abortion clinics or other places that could trigger legal problems in light of the Supreme Court’s court ruling.","FILE PHOTO: YouTube app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:45 AM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022The Supreme Court declined to allow the Biden administration to enforce a policy prioritizing the apprehension and deportation of certain groups of illegal immigrants. In a five-to-four decision Thursday, the high court rejected a request by the administration to put a district court ruling blocking the policies implementation on hold.Under the policy, border officials are instructed to focus on deporting suspected terrorists, people who have committed serious crimes and those caught at the border. Thursday’s decision means the rule will not take effect while the court hears arguments in the administrations appeal and eventually issues a final decision.This comes as the Transportation Security Administration admitted to allowing more than 1,000 illegal migrants to use Department of Homeland Security documents to board domestic flights. During a Senate hearing Thursday, officials from the TSA said they allowed migrants to present items like arrest warrants and deportation notices as a form of identification at its checkpoints. They also admitted to using Border Patrol databases to verify the legitimacy of the documents.Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) commented on this revelation.“Under your tenureship the time’s for screening have gone up, up, up at airports all across the country, including in my home state of Missouri,” stated the lawmaker. “St. Louis is not the sixth longest screening process in the country despite the size of our airport there. People who have done absolutely nothing wrong, who are law-abiding citizens and in every respect are subject to the most invasive screenings at these airports. Yet, you are allowing illegal aliens to present warrant for arrest and waiving them on the airplanes. How does that make sense?”﻿Meanwhile, 10 Republican senators have sent a letter to the DHS demanding an explanation over the policy.","FILE – The Supreme Court is seen at sundown in Washington, on Nov. 6, 2020.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:43 AM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022The House passed the Right to Contraception Act. In a 228-to-195 vote Thursday, lawmakers passed legislation that guarantees the federal right to contraception. Eight Republicans voted in favor of the bill, including Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) , Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.). Rep. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio) and Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) took no position on the bill.NEW:The House passes the Right to Contraception Act by a vote of 228-195, two members voting present— Stephanie Myers (@_StephanieMyers) July 21, 2022The measure aims to protect a person’s ability to access contraceptives and engage in contraception and also protects healthcare providers. This comes after the Supreme Courts’ Roe v. Wade reversal and Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should revisit other decisions such as Griswold vs. Connecticut, which allows access to contraception.“The Supreme Court’s decision was a direct attack on abortion and Americans are now justifiably scared about the future of birth control,” stated Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.). “Republicans across this country will continue their extreme assault on basic freedoms and Justice Thomas made it clear that the Supreme Court will do nothing to protect our fundamental rights from these coordinated attacks.”Republicans, on the other hand, said the push from Democrats is unnecessary. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said contraception likely needs protection from Congress rather than by Congress, adding “if there is any entity you don’t want involved” in contraception choices “it’s the federal government.”Others claim it’s just another pointless bill to entice fear and rile up voters before the midterms. Meanwhile, Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) said it could be dangerous.“The kindest thing I can say about this legislation is that it is duplicative and unnecessary,” he stated. “But unfortunately, it can also be damaging. Contraception is so broadly defined that it could guarantee access to medical abortion pills or even contraceptives that might not have FDA approval.”This came shortly after the House passed a bill codifying gay marriage nationwide. It’s unclear whether both legislations will make it to President Joe Biden’s desk.","Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., makes a point during an event with Democratic women House members and advocates for reproductive freedom ahead of the vote on the Right to Contraception Act, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, July 20, 2022.

In a video posted to Twitter Thursday, she used a graph to show declining gas prices over the past month.This attempt to downplay the issue came after the national average hit more than $5 a gallon in June. While prices have dropped since then, the current national average of $4.41 is still about $2 higher than when President Joe Biden first took office.Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre explains what you need to know about the decline in gas prices over the past month. pic.twitter.com/QpwaQECsH3— The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 22, 2022Jean-Pierre said gas prices aren’t coming down as fast as oil prices, but she claimed gas should continue to decline in the upcoming months. Meanwhile, Biden has refused to take credit for any of the economic woes facing the country that have taken place during his presidency. He has often blamed Russia for the pain at the pump, however,  prices had already risen a dollar per gallon prior to the invasion of Ukraine.Over the past year, fuel prices across the US surged more than 60 percent. Economists have said recent retreat in US gas prices happened due to fears of recession and the degradation of demand. Some claimed Biden actually had nothing to do with it.A March study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank found found half of the inflation rate in quarter four of last year had been triggered by bloated pandemic spending packages. Nonetheless, the Biden administration seems to be telling Americans to be grateful for a slight decline in gas prices as the population continues to feel pain in their pockets.","The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is shown behind the gasoline price board of a gas station in San Francisco, Wednesday, July 20, 2022.
