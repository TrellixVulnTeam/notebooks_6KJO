2022-08-04,5:50 PM PT,LIV golfers file anti-trust lawsuit against PGA Tour,"Hall of fame golfer Phil Mickelson and ten other golfers filed a lawsuit against the Professional Golfer’s Association Tour alleging it broke anti-trust law by suspending them from participating in tour events. The lawsuit filed Wednesday claimed the golfers have devoted the bulk of their professional careers to growing the PGA tour only to be repaid with suspensions, punishments and threats for merely playing professional golf for another organization.PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan declared any golfer that joined LIV Golf was ineligible to participate in PGA tournament play back in June. However, leading sports lawyers said the golfers have a strong case against the PGA.“I read the complaint and read their motion for preliminary injunction,” said Monahan. “It looks like a strong case to me. I think in one of the quotes that is attributed to the PGA Tour, no judge is going to like this quote that’s in the motion for preliminary injunction, was alleged to have been made by a PGA representative, who said ‘we hold all the cards, we don’t want these guys playing, we don’t care what the courts say.”The lawsuit also said the PGA Tour threatened to place lifetime bans on players who participate in any LIV golf event and threatened sponsors and agents to coerce players to abandon opportunities to play in LIV gold events. Monahan claimed the suspended players who are now Saudi Golf League Employees have walked away from the tour and now want back in. They said the association has no intentions to lose the case.“Well, you could certainly do that if the golfers were employees,” he stated. “But they’re not employees and the way that the PGA Tour is organized, they’re independent contractors. So, they’re free to contract with the tour and there are free to contract with other entities under the anti-trust rules in the united states.”Here’s the letter PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan just sent membership regarding today’s lawsuit. I see we’re still going with “Saudi Golf League.” pic.twitter.com/Ajv6VBsG9Q— Dan Rapaport (@Daniel_Rapaport) August 3, 2022The LIV golfers are asking a federal court to lift their suspensions and award them damages and attorneys fees.","FILE – PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan speaks during a news conference before the Travelers Championship golf tournament at TPC River Highlands, on June 22, 2022, in Cromwell, Conn.

Reports Wednesday said Iman Shumpert was stopped at a TSA checkpoint in the Dallas-Fort Worth airport with a little over six ounces of marijuana in his backpack.In addition to 6.12 ounces of marijuana, Shumpert is said to have had a Glock magazine and 14 9mm rounds in his possession, but was not in possession of a firearm. Several states have legalized recreational marijuana and medical marijuana is legal in Texas. However, marijuana remains illegal on a federal level which has jurisdiction over airports and air travel. TSA officers that find drugs are required to report their findings to authorities. The former New York Knicks guard admitted it was weed and tests later confirmed the illicit substance.

He last appeared in an NBA game in February of 2021 while on a 10 day contract with the Nets. Shumpert has not officially retired from the game but has ventured into different areas outside of basketball, winning the 30th season of “Dancing with the Stars” in 2021, releasing multiple studio albums and acting in Showtime’s “The Chi.”There has been no further reporting on whether or not Shumpert was represented by an attorney or whether or not he was released on bond, though he has been active on Twitter as recently as Wednesday, August 3. If convicted on “State Felony Charges,” Shumpert could face up to two years in jail and a $10,000 fine. Shumpert was transported to the airport jail without incident.","FILE – Iman Shumpert arrives at the People’s Choice Awards on Dec. 7, 2021, at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif.

(AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 5:02 PM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022Russia is expressing diplomatic support to China over its major military drills around Taiwan. The Russian government said Thursday that China has the rights to hold military exercises. They also accused the US of causing tensions in the region with Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif) visit to Taiwan.China’s People’s Liberation Army warned last week that it wouldn’t “sit back” if Pelosi travelled to Taiwan. White House National Security Spokesperson John Kirby urged China “not to overact,” calling Beijing the “provocateur” in this situation. Taiwan said it will not escalate the conflict but has directed its armed forces to heighten their readiness.Russia supports China amid Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan visit; Russian foreign ministry in a statement says, ""there is only one China… Taiwan is an inalienable part of China""— Sidhant Sibal (@sidhant) August 3, 2022“We cannot say for sure right now whether she will or will not get there, but everything about this tour and the possible visit to Taiwan is purely provocative,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, said the expected visit was a provocative attempt by Washington to pile pressure on China – with whom Russia has forged a strong partnership in recent years. The Kremlin added that Chinese drills are “understandable” and “absolutely justified.”“The USA is a state provocateur,” Zakharova stated. “Russia confirms the principle of “one China” and opposes the independence of the island in any form.”China views visits by US officials to Taiwan as sending an encouraging signal to the pro-independence camp in the island. Washington does not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by US law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.The announcement comes after China fired multiple missiles around Taiwan merely one day after the House speaker’s visit to Taiwan.","A customer and a staff member watch a news report on the recent tensions between China and Taiwan, at a beauty salon in Taipei, Taiwan, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:46 AM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022President Joe Biden signed a new executive order in an attempt to to circumvent the Supreme Court over their decision on Roe v. Wade. While speaking virtually in front of other top White House officials on Wednesday, the President signed the order, which authorizes the use of Medicaid funds to help pro-abortion states provide the procedure to women traveling to receive an abortion.“Secretary Becerra (Health and Human Services) is going to work with states through Medicaid to allow them to provide reproductive health care for women who live in states where where abortions were are being banned in that state,” Biden stated. “The executive order makes sure healthcare providers comply with federal law, so women don’t face delays or denials of medically necessary care.”I am committed to doing everything in my power, including taking strong action like the Executive Order I signed today, to safeguard access to abortion care. pic.twitter.com/eFXVnlb6j1— President Biden (@POTUS) August 3, 2022This latest attempt to protect so-called reproductive rights has many legal experts raising questions about whether it will violate the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. When asked about the order during a White House press briefing, Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre gave a vague response before vacating the podium.“This does not, uh, will not, uh, will not violate the Hyde Amendment,” she stuttered. “It is law and we follow the law here. I have to go.”Meanwhile, Biden has continued to call on Congress to codify Roe v. Wade into law to ensure abortions nationwide.“I believe Roe got it right, it’s been the law for close to 50 years,” said the President. “And I commit to the American people that we’re doing everything in our power to safeguard access to health care, including the right to choose that women had under Roe v. Wade which was ripped away by this extreme court. But ultimately, Congress must codify the protections of Roe as federal law.”Congress must codify the protections of Roe as federal law.And if Congress fails to act, the people of this country need to make their voices heard.— President Biden (@POTUS) August 3, 2022An official timeline for these changes has yet to be established by the Biden administration.","President Joe Biden speaks at an event on lowering the cost of high-speed internet in the Rose Garden of the White House, Monday, May 9, 2022, in Washington.

County officials apologized to residents of Pinal County on Wednesday for not having enough in-person ballots. Over 20 precincts in the County ran low or were completely out of ballots prior to the polls closing.No official cause as to why there was a shortage has been given, however, Pinal County officials believes high demand and printing errors may have been possible factors.Due to unprecedented demand for in-person ballots, Pinal County has experienced a ballot shortage in certain, limited precincts.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:26 AM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022According to a new study, restaurant and business closures were not an effective way to stop the spread of COVID-19. The data, published in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports, found these closures actually do not contribute to the suppression of the coronavirus.Researchers in Japan conducted the study throughout the two years of lockdowns on the country, following a model where a large pool of subjects periodically answered surveys. According to data they compiled, the closure of restaurants and bars in the country did not lead to a notable decrease in symptoms among the Japanese people, except less cough among college graduates.The study summarized that given the detrimental effects the COVID-19 lockdowns have had on people, alternative measures for full service restaurants and bars should be considered before they are closed completely. The findings come as human rights activists and some American scientists have argued mass lockdowns have harmed society more than they helped.United Nations Women found that the COVID-19 lockdowns have caused a “shadow pandemic” with skyrocketed gender abuse and domestic violence cases. Additionally, the American Medical Association noted a spike in suicide cases in the US during lockdowns.“We can see how the impact of COVID-19 and unemployment can impact social acclimation, mounting bills, housing concerns, interpersonal difficulty, untreated medical concerns, substance misuse,” explained Stephen O’Connor, Health Scientist Administrator at the National Institute of Mental Health. “And how overtime those can manifest into what we deem more suicide specific mechanisms such as sort of a longingness, a variance version of feeling isolated and not belonging.” Though monkeypox cases are rising in the US and variants of the coronavirus continue to cause infections, research indicates lockdowns do not appear to be a viable or practical option to combating either.","A passenger wearing a mask to curb the spread of coronavirus sits on a double-decker bus during a coronavirus lockdown, Friday, March 26, 2021.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:40 AM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022The heaviest sentence towards a January 6 protester was announced on Tuesday, raising eyebrows as the man convicted had never stepped foot in the Capitol building. Guy Reffitt was sentenced to seven and a half years behind bars. This sentencing is less compared to the number of years prosecutors were seeking.Prosecutors demanded a 15-year sentence and wanted the judge to designate Reffitt as a domestic terrorist due to him having a weapon with him on January 6. Back in March, the Texas resident was convicted of carrying a gun on Capitol grounds. While announcing his sentence, the judge refused to designate Reffitt as a terrorist, while citing that he never unholstered his firearm.Reffitt’s wife, Nicole, wasn’t surprised with the outcome. She stated that her husband’s sentencing is just the start of political persecution.“No matter if you are a Liberal, if you’re an Independent, if you’re a Republican, this is not okay.” She continued, “The way that people protest in the future will be determined on their political ideology if it’s okay to charge them or not charge them.”She went on to warn of the repercussions that will unfold from the way the Justice Department has been handling these types of cases.“If we allow our country to keep being driven into the ground by the corrupt, evil politicians here in this city, then one day at your kitchen table the FBI is going to come in and tell you that you stood up at the school board meeting and you are now a domestic terrorist” she said. “So wake up, America. This isn’t just about a guy, Wesley Reffitt. This isn’t about just January 6. This is about our liberties being stomped on.”Reffitt was turned into the authorities by his son, who accused his father of threatening him and his sister if they went to the police. However, his daughter said it wasn’t so cut and dry.“He was not threatening to kill us,” she stated. “And my brother said multiple times that he did not think that his intention was to actually go through with something like that.”In addition to his 87 month prison sentence, Reffitt will have three years of supervised release and will be forced to pay $2,000 in restitution."," A large group of protesters stand on the East steps of the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.

(AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:15 AM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022During a recent interview, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) expressed she believes Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) made the right call in going to Taiwan because the US should never allow China to dictate the nations foreign policy. She continued her thought by stating that conceding to China’s bidding would only fortify their goal to be recognized as the world’s superpower. Blackburn argued that for years members of the Senate and House have always made diplomatic visits to Taiwan and China should not have to change that.We should never allow the Chinese Communist Party to dictate our foreign policy.— Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) August 3, 2022Blackburn’s support is shared amongst 25 other Republicans. Those GOP members officiated their in a joint statement and some of those Republicans shared their thoughts on Twitter.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) publicly praised Pelosi for traveling to Taiwan despite facing threats from the Chinese Communist Party. He believes the visit is a powerful symbolic gesture showing how America is standing up for the island nation. He hopes this, coupled with Washington’s mission to defeat Vladimir Putin in his war with Ukraine, will be an effective deterrent to Chinese aggression.“Look, I think it’s important for us to stand up for a Democratic island directly involved in international commerce that elects its own leaders,” he said.  “We know what the Chinese would like to do to Taiwan, just exactly what they did to Hong Kong. So I approve of her, of her trip. I think she did the right thing.”Glad to see Speaker Pelosi follow through today on her visit to Taiwan.America has never taken orders from the Chinese Communist Party, nor shall we ever. And we will always support the sovereign, independent state of Taiwan and its freedom-loving people.— Mike Pompeo (@mikepompeo) August 2, 2022I support Speaker Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan. For decades, members of Congress have traveled to Taiwan. This travel is consistent with the U.S.'s One China policy to which we are committed. We are also committed now, more than ever, to all elements of the Taiwan Relations Act.— Sen. Jim Inhofe (@JimInhofe) August 2, 2022During a Senator GOP Leadership conference briefing Tuesday, McConnell also gave kudos to the Democrats for their bold foreign policy actions. He commended the successful CIA strike that killed al-Quaeda Leader, Ayman al-Zawahir.The Republican also squawked that the need for the assassination revealed Afghanistan is in a perilous state. He pointed out how Joe Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan sparked a resurgence of terrorist organizations, such as al-Quaeda and the Taliban in the country.“Congratulations to them. But I think it’s also important to remember that about a year ago, we pulled out of Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban was out of power and al-Qaida was not around.” McConnell continued, “So it is noteworthy where al-Zawahri was in Kabul. So al-Qaida is back as a result of the Taliban being back in power. And describing the current situation in Afghanistan as success is utterly absurd.”Biden’s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, is continuing to spin al-Zawahir’s death as a positive. He stressed that Biden’s order showed his commitment to cleaning up Afghanistan despite pulling troops from the country.The Biden administration is committed to protecting Americans from terrorists, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says, following the death of al Qaeda’s leader in a U.S. drone strike: “We will find them and we will take them out.” https://t.co/K4bVkXnBRK pic.twitter.com/OK5fW1GS2E— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) August 2, 2022","Supporters hold a banner outside the hotel where U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is supposed to be staying in Taipei, Taiwan, Tuesday, Aug 2, 2022.

That’s according to two people familiar with the matter said. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:35 PM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022The Biden administration declared Monkeypox a public health emergency. In a press briefing Thursday, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra called on Americans to take Monkeypox seriously as the US posted more than 7,000 cases. The disease has been spreading in the US since May and cases are expected to continue to rise.In light of evolving circumstances on the ground, I am declaring a public health emergency on #monkeypox. We are prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus. We urge every American to take monkeypox seriously.— Secretary Xavier Becerra (@SecBecerra) August 4, 2022He added that the emergency designation allows the government to accelerate the distribution of Monkeypox vaccines. The Biden administration also appointed FEMA officials to coordinate the Moneypox response. This comes after California, New York and Illinois designated Monkeypox a health emergency which prompted calls to do the same on the federal level. A public health emergency opens up funding for disease response and could help accelerate access to existing treatments for the painful disease. Monkeypox vaccines already exist and are in use around the country, but they’re still in short supply.The declaration follows the World Health Organization announcement last month that Monkeypox is a public health emergency of international concern. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and “to potentially require a coordinated international response.”“This public health emergency will allow us to explore different strategies to get vaccines and treatments more quickly out to impacted communities and it will allow us to get more data from jurisdictions so we can effectively track and attack this outbreak,” stated Robert Fenton, White House national Monkeypox response coordinator.The Administration has announced a four-part strategy to combat monkeypox, including:– Scaling production and distribution of vaccines– Making testing more convenient– Expanding access to treatments– Empowering communities impacted or at risk of contracting the virus— The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 4, 2022HHS recently said it’s adding 800,000 doses of Monkeypox vaccines to its stockpile amid calls for mass-vaccination for Monkeypox among the gay circles. Monkeypox causes a rash and lesions along with symptoms like fevers and swollen lymph nodes. It does not spread as easily as COVID-19 and so far experts think it is primarily transmitted through close person-to-person contact.Most cases have appeared among men who have sex with men, though people outside that group have also tested positive for the infection.","FILE – Daniel Rofin, 41, receives a vaccine against Monkeypox from a health professional in medical center in Barcelona, Spain, July 26, 2022.

The nation’s top diplomat stated that the US will continue to have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan strait. The Secretary stressed that any military action by China would not benefit anybody in the region, including the communist nation itself.“Nothing has changed about our position and I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretext to increase its aggressive military activity,” said Blinken. “We and countries around the world believe that escalation serves no one, and could have unintended consequences that serve no one’s interests including ASEAN members and including China.”I join my fellow G7 foreign ministers in reaffirming our shared commitment to maintaining the rules-based international order, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and beyond. https://t.co/jNk62NM1Dw— Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) August 3, 2022Blinken also made it publicly known that the US has directly conveyed its position on Taiwan to the Chinese government.","US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken addresses the media during a press conference in Berlin, Germany, Friday, June 24, 2022.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File PhotoOAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:21 PM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022New York officials are calling for tougher measures to deter recidivism in the city amid rising crime rates. During a press conference Wednesday, Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell called for changes to the bail system to make it easier to keep repeat offenders behind bars.“This is not attacking some of the needed reforms that we have,” Adams said. “This is about a small number of people that are taking advantage of the existing laws to endanger our city.”According to officials, the number of individuals arrested three or more times in a calendar year for crimes such as robbery, burglary and grand larceny has increased through the first six months of 2022. Sewell said repeat offenders have been shown their criminal behavior has no consequences as they’ve been through the system on several occasions.“We are seeing tragedies every day on the streets of this city we love and serve,” voiced Sewell. “People are suffering and more and more are unnecessarily becoming victims. Victims of repeat offenders who have shown that their criminal behavior is given no consequences.”Join me and @NYPDPC Sewell at 1 Police Plaza for an announcement. https://t.co/2P8wBhyJ0d— Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) August 3, 2022Bail reform advocates are not ready to abandon their cause and maintain that the changes that took effect in 2020 should stay on the books.“Let’s not tell New Yorkers all we’ve got to do is to lock up the black and brown people who are the children of the parents we locked up 20 years ago,” Public Advocate Jumaane Williams stated. “That’s not leadership and on top of that you want to lock them up on Riker’s Island, where people are dying on a regular basis waiting for their trial.”Adams, Sewell and law enforcement officials are frustrated by the laws and claimed suspects like Gooding prove their point about the need to fix bail reform. Gooding, 53, who’s also known as Jamel White, served prison time for robbery and burglary convictions in Brooklyn, said police sources. His career of 101 arrests includes 88 busts since the bail laws took effect. Police sources said Gooding has 15 criminal convictions, including two for violent felonies, one for a non-violent felony and 10 for misdemeanors. Sources said Gooding has skipped court hearings at least 14 times.Those on the NYPD’s top 10 recidivist list have between them been arrested 485 times since the bail reform laws took effect. Those 485 arrests amount to 75 percent of the suspects total histories of 642 arrests, the police numbers show. Officials also argued that judges must be allowed to consider the public safety threat a suspect poses when determining if they will be held in pre-trial custody.","FILE PHOTO: New York City Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a news conference about recent shootings of homeless people in both New York and Washington, at the John A.

Ron DeSantis gestures as he speaks during a news conference Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, in Tampa, Fla.

During a press conference Thursday, DeSantis said Warren has continued to ignore the law and his suspension is effective immediately.DeSantis said crime has spiked under the 13th Judicial Circuit in Hillsborough County because prosecutor Warren picks and choosea what laws to enforce based on his personal agenda. Warren recently signed a joint letter promising to avoid prosecuting people for providing or seeking abortions. The letter was published in June by the organization Fair and Just Prosecution, which bills itself as bringing together elected local prosecutors to promote “a justice system grounded in fairness, equity, compassion and fiscal responsibility.”“The role of the state attorney is to apply the law and enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws you like and which laws you don’t like,” DeSantis said. “This is a law and order state. We’re not going to back down from that one inch. We’re not going to allow locally-elected people to veto what our state has decreed through our legislative process. When you’re saying you’re not going to enforce certain laws that you don’t like, that’s neglect of duty that quite frankly is incompetence as defined in Florida law.”Warren signed the letter along with more than 90 prosecutors from various states, some of which have enacted limitations on abortion similar to the Florida measure. The Florida Legislature passed the 15-week abortion restriction this spring, and DeSantis signed it in April. Providers could face third-degree felony charges for breaking the law.“Not all of us agree on a personal or moral level on the issue of abortion. But we stand together in our firm belief that prosecutors have a responsibility to refrain from using limited criminal legal system resources to criminalize personal medical decisions,” the June 24 letter said. “As such, we decline to use our offices’ resources to criminalize reproductive health decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions.”Prosecutors have a duty to enforce the law, not pick and choose which laws they agree with.

While the White House touted the strike on ”Al-Qaeda” leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri at a compound in Afghanistan, Republicans said its only indicative of Afghanistan being a hotspot for terrorists in the region. In a press conference Tuesday, White House National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby asserted the White House ”met its commitment” in regards to controlling terrorist activity in the country.“As President Biden has consistently said, we will not allow Afghanistan to become a safe haven for terrorists who might bring harm to Americans, to the homeland,” said Kirby. “We met that commitment. This action demonstrates that without American forces on the ground in Afghanistan and in harm’s way, we still remain able to identify and locate even the world’s most wanted terrorist and then take the action to remove him from the battlefield.”National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan added onto Kirby’s statement and said Al-Zawahiri’s death has “undoubtedly made the United States safer.” Sullivan noted that the killing of the terrorist justified Biden’s’ withdrawal from Afghanistan last year and asserted that the US no longer needed to keep thousands of troops there.“He was the man who was the most inspirational figure, the strategic leader, someone who sent guidance regularly to affiliates around the world,” Sullivan voiced. “Someone who sent out messages inspiring his followers to attack and kill Americans and harm the United States. Someone who tried to hold together a global network of terrorists that could continue to threaten both America and Americans and taking him out has undoubtedly made the United States safer.”On July 1, President Biden meets with his national security team to discuss the counterterrorism operation to take out Ayman al-Zawahiri. At this meeting, the President was briefed on the proposed operation and shown a model of the safe house where Al-Zawahiri was hiding. pic.twitter.com/W0A0mDk9Lr— The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 2, 2022The White House’s sentiments contrast those of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who pointed to the fact that Al-Zawahri felt safe enough to stay in Kabul and showed the US lack of control of terrorist activities in Afghanistan.“I want to focus for a minute on the successful strike against Al-Zawahri,” McConnell stated. “Our professionals did an extraordinary job. Congratulations to them, but I think it’s also important to remember that about a year ago, we pulled out of Afghanistan. At the time, the Taliban was out of power and Al-Qaeda was not around. So it is noteworthy where Al-Zawahiri was in Kabul. So Al-Qaeda is back as a result of the Taliban being back in power and describing the current situation in Afghanistan as success is utterly absurd.”The targeted CIA attack raised questions about the presence of Al-Qaeda which was supposedly purged from the country. There were many questioning whether the Taliban was providing refuge to the group behind numerous attacks against America, including 9-1-1.Al-Zawarhiri was accused of planning the September 11 attacks as well other bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990’s, among other attacks.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Biden Admin.

(AP Photo/Beth Harris)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:21 AM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022Long time play-by-play broadcaster Vin Scully passed away at his Hidden Hills home in California on Tuesday. The hall of famer is best known for telling the Dodger’s story for nearly seven decades, which marked the longest tenure of any broadcaster with a single team in professional sports history. Scully’s unforgettable voice called Dodger games dating back to 1950 when the team was still in Brooklyn. He was the voice behind the mythical plays of Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson, Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax.Early in his career, the Bronx native made history at the age of 25-years-old becoming the youngest person to call a World Series in 1953. Scully called a record total of 28 World Series either on radio or TV, but it was in the unreal 1988 season that he made his most memorable call.“We have lost an icon,” Dodgers President and CEO Stan Kasten said in a statement. “Vin Scully was one of the greatest voices in all of sports. He was a giant of a man, not only as a broadcaster, but as a humanitarian. He loved people. He loved life. He loved baseball and the Dodgers. And he loved his family. His voice will always be heard and etched in all of our minds forever. I know he was looking forward to joining the love of his life, Sandi. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family during this very difficult time. Vin will be truly missed.”Fans gathered outside Dodger Stadium to pay their respects to the legend. He called his last game for the Dodgers in October 2016, which ended an iconic 67-year run with the team. The Dodgers changed players, managers, executives, owners and even coasts, but Scully and his soothing, insightful style remained a constant for the fans.Dodgers fans have created a memorial for Vin Scully, the namesake for the street that leads to the stadium. 💙 pic.twitter.com/qlg3ND9OWH— FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) August 4, 2022“He was the best there ever was,” Kershaw said after the Dodgers’ game Tuesday night in San Francisco. “Just when you think about the Dodgers, there’s a lot of history here and a lot of people that have come through. It’s just a storied franchise all the way around. But it almost starts with Vin, honestly.There will never be another Vin Scully.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., pauses during A hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, FIle)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:21 AM PT – Thursday, August 4, 2022Republican senators zeroed in on the government’s involvement in the creation of the coronavirus. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) led the first-ever Senate hearing focused on gain-of-function research and the origins of COVID-19 on Wednesday. Paul and GOP Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) pressed three scientists on the role the US government had in research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.In his opening statement, Dr. Richard Ebright defined gain-of-function research as the modification of pathogens to increase their transmissibility and effectiveness against human immune systems and treatments. During multiple exchanges with Sen. Paul, NIH Director Anthony Fauci vehemently denied his agency had funded such projects. However, Ebright alleged in a written statement that Fauci lied to Paul, the press and the American public.Sen. Marshall dug up past statements made by Fauci, touching on the research he was involved with in an almost prophetic way.“Again is 2012, Dr. Fauci also said almost prophetically that he was worried about unregulated laboratories, perhaps outside of the United States, doing work unlawfully and leading to an inadvertent pandemic,” stated the Republican. “And he went on to say the accidental release is what the world is really worried about.”The Kansas lawmaker further outlined Fauci’s problematic past with gain-of-function research in the Obama administration and beyond. Despite moratoriums, Marshall alleged the NIH continued to funnel funds towards the controversial research without reporting it to the proper subcommittee for approval.“Nevertheless, clearly the US government and Dr. Fauci knew that the viral gain-of-function research was very concerning,” he noted. “And almost counterintuitively, while Dr. Fauci encouraged US scientist to pause their GOF studies, Dr. Fauci offshored the paused research to China. Not once but twice.”Paul quoted previous statements made by Ebright, alleging unreviewed funds were distributed for gain-of-function research in Wuhan between 2016 and 2018. Despite the report, so-called experts avoided classifying the creation of COVID chimeras.https://t.co/mmDHU48wJA— Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) August 3, 2022Ebright cited the NIH’s delayed revealing of eco-health experiments with a bat coronavirus in the Wuhan lab. Yet, Fauci tried to discredit the lab leak theory entirely by collaborating with NIH colleague Francis Collins to release the Lancet letter.“One of the efforts was the Lancet letter you discussed,” said Ebright. “The other effort was coordinated and orchestrated effort through the National Institute of Health, through the director Dr. Fauic and NIH Director Dr. Collin, and resulted in the publication of an opinion article entitled ‘Proximal Origins of SARS-CoV-2,’ making the case, again, that SARS-CoV-2 could not have been a product of research related spill over.”Paul closed out the hearing by declaring that no matter the origin of COVID, the risks of such projects far outweigh the benefits for the human race. This comes after Sen. Paul proposed an amendment to the CHIPS Act that would ban taxpayer dollars from funding gain-of-function research in China.","Sen.

Governor Ron DeSantis (R- Fla.) is hoping to “break the cycle of addiction” with the latest expansion of his network.During a press conference on Wednesday at the Space Coast Health Foundation in Rockledge, the Republican announced what’s ahead for his recovery model, which is known as the Coordinated Opioid Recovery (CORE) Network. DeSantis said he’s taking the model, which has already seen successful results, and is bringing it to 12 additional counties.Today we are expanding our Coordinated Opioid Recovery (CORE) Network program, a first-of-its-kind model of care for substance use disorders, to several counties across the state. This model has been proven successful and will break down barriers for those battling addiction. pic.twitter.com/Yx8i8C3upD— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) August 3, 2022 The Governor went on to claim that the fentanyl crisis has accelerated faster than any other drug epidemic in recent months. He warned that those who are putting fentanyl out onto the streets will go to jail.“Fentanyl overdoes account for almost 70 percent of all overdoses in the state of Florida,” he revealed. “Since 2015, fentanyl overdose deaths have increased by almost 800 percent.”Florida Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo said state officials need to focus on helping people who suffer from trauma and stress due to drug addiction. He believes the Core Network will be the new standard.“Ultimately what you would want to do is be able to help people,” said Dr. Ladapo. “One day that will be the standard of care. I am certain of it.”This coordinated effort comes after the state of Florida reported nearly 2,000 fatal overdoes so far this year. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden’s border crisis has led to the largest influx of illegal drugs in the nation’s history.","Florida Gov.
