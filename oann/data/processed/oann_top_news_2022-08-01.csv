2022-07-29,2:18 PM PT,House Minority Leader McCarthy: Democrats have no plan to help Americans,"With the House of Representatives heading towards its summer recess, the House Minority Leader updated the press in his first solo conference since March. On Friday, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) explained his worries about the future while addressing issues he believes have been caused by unified Democrat control of Washington“The Democrats have no plans to help American who are paying the highest prices in 40 years,” he stated. “They have no plan to stop workers from losing an entire months salary because of inflation. They have no plan to bring down the high gas prices that are still costing families more than $4 a gallon. They have no plan to rescue and secure our border or reduce crime. Democrats have no plan to help Americans, but their policies only make it worse.”McCarthy continued to address recent conflicts in the House after being asked his reaction to the mayor of D.C. requesting for the National Guard to help patrol for illegal immigrants in the city and how the Republicans are being accused of using migrants as a political pawn.“Because what has happened because of their actions, every single community in America is now a border city,” he continued. “This is a national crisis. Fentanyl is now the number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. This is their policies, which they created. They created a national security issue throughout the entire country.”McCarthy was also asked about his potential to become Speaker of the House after midterms. As the minority leader, he is a likely choice to become Speaker if Republicans win a majority. He has not agreed with the way Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has handled the position, especially after issues with her husband’s apparent stock purchases.“I think its ironic that the Speaker of the House now talks about bringing up a bill at the very end of a term of Congress,” he noted. “So her husband could trade all the way through, but now it becomes a crisis?The California Republican continued to challenge Democrat policies, illustrating the issues many people have with the apparent effects they have on inflation. From rising gas prices to salary losses and increasing crime, McCarthy believes more needs to be done to fix Democrat failures. The House begins recess in August and representatives will return in September.﻿","House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calif. speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, July 29, 2022.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 4:00 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin (D) responded to the backlash he’s received for striking a deal on a reconciliation package.“I’ve never reversed,” Manchin said. “I’ve never been in reverse in my lifetime and I never walked away.”Senator Manchin defended his controversial decision to strike a deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on a sweeping reconciliation package called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which they said will lower the deficit by over $300 billion over a period of 10 years.In a video released on Thursday, Manchin described the new legislation as a quote win-win for the US. The bill will invest over $369 billion into fighting so-called climate change and extend Obamacare subsidies over the next three years.“So, I think it’s a win-win here, but people are all getting hyped up,” he voiced. “It might help the Democrats and I’m a Republican so I’ve got to be against it. Come on, guys. We’re Americans. Look at the bill, it’s a good bill. It’s a Democrat and Republican bill.”Additionally, he claimed the bill would not raise taxes on anybody though it would impose a 15 percent minimum corporate tax and close so-called tax loop holes for big corporations. The legislation is also estimated to raise another $124 billion by bolstering the IRS to go after tax cheats.“We don’t raise taxes on anybody and anybody that says we’re raising taxes by putting a minimum of 15 percent corporate tax on corporations, the largest corporations have $1 million of book value or greater that that’s going to be inflammatory,” the West Virginia senator stated. “I don’t think many of us can figure out why. When we reduced it from 35 to 21 in 2017, that tax cut was cut by 14 percent so that people weren’t paying at least 15 percent or supposedly paying 21. If someone’s upset they weren’t paying anything please come forward and tell us why you were able to have this great country protect you and give you these opportunities. You didn’t have to pay anything into it.”BIDEN on the Schumer-Manchin reconciliation deal""I want to thank Senator Schumer and Senator Manchin…If enacted, this legislation will be historic, and I urge the Senate to move on this bill as soon as possible, and for the House to follow as well."" pic.twitter.com/L6ii8HFvRK— Alayna Treene (@alaynatreene) July 27, 2022He then went on to claim the legislation will keep the fossil fuel industry strong despite measures to make large investments into so-called climate change programs.“This is a bill that keeps the fossil industry and keeps the country in a very strong position until those new technologies kick in, whenever that may be,” he expressed. “That transition will happen when whatever you have that you’re using, you’ve got something better to replace it with and can do just as well. If not better, cheaper prices. The market takes over.”The package will be put to a vote on the senate floor next week.","Sen.

Scott Applewhite)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:00 AM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022A House Republican has alleged whistleblowers stated the FBI has been tampering with official records and investigations to cover-up scandals created by the Biden administration. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested the FBI exaggerated domestic terrorism statistics to hit performance metrics manufactured by the bureau itself.On Wednesday, Jordan wrote a letter to the agency’s director sharing alleged whistleblower accounts. He said through these accounts he found that FBI officials are “pressuring agents to reclassify cases as domestic violent extremism” even if the cases do not meet the criteria. Jordan went on to say one whistleblower has called it an environment of “pressure” as superiors use these metrics to give awards and promotions.They contend the manipulation is done to satisfy the Biden administration’s narrative that domestic violent extremism is America’s “greatest threat.” One of the implicated operatives is Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault who was also among those previously accused of covering up Hunter Biden’s money trail.🚨 #BREAKING 🚨Whistleblowers: FBI Leadership Pressuring Agents to Artificially Pad Domestic Terrorism Data pic.twitter.com/fGuQbUbjX3— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) July 27, 2022On Monday, Sen.

He was the one making these decisions to shut down or open an investigation. I brought that information to Director Wray, or let’s put it this way, I put out a press release and that guy was moved out of that decision making process.”.⁦@ChuckGrassley⁩ office has been in contact with credible whistleblowers who acknowledged that FBI officials were asked to downplay Evidence of Hunter Biden’s activity/ his laptop and push the claim that these truths were disinformation 👇👇 pic.twitter.com/ACqV21C3x3— Sara A.

This allegation came when a whistleblower told Grassley there has been a pattern of active partisanship at the bureau on matters about investigations of the Trump campaign and Hunter’s suspicious financial deals.To seemingly counter GOP’s investigative efforts, Grassley said that in August 2020 that he and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) were subjected to a “unnecessary” briefing from the FBI, which they said had been “weaponized” against sitting members of the Senate.“I want to know what concrete steps Wray’s is going to take to shut down this partisan approach,” Grassley shared.  “This is hurting the credibility of the FBI.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:20 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022The White House attacked Texas and Arizona amid D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for National Guard Troops to deal with the bus loads of migrants coming from both states. During a press briefing Thursday, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre accused both GOP led states of using migrants as a “political ploy.”“That is shameful and that is just wrong,” voiced Pierre. “What Republicans are doing, the way that they’re meddling in the process and using migrants as a political pawn is just wrong.”Both states have sent thousands of migrants to the nation’s Capital since April as part of an effort to deal with the influx of migrant crossings at the southern border. Jean Pierre said the Biden administration is in touch with Bowser and claimed Texas and Arizona are not following proper protocols.Still, reporters pressed Jean-Pierre on whether the White House “preference” would be for migrants to stay in small towns in Texas and Arizona rather than coming to big cities. She said migrants should be expelled under Title 42, transferred into custody or placed in the care of local organizations for proper processing.“That is not what I said. They said that they’re sending migrants to big cities on purpose using them as a political point,” she responded. “I’m saying is what Republicans are doing is wrong and there is a process in place. We should follow the process. There’s a legal process in place and they should follow it.”""So the White House's preference would be for small towns in Texas and Arizona to have to take care of these migrants instead of a large metropolitan city like Washington, D.C.?""KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: ""There's a process.""🤔 pic.twitter.com/GEXMp1dnH5— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 28, 2022In response to Bowser’s request, Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas) pointed out that D.C. finally understands what Texas is dealing with. He said thousands of migrants have overwhelmed and overrun Lone Star State communities.“Washington D.C. finally understands what Texans have been dealing with every single day as our communities are overrun and overwhelmed by thousands of illegal immigrants thanks to President Biden’s open border policies,” Abbott’s office said in a statement. “If the mayor wants a solution to this crisis she should call on President Biden to take immediate action to secure the border, something he has failed to do. The true ongoing humanitarian crisis is along our southern border.” BREAKING REPORT: DC Mayor Muriel Bowser claims her city's HOMELESS SHELTERS ARE FILLING UP WITH MIGRANTS from Arizona and Texas, as she hits back at Texas Gov.

2022-07-29,12:00 PM PT,Report: Chinese Embassy pressures US lawmakers,"Report: Chinese Embassy pressures US lawmakersOAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:00 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022The Chinese Embassy in Washington has reportedly warned US lawmakers not to join House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on her possible trip to Taiwan. According to NBC News on Thursday, cited Congressman Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) claimed that Chinese diplomats are trying to pressure lawmakers into preventing Pelosi from going to Taiwan.In addition, the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco is reportedly contacting US lawmakers with a similar demand. This after China threatened Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan posed a risk of military conflict in the far east. Meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Biden earlier on Thursday that the US is “playing with fire” over Taiwan.“I think should Speaker Pelosi proceed with the trip, it would coincide with the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army in China,” said Mark Cozad, acting associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corp. “We’re likely, I think, to see an increase and a noticeable increase in Chinese airspace incursions in and around Taiwan in the event that she proceeds with her trip. We may even see something called a median line incursion and that’s a breach of the maritime border that exists in the center of the Taiwan Strait.”They also said that a stepped up US military presence to safeguard Pelosi risked raising tensions. US lawmakers said it is a “miscalculation” on China’s part to try and pressure them.The #Chinese side has repeatedly made clear to the #US side our serious concern over Speaker Pelosi’s planed visit to #Taiwan and our firm opposition.

(AP Photo/Christian Chavez)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:40 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022Authorities discovered nearly 100 migrants bound for the US hidden inside an abandoned trailer in Southern Mexico. Ninety-eight migrants, including several children, from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were found on the side of the highway in Veracruz on Wednesday.Paramedics estimated around 400 people could have been in the trailer at one time, but frantically tried to escape once they started running out of air. Many of the migrants were injured while attempting to get out.“We were told there were close to 400 immigrants travelling in the trailer,” said Cristobal Cisneros Valencia, Civil Protection Paramedic. “When they started to feel suffocated, they hit the roof of the trailer and most of them jumped out. That is why most of the injuries we treated were ankle and knee fractures with damaged sense of balance. We had to move one person (to a hospital for treatment) because he was unconscious.” According to border officials, transporting migrants in truck-trailers is one of the most dangerous methods smugglers use. A recent New York Times report noted cartels are earning an estimated $13 billion annually from the illicit practice. Revenue soared from an estimated $500 million back in 2018 as cartels have ramped up their involvement in human smuggling operations over the past few years.The billions in earnings from those activities exclude revenue from drug smuggling. According to congressional testimony from the Acting Director of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last year, cartels are becoming more profitable as they have teams have teams specializing in logistics, transportation, surveillance, stash houses and accounting.This comes as the Biden administration’s lax border policies encourage migrants to make the journey. Around 1.7 million migrants and unaccompanied child have crossed the border since President Joe Biden took office.","People cross the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico into El Paso, Texas, Tuesday, March 23, 2021.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:45 AM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022The House passed the $280 billion CHIPS Act. All but one Democrat and a cohort of Republicans pushed the legislation through in a 243-to-187 vote on Thursday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the spending package while claiming it would put taxpayer money towards union jobs and lowering costs.“Make it in America, as Mr. Hollier would say,” stated Pelosi. “Doing so is an economic imperative creating again nearly 100,000 good paying union jobs and lowering costs for American consumers, while producing a crucial component of nearly every major technology we enjoy.”The bill provides subsidies to domestic semiconductor manufacturing and invests billions in science and technology to help the US compete on the world stage. Fifty-two billion dollars is set aside specifically for microchip makers in the US to encourage them to build plants in America. However, the total cost of the bill is estimated to balloon up to $280 billion over the next five years.House Republican leadership attempted to rally against the bill, but to no avail. In the lead up to the vote, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) lambasted the bill as wasteful spending in a time of economic turbulence.McCarthy said the Senate passed a bill that took a small program and “turned it into a $280 billion blank check.” He added, it includes millions in mandatory spending on corporate welfare for whoever President Biden chooses.The stated objective of the bill is to jump start American semiconductor production to outpace China and ensure American technological independence should Taiwan fall to the People’s Republic. However, Rep. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) argued that pork is more prevalent in the bill than resource war logistics.“Chips are one of 10 sectors where China is seeking to break American dominance,” he noted. “This bill does not address our issues with China and it certainly does not address issues, the other nine issues.”The legislation moved through the Senate Wednesday and is now headed to President Biden’s desk.","FILE – The inside of a computer is seen on Feb 23, 2019, in Jersey City, N.J.

Cramer added, the bill neglects the country’s real economic problems to address hypothetical ones.“There’s like, what is it, 50 or 60 billion dollars for a green bank?” he asked. “Five billion dollars for urban trees? I mean, give me a break. We’ve got real serious problems in this country and they want to give money away for tree planting for crying out loud.”I have tried to work across party lines when it makes sense, but this Democratic power grab through reconciliation will make every economic problem in America worse. Terrible deal.— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) July 28, 2022Also on Thursday, Sen.

The report also showed that there was a lack of an effective incident commander to take charge at the scene that inhibited information flow. The incident is under investigation for local law enforcement’s delay in responding to the attack.During her time in the hospital, Mayah was visited by country singer Kevin Fowler earlier this month after her family was unable to attend his concert due to her extensive injuries.

His physician doctor Kevin O’Connor confirmed Biden tested positive Saturday, after testing negative over the last few days. He described this a rebound case as he previously tested positive on July 21. Biden reportedly has not seen a re-emergence of symptoms and will not be restarting any kind of treatment, but he will be heading back to isolation.Folks, today I tested positive for COVID again. This happens with a small minority of folks. I’ve got no symptoms but I am going to isolate for the safety of everyone around me. I’m still at work, and will be back on the road soon.— President Biden (@POTUS) July 30, 2022He canceled plans to travel to his home in Delaware Sunday and to Michigan where he was expected on Tuesday to tout the recently passed bill aimed at boosting US semiconductor production, the White House said Saturday.

Paxlovid is an at-home anti-viral therapy for those at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.A study published in June that has not yet been peer-reviewed found that of 13,644 adults, about five percent tested positive again within 30 days and six percent experienced symptoms again.Biden is fully vaccinated and has received two booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks about the economy during a meeting with CEOs in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Thursday, July 28, 2022.

Colorado Secretary of State candidate Tina Peters got the recount after she raised nearly a quarter of a million dollars. A Mesa County clerk and recorder claimed that a logic and accuracy test of the voting machines in El Paso County spit out over half of the 4,000 test ballots for adjudication.Less than one percent should be adjudicated according to experts familiar with the machines. Due to this alleged inaccuracy, Peters is demanding El Paso county detain the machines and conduct a hand recount.

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Sunday, July 31, 2022Nevada’s receding Lake Mead waters uncovered human remains and a historical relic. This week, a body was found lodged in mud at the lake’s shoreline as water levels in the reservoir hits an all-time low. The body is the third to be found following two others earlier this year which prompted officials to investigate their origins. However, many speculate the finds were mob-related hits as the first body was analyzed to be over a decade old. A fourth body was also found Thursday which officials said is from a 31-year-old male kayaker who was reported missing and is believed to have drowned.“Park rangers are on scene and have set a perimeter to recover the remains,” the National Park Service said in a statement. “The Clark County Medical Examiner has been contacted to determine the cause of death. The investigation is ongoing.”We are out at Lake Mead where more human remains were found just yesterday. This is the third discovery of remains since beginning of May.

It was formed with the creation of the Hoover Dam which submerged St. Thomas, a Mormon settlement founded in 1865. One of the town’s final residents left in 1938 when waters reached his front door, according to the Deseret News. Declining lake levels which have exposed St. Thomas several times over the years have kept the settlement visible for the last 10 years.Additionally, a World War II era boat also emerged from the shrinking reservoir.","FILE – A formerly sunken boat sits on cracked earth hundreds of feet from the shoreline of Lake Mead at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area on May 10, 2022, near Boulder City, Nev.

Erica Johnson was last seen getting off a bus in the early morning hours of July 8 when she boarded another greyhound bus to Tampa. Her family suspected something unusual was happening with Johnson prior to her disappearance. They reported her missing on July 14.“That means she may have been going through some kind of stressful moment,” said WINK News Safety and Security Specialist Rich Kolko. “So that elevates the concern for law enforcement and her family members. It may be possibly why they say she may be in some harms way.”In an interview, they said Johnson canceled plans with her ex-husband to see their children and claimed she needed to work. Backing her family’s suspicions, investigators upgraded Johnson’s case to that of a “missing and endangered adult.”“They know this woman uses this bus stop,” Kolko voiced. “She’s used it at least those two days. Where did that bus go? Did somebody see her get off the bus? Did someone see her get met by somebody when she got off the bus?”UPDATED: 7/28/2022, Ms. Johnson boarded a Greyhound bus in Fort Myers on the morning of July 8th, 2022 which departed for Tampa. She was carrying bags, a travel pillow, and her bunny.

(AP Photo/Jason Behnken, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 5:00 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022A collection of sports doctors and scientists said they’ve found conclusive evidence that CTE is caused by successive head trauma. Neuroscientists claimed that the deadly degenerative disease observed in players of contact sports is definitely caused by constant head trauma.Researchers from nine universities in collaboration with the Concussion Legacy Foundation found a correlation between traumatic head injury and development of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. They found athletes who participated in contact sports were 68 times more likely to develop this fatal ailment than those who didn’t. Former NFL Wide Receiver Demaryius Thomas was diagnosed with stage two CTE after he was found dead in the bathroom of his Georgia home in December.CTE can only be diagnosed through posthumous brain tissue analysis but can be marked in a living person by symptoms of aggression, memory loss and severe personality changes.“There’s no question that there’s a problem in football. That people who play football are at risk for this disease,” said Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University’s CTE Center and coauthor of the new study. “We urgently need to find answers for not just football players, but Veterans and other individuals exposed to head trauma.”Officials said while concussions can lead to CTE, it’s often the numerous small hits which occur during contact sport competitions which lead to the degenerative disease. In a separate study, CTE was found in 99 percent of all deceased NFL players whose brains were donated to science as well as a number of high school, semi-pro and professional soccer players. Researchers said these findings could be used to push lawmakers to address CTE as a public health crisis among young adults in contact sports.“The medical and scientific communities will benefit from this publication and the NFL will continue to work with a wide range of experts to improve the health of current and former NFL athletes,” the NFL told CNN in a statement. “There are still many unanswered questions relating to the cause, incidence and prevalence of long-term effects of head trauma such as CTE.”Former NFL player Demaryius Thomas was suffering from stage 2 CTE when he died late last year, according to his parents.Former NFL star wide receiver Demaryius Thomas had CTE when he died, parents say pic.twitter.com/66ymJwOkNg— Billy Zavala (@BillyZavala10) July 29, 2022The research indicated CTE is environmentally caused, meaning sports leagues like the NFL may be legally accountable for not minimizing brain damage in their players.“The NFL is committed to supporting scientific research into CTE and advancing progress in the prevention and treatment of head injuries,” the NFL statement on the study said. “In 2016, the NFL pledged $100 million in support for independent medical research and engineering advancements in neuroscience related topics. This is in addition to the $100 million that the NFL and its partners are already spending on medical and neuroscience research.”Former #Bears center Mike Pyle died 7 years ago today.

Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / APOAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:20 PM PT – Friday, July 29, 2022Senate Republicans discussed the rise in crime that’s affecting communities across the nation amid soft-on-crime Democrat policies. On Capitol Hill Thursday, Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) were among those who spoke on the policies. Senator Cornyn highlighted the amount of drugs coming across the border due to the open border policies. He noted that 108,000 Americans died of overdoses last year marking an all-time high.“Almost all of those drugs come across the south western border and the human smugglers and the drug cartel’s understand that if they overwhelm the capacity of the border patrol to stop illegal immigration and drugs from coming across, that they can divert the attention of the border patrol and open up a 4-lane highway for the exportation of illegal drugs into the United States,” said Cornyn.He pointed out that the Biden administration failure to recognize the rise in gun violence, drug smuggling and criminal street gangs are all connected to the open border policy. Senator Cotton stressed that the man who is accused of attempting to stab GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) was immediately released under New York’s lax bail laws.“The reasons for this crime wave is simple,” voiced Cotton. “The Democrat party cares more about criminals than it does about victims. Today’s Democrats want to defund, disarm and demonize our police. They elect extreme Soros prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law as it is written and they’ve abolished bail in some places, including New York.”NOW: Senate Republicans discuss the rising crime affecting communities across the country, thanks to soft-on-crime democrat policies.  https://t.co/oxjH4uGQ8Q— Senate Republicans (@SenateGOP) July 27, 2022Cotton said liberals are refusing to allow police to enforce the law and imprison those who violate the law. He added, Democrat voters in San Francisco voted to remove District Attorney Chesa Boudin from office claiming his progressive agenda was leading to high levels of crime on the streets.Additionally, residents in Los Angeles are ousting L.A. County District Attorney George Gascon after prosecutors have argued “criminals feel emboldened, residents unsafe and victims abandoned as he fails to prosecute a slew of crimes.”GOP senators went on to suggest disorder and chaos will only continue throughout the US as long as Democrats push their soft-on-crime policies.",Cornyn.
