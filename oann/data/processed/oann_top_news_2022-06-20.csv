Doctor Simone Gold was sentenced to two months behind bars this week, after she pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge of illegally entering the restricted building in March.Gold, a former emergency room physician, has since expressed regret in participating in the Capitol events, asserting she ”should not have been there.” Gold followed a crowd into the Capitol, but claimed she didn’t witness any violence and didn’t think she was breaking any laws.“I can certainly speak to the place that I was and it most emphatically was not a riot,” Gold said. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”California doctor sentenced to prison for storming the US Capitol on January 6.

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., speaks during a Students Demand Action event, near the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, Monday, June 6, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:45 PM PT – Saturday, June 18 2022A pair of Senators proposed a reconstruction of the US policy toward Taiwan seemingly drifting away from America’s One China policy. Senators from both sides of the aisle proposed legislation to clarify and strengthen the nation’s commitment to Taiwan’s Democracy.On Friday, Senators Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) introduced the “Taiwan Policy Act” of 2022, which included $4.5 billion in military assistance to Taiwan for over four years. The bill would also designate the island as a “Major non-NATO Ally.”Though the bill is aimed to boost US support for Taiwan, President Biden insisted he is not seeking any major changes and even walked back a previous claim to use the military to defend the island if China were to attack it.“The policy is not changed at all,” Biden said. ” I stated that when I made my statement yesterday.”Despite ambiguity from the US, China asserted it would never allow the secession of Taiwan, which the communist-ruled nation considered to be part of the country.“Gone are the days when western invaders could take over a country by setting up a few cannons on the coast in the east,” Chinese politician Liu Jieyi voiced. “Anyone should not underestimate the firm determination, the strong will and the powerful ability of Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity! We will never allow any people or any forces to separate Taiwan from China.”Additionally, China’s Ministry of National Defense claimed that the US is only using Taiwan to contain China from rising as the new world power. Menendez and Graham appeared to be undeterred by China’s stance on the issue. In a statement on his bill, Menendez said their should be no doubts about America’s determination to stand with the people of Taiwan and Democracy.“The One China principle is the political foundation of China and US relations,” stated Wu Qian, a spokesman for Chinese Ministry of National Defense. “Using Taiwan to contain China is doomed to fail.”Graham stressed the US must show strength in the face of Chinese aggression towards Taiwan. If passed, the bill would allow arms sales to Taiwan to be prioritized and expedited until Congress determines the security threat to the island has severely diminished.Graham said he is hopeful the proposed legislation will receive bipartisan support and will be backed by the Biden administration.","Sen.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:05 PM PT – Friday, June 17 2022President Joe Biden signed legislation to improve the oversight of ocean shipping. The “Ocean Shipping Reform Act” was signed Thursday. It is designed to help curb inflation, ease shipping back-logs and lower costs for American families. The bill prohibits ocean carriers from refusing to carry US exports.“This bill is going to help bring down inflation at least marginally for farmers and businesses all across America,” said Biden.The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 is an example of what government looks like when we work together across the aisle to solve the real problems facing families.I'm proud to have signed the bill to bring down costs for American businesses and the families that rely on them. pic.twitter.com/OLUXVggZxu— President Biden (@POTUS) June 17, 2022The bill also gives the Federal Maritime Commission the authority to investigate late fees charged by ocean carriers and terminals, which in turn are passed on to consumers and added to inflation. Extra fees for transporting countless products are a hidden and a large source of inflation controlled by ocean carriers.“During the pandemic, these carriers increased their prices by as much as 1,000%, 1,000%,” Biden voiced. “While families and businesses struggled around the world, these carriers made $190 billion in profit in 2021. Seven times higher than the year before.”The vast majority of global ocean shipping is controlled by nine major companies.Nine.During the pandemic, these carriers increased their prices as much as 1,000% — the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 allows us to crack down on those excessive hikes.— President Biden (@POTUS) June 16, 2022The law also requires carriers to provide quarterly updates of imports, exports and empty export containers.

Wade, Tuesday, June 14, 2022, from her ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:30 AM PT – Friday, June 17 2022Vice President Kamala Harris is set to lead the Biden administration’s latest disinformation task force, which appears to be disguised as programs and policies. On Thursday, White House officials unveiled plans they claim are intended to protect “political figures” and journalists from “misinformation” as well as “abuse.”According to the presidential memorandum. the task force protects the online expression of those seeking government roles from internet critics. Some have seen this as a preemptive defense measure for future Biden nominees as disinformation czar Nina Jankowicz resigned after her internet footprint resurfaced during her nomination process.However, Harris claimed the measure will shield all members of the intersectional community from disproportionate online scrutiny.“The internet is a place of fear. One in three women under the age of 35 report being sexually harassed online,” she noted. “Over half of the LGBTQ+ people in our country are survivors of severe harassment. Nearly one in four Asian Americans report being called an offensive name, usually motivated by racism.”Harris touted the task force as a way for the government to make the internet safe, covering a variety of sectors such as online extremism to protecting a woman’s location as she is receiving an abortion. The Vice President claimed laws must change with the times and promised increased funding to train officials on the new protocol.“The collective work will help modernize the federal government’s response to violence against women and people of all genders,” she stated. “It will lead to more evidence informed policies and interventions. And it will support more federal funding to address online harassment and abuse, including grants to train law enforcement and prosecutors.”This new task force will include Attorney General Merrick Garland and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and will submit its blueprint to combat gender-based violence to multiple agencies within the next six months. Within the next year it will issue recommended measures to be taken by internet platforms, stand and local governments and schools.In April, critics slammed President Biden for what they believed was his attempt to create a “dystopian” disinformation bureau intended for the government to patrol online free speech. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre could not clarify how the new task force will differ from the disinformation governance board.Watch the full briefing here:﻿","Vice President Kamala Harrisspeaks during a meeting about abortion rights and Roe v.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:00 PM PT – Friday, June 17 2022Men’s Mental Health Month puts a spotlight on mental healthcare in a demographic which it’s often ignored. According to Mental Health America, men die by suicide 4x higher than women and are often told to “man up” or bottle their emotions. Culturally, American men are looked at as the breadwinners of their families, which some claim is an immense responsibility.“Too many men feel pressure to stay quiet about mental health,” said Katie Dolieslager with the Arrow Project. “Many of the men I’ve worked with don’t know where to find help or they were coping alone.”Their has been a lot of pressure on men to be unwavering and to provide financially for their families over the years. That type of responsibility can create high levels of stress and anxiety. On top of that, men may have a genetic predisposition to mental health issues, or they may experience trauma from work or military experiences.“It has to do with men just culturally being kind of taught and brought up to hold things in,” stated Chris Mason, Board Member with National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) of the Central Shenandoah Valley. This month is men’s mental health month, big shoutout to all men who have been going through a lot alone because they can’t share their problems with anyone since men were taught to “man up” rather than “speak up”. You’re strong. I respect you.— Shola (@jayythedope) June 9, 2022 Experts said proper sleep habits, nutrition, physical activity and stress management are all key contributors to a sound mind. More than six million men are estimated to suffer from depression every year nationwide. As time goes on, there will likely be more space for men to express feelings openly without backlash.“If we get it out where men can say, You know what? It’s OK to speak with someone, we will will be ok,” voiced professor Danny Burgess.  “That seeing someone doesn’t mean you’re crazy or weak, or any of the things. The stigma labels that sometimes. Then maybe we can intervene at an earlier point to not get to that point where they’re considering suicide and attempting with very lethal means.”Officials are now looking to break the stigma around mental health treatment.","FILE – In this March 19, 2020, file photo Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, left, accompanied by Gen.

According to Bloomberg News on Thursday, the Biden administration considered holding a talk with Xi this summer amid attempts to bring down inflation in the US.“I think you could see some tariffs lifted,” said AGF Investments Chief US Policy Strategist Greg Valliere. “Their is a fight within the administration right now. The New York Times had a good piece on this yesterday, between people who feel the tariff should be listed and others who say no.”The sides are expected to discuss steps to prevent escalation in mutual tensions. Previously, Biden’s officials condemned China for refusing to join anti-Russian sanctions and advancing it’s political influence in Southeast Asia.Back in May, Biden landed in South Korea and met with new President Yoon Suk-yeol. He had North Korea at the top of his agenda. He also spoke with Jinping during the visit. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan predicted the two would speak again soon following the conversation.Tune in as I deliver remarks with President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. https://t.co/vnkjCXQQfw— President Biden (@POTUS) May 20, 2022“I wouldn’t be surprised if in the coming weeks President Biden and President Xi speak again,” Sullivan voiced.Sullivan previously spoke with Yang Jiechi, a key foreign policy adviser to Xi. He claimed he was “direct with him about our concerns about North Korea’s nuclear and missile activities and our view that this is not in China’s interests.”“It’s not in America’s interests,” he stated. “China should contemplate taking whatever steps it can to reduce the possibility of a provocative North Korean Act. We had a good back and forth on that subject.”The Biden admin still stands ready to meet North Korea without preconditions says @SecBlinken. He does not take that offer off the table when asked if it would stand if North Korea conducts a nuclear test.— Kylie Atwood (@kylieatwood) June 13, 2022In the meantime, a potential phone call between Biden and Xi could take place as soon as July.

Ronny Jackson claimed the US President does not appear to be “physically or cognitively fit”. He urged the President to come to terms with accepting that his job is “demanding”.“He’s not inspiring confidence,” Jackson said. “It’s sending the wrong message to our adversaries.”Following the incident, he was met with a round of applause and the White House released a statement saying no medical attention was needed. Delaware reporters went on to ask Biden if he was satisfied with the progress on gun legislation.“In Delaware I am,” the President voiced. “Did you see what they did in Delaware? Passed an assaults weapons ban. They did what I did years ago and I am happy with the progress.”The Biden’s are spending the weekend at their home in Rehoboth Beach, in celebration of their 45th wedding anniversary. Biden said he looks forward to spending time with his family.","President Joe Biden gets back on his bike after he fell when he tried to get off his bike to greet a crowd at Gordons Pond in Rehoboth Beach, Del., Saturday, June 18, 2022.

The video appeared to show the two American’s deemed missing, 39-year-old Alex Drueke and 27-year-old Andy Huynh. This confirmed they were taken captive by Russian Forces.The US Government has yet to confirm it’s authenticity, but Drueke’s mother told The Guardian that the video gives her “great hope.” She said it seemed to be her son. In another clip he can be heard saying “I am against war” in Russian.“Mom, I just want to let you know that I’m alive and I hope to be back home as soon as I can,” Drueke said in the video. “So love Diesel for me, love you.”Captured #US mercenary Alexander J Drueke now says that he is against war.He is former member of 74D MOS (army classification for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear specialists CBRN).What is chemical expert doing in Ukraine?#Kharkov #Russia pic.twitter.com/dUliqJX7mI— Luka (@Luka_zgd) June 17, 2022The pair reportedly went missing on June 9, when their group came under heavy fire by Russian troops in Kharkiv. Huynh said Ukrainian Forces asked them to cover their retreat.“when we were covering them the Russian Forces over-ran our position,” Huynh stated. “We had to fully retreat. One of my colleagues and I waited three hours in a fighting hole just to make sure the coast was clear. After those three hours we ended up walking through the woods for about five hours, we eventually got on to a road, when we surrendered to Russian Forces.”Second captured #US mercenary Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh testified about how Drueke and him were captured in #Kharkov region by #Russian forces.#Ukraine#UkraineWar pic.twitter.com/aoNnqGNywS— Luka (@Luka_zgd) June 17, 2022This comes amid reports that a third American who volunteered to fight in Ukraine has gone missing. The family of former Marine Corps Officer Grady Kurpasi has confirmed he’s been missing since late April to multiple outlets. His wife told CNN the State Department is treating Kurpasi as missing in action.Meanwhile, Russia has insisted any foreign fighters in Ukraine will be considered mercenaries.
