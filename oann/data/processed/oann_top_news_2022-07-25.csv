2:45 PM PT",Trump endorses Tim Michels for Wis. Gov.,"Former President Donald Trump endorsed businessman Tim Michels (R) for Wisconsin governor. In a post on Truth Social Friday, Trump expressed his support for the Republican candidate hoping to unseat the Democrat incumbent Gov. Tony Evers (D-Wis.).“Wisconsin needs a governor who will stop inflation, uphold the rule of law, strengthen our borders and end the well-documented fraud in our elections,” Trump said. “Tim Michels is the best candidate to deliver meaningful solutions to these problems and he will produce jobs like no one else can even imagine.”He emphasized Michel’s experience serving under his administration on the infrastructure task force. Trump was also critical of Ever’s mishandling of the COVID pandemic and the rise of crime in the state. The endorsement gives Trump a chance to claim bragging rights in Wisconsin, two years after he narrowly lost the state and two years before he could be on the ballot again.“I appreciate President Trump’s endorsement and vote of confidence,” Michels voiced. “This is a tremendous boost to our efforts and a continuation of our astounding surge since I entered the race.”Donald Trump just sent out this statement, which appears to be the exact same one he sent when he endorsed Tim Michels last month. pic.twitter.com/yJny3RC0EL— Jessie Opoien (@jessieopie) July 22, 2022The 45th president said Michels was the best candidate to provide solutions for these problems.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:53 PM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022A Kentucky judge continues to block the state’s near-total ban on abortions. On Friday, Judge Mitch Perry extended his June order which blocked the state from enforcing its so-called “trigger law” that bans abortions after six weeks.The ruling claimed the law would violate residents right to privacy and self determination. Finding significant state constitutional questions about the two laws, Perry ordered them blocked until the dispute is resolved at trial. A trial date has not been set.“Once again, the courts have rightly stopped Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s relentless efforts to ban abortion, which would have devastating consequences for Kentuckians,” said a Planned Parenthood spokesperson. “No one should be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will or flee the state to access essential health care. Kentuckians have a right to abortion under the state constitution and we’ll continue fighting for that right so that every person in the commonwealth can get the care they need.”BREAKING: A Kentucky state court has granted our request to block enforcement of abortion bans as our lawsuit continues.Abortion remains legal in Kentucky and people can still get an abortion in Kentucky.— ACLU of Kentucky (@ACLUofKY) July 22, 2022Cameron, a Republican who has been seeking to enforce the two laws and other abortion legislation enacted by the GOP-controlled General Assembly, issued a statement that he was “disappointed” with Perry’s ruling and planned to appeal.“The judge’s suggestion that Kentucky’s constitution contains a right to abortion is not grounded in the text and history of our state’s governing document,” Cameron voiced. “We will continue our steadfast defense of these bipartisan laws that represent the commonwealth’s commitment to the lives of the unborn.”Perry’s order found that “the fundamental right for a woman to control her own body free from government interference” outweighs the state’s interest in protecting a fetus before it is viable. In his order, Perry was determined that abortion services are health care, a point disputed by abortion opponents.“Plaintiffs assert and this court agrees, that abortion is a form of health care,” the judge stated. “It is provided by licensed medical professionals in licensed medical facilities, just like many other medical procedures.”In the meantime, Cameron continues to vow to fight this decision at the appellate level.","Supporters of abortion rights chant slogans outside a Planned Parenthood clinic during a protest in West Hollywood, Calif., Friday, June 24, 2022.

During a virtual meeting with his economic team Friday, Biden said gas prices have fallen every day this summer for a consecutive 38 days. The average price at the pump topped $5 nationwide in June and according to Biden gas is just under $4 in over 35 states. He said the US is producing 12 million barrels of oil a day and is on track to near record highs, but claimed prices of oil and gas aren’t coming down fast enough.Tune in as I meet virtually with my economic team on how gas prices are coming down for American families. https://t.co/ogpWg6fsJb— President Biden (@POTUS) July 22, 2022“I’ve been working to make sure that when the price of oil comes down, the price at the pump comes down as well and comes down in real time,” Biden said during the meeting. “The good news is that’s happening, but it’s not happening fast enough. We’ve made progress, but prices are still too high.”Biden said his administration will be looking at ways to increase oil production from existing wells and permits. He called on the US oil industry to do its part as well.“My message to these companies is use the permits or lose them,” he voiced. “Secondly, I’m telling the industry: you’re making record profits due to Putin’s war in Ukraine. Use those profits to increase production and refining. Don’t use those profits to buy back your stocks and dividends.”Biden said while he plans to continue his efforts to keep gas prices falling in the US, the longer term answer is a “clean energy economy” that focuses on renewable energy and more affordable electric vehicles.Biden affirmed his administration will continue working on ways to increase oil production from existing wells and permits.","The price of regular unleaded gas is advertised for just under $4 a gallon at a Woodman’s, Wednesday, July 20, 2022, in Menomonie Falls, Wis.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:15 PM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022“I stand with Trump and the Constitution. Thank you very much.” — Steve BannonFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon reaffirmed his innocence on charges of ignoring a subpoena issued by the January 6 Committee. Attorneys representing Bannon concluded his defense on Thursday and made a motion for the presiding judge to acquit their client before jury deliberation begins.Bannon attorney Evan Corcoran had originally requested a direct acquittal, arguing the Department of Justice failed to present an adequate case against his client. Attorney David Schoen echoed these sentiments while claiming Bannon’s legal team was in active negotiations with the so-called select committee rather than ignoring their summon.“He told them from the very first letter he would comply if they go before a judge and the judge orders him, no orders that the executive privilege wasn’t valid,” said Schoen. “As simple as that. He’s not someone who thought he was above the law ever. He’s not someone who ignored a subpoena at all times and communicated with them.”Bannon himself reiterated he had previously been bound to silence by former President Donald Trump’s executive privilege and has cooperated with authorities in multiple other manners. He also took the time to call out the panel’s chair, Bennie Thompson.During the trial, the defense called no witnesses and introduced no new evidence. This came after the judge ruled their arguments on executive privilege or the political bias of the January 6 Committee would not be heard.A verdict was reached Friday and a D.C. court found Bannon guilty. He was charged with criminal contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee Investigating January 6.Bannon did not take the stage and his defense did not present a case to the jury. The jury deliberated for around three hours. He will be sentenced October 21 and is now facing a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a $100,000 fine.","Former White House strategist Steve Bannon, left, speaks with reporters as he departs federal court on Tuesday, July 19, 2022, in Washington.

Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:45 AM PT – Friday, July 22, 2022The Supreme Court declined to allow the Biden administration to enforce a policy prioritizing the apprehension and deportation of certain groups of illegal immigrants. In a five-to-four decision Thursday, the high court rejected a request by the administration to put a district court ruling blocking the policies implementation on hold.Under the policy, border officials are instructed to focus on deporting suspected terrorists, people who have committed serious crimes and those caught at the border. Thursday’s decision means the rule will not take effect while the court hears arguments in the administrations appeal and eventually issues a final decision.This comes as the Transportation Security Administration admitted to allowing more than 1,000 illegal migrants to use Department of Homeland Security documents to board domestic flights. During a Senate hearing Thursday, officials from the TSA said they allowed migrants to present items like arrest warrants and deportation notices as a form of identification at its checkpoints. They also admitted to using Border Patrol databases to verify the legitimacy of the documents.Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) commented on this revelation.“Under your tenureship the time’s for screening have gone up, up, up at airports all across the country, including in my home state of Missouri,” stated the lawmaker. “St. Louis is not the sixth longest screening process in the country despite the size of our airport there. People who have done absolutely nothing wrong, who are law-abiding citizens and in every respect are subject to the most invasive screenings at these airports. Yet, you are allowing illegal aliens to present warrant for arrest and waiving them on the airplanes. How does that make sense?”﻿Meanwhile, 10 Republican senators have sent a letter to the DHS demanding an explanation over the policy.","FILE – The Supreme Court is seen at sundown in Washington, on Nov. 6, 2020.

Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) took no position on the bill.NEW:The House passes the Right to Contraception Act by a vote of 228-195, two members voting present— Stephanie Myers (@_StephanieMyers) July 21, 2022The measure aims to protect a person’s ability to access contraceptives and engage in contraception and also protects healthcare providers. This comes after the Supreme Courts’ Roe v. Wade reversal and Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should revisit other decisions such as Griswold vs. Connecticut, which allows access to contraception.“The Supreme Court’s decision was a direct attack on abortion and Americans are now justifiably scared about the future of birth control,” stated Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.). “Republicans across this country will continue their extreme assault on basic freedoms and Justice Thomas made it clear that the Supreme Court will do nothing to protect our fundamental rights from these coordinated attacks.”Republicans, on the other hand, said the push from Democrats is unnecessary. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said contraception likely needs protection from Congress rather than by Congress, adding “if there is any entity you don’t want involved” in contraception choices “it’s the federal government.”Others claim it’s just another pointless bill to entice fear and rile up voters before the midterms. Meanwhile, Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) said it could be dangerous.“The kindest thing I can say about this legislation is that it is duplicative and unnecessary,” he stated. “But unfortunately, it can also be damaging. Contraception is so broadly defined that it could guarantee access to medical abortion pills or even contraceptives that might not have FDA approval.”This came shortly after the House passed a bill codifying gay marriage nationwide. It’s unclear whether both legislations will make it to President Joe Biden’s desk.","Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., makes a point during an event with Democratic women House members and advocates for reproductive freedom ahead of the vote on the Right to Contraception Act, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, July 20, 2022.

Local authorities said two Bahamian men were taken into custody over the suspected smuggling operation. This comes a few days after the US Coast Guard and Miami-Dade authorities intercepted a sailboat carrying more than 150 Haitian migrants. Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said his government has always warned against dangerous voyages and that they have increased surveillance on land and sea and intensified patrols.“Law enforcement officials will update you on the criminal matter as well as other rescue and recovery efforts,” said Davis. “However, I would like to convey the condolences of my government and the people of The Bahamas to the families of those who lost their lives in this tragedy.” Two Bahamian men were among the survivors and have been questioned in police custody. The men were known to police “for various offenses,” he said. Immigration Minister Keith Bell said 20 people had been taken to a detention center and were being interviewed.“We take this opportunity to strongly condemn the organization of smuggling operations which risk human life and compromise our national security,” the prime minister voiced. “Those found to be involved will face prosecution. I understand the situation that many of these migrants face that would encourage them to take such great risk.

Aungst was expected to serve prison time, but an exact amount had not been set yet. He faced a maximum of six months.“A loyal and dedicated man, Mark showed tremendous pride for God and his country,” read Aungst’s obituary on NorthcentralPA.com. “Above all else, Mark loved his daughter and any time they spent together, as she was truly his world.”Breaking: January 6 political prisoner Mark R.

After Trump’s speech they marched to the Capitol.Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst said video evidence showed the pair entering the Capitol through the Senate fire door at approximately 2:45 p.m. and leaving 30 seconds later. They re-entered the building through another door and took photos and videos inside on their cellphones.Aungst is not the first defendant to take their own life after being charged for being in Washington that day. Earlier this year, another Pennsylvania man arrested in connection with the January 6 riots committed suicide. Matthew Perna, who had also gone to Washington to support Trump pleaded guilty in December of 2021 to entering the building and faced years in prison. He hung himself in his garage.“He attended the rally on Jan. 6, 2021 to peacefully stand up for his beliefs,” said Perna’s family. “After learning that the FBI was looking for him, he immediately turned himself in. He didn’t break, touch, or steal anything. He did not harm anyone. He stayed within the velvet ropes taking pictures. For this act he has been persecuted by many members of his community, friends, relatives, and people who had never met him. Many people were quietly supportive and Matt was truly grateful for them.”He is survived by his mother, daughter and three siblings.","protesters participate in a political rally on July 25, 2021 in New York City.

(Franck Robichon/Pool Photo via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:08 PM PT – Saturday, July 23, 2022The assassin of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is undergoing mental health evaluations as authorities try to find a motive to the killing. Abe, 67, was pronounced dead by doctors at the Nara Medical University Hospital at 5:03 p.m local time on Friday, just over five hours after being shot while delivering a campaign speech in front of a small crowd on a street.The Nara District Court approved a psychiatric evaluation for Tetsuya Yamagami on Saturday to comprehend his mental state at the time of the murder. The results of the examination will determine Yamagami’s criminal responsibility. Yamagami has expressed animosity towards a religious group known as the Unification Church of which he believed the former prime minister to be a member of.“I thought that former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi contributed to the expansion of the group and I thought about killing his grandson, former Prime Minister Abe,” Yamagami told investigators.NHK and Kyodo News Agency have also reported that Yamagami said his mother was involved with the group. The suspect’s mother was a member of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, widely known as the Unification Church, said the church’s Japan office chairman Tomihiro Tanaka in a statement on Monday.The suspect was never a member of the church, while his mother has been a member who attended church events about once a month, the statement said. Tanaka added that the organization will cooperate with investigators if asked to do so.Abe is reportedly set to receive a state funeral on September 27.","FILE – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reacts during a press conference at the prime minister official residence in Tokyo on Aug. 28, 2020.

That’s according to a letter from Biden’s physician on Saturday, which said his primary symptoms “though less troublesome” include sore throat, runny nose, loose cough and body aches.Doctor Kevin O’Connor said Biden is likely infected with the BA.5 Omicron variant and completed his second full day of Paxlovid treatment. The doctor noted that he’s experiencing no shortness of breath, but uses an inhaler as needed for cough.Biden posted an image of himself working from the Oval Office in an effort to relay the message that he’s “doing great” and “keeping busy” after the positive COVID-19 test. The President later posted a video in which he told the country he’s doing just fine.President Biden continued working from the White House this morning, including speaking by phone with his national security team. pic.twitter.com/jdQkoDtupR— The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 22, 2022An update from me: pic.twitter.com/L2oCR0uUTu— President Biden (@POTUS) July 21, 2022Just a year ago, Biden went on CNN to misguide the American people by telling them they will not get COVID-19 if they get vaccinated. His current diagnosis seemingly debunks his previous claim, which further calls into question the administration’s hardline stance and continuous push for coronavirus vaccines as well as boosters.It was one year ago today that Biden said this quote: ""You're not going to get covid if you have these vaccinations.""Today, Biden tested positive for covid. pic.twitter.com/Q1BcBQaEXH— Greg Price (@greg_price11) July 21, 2022The 45th President wished Biden well after his diagnosis was announced. In a statement Thursday, Donald Trump said he hopes Biden will be able to recover quickly, just like he did back in 2020. The former President then pointed out Biden apparently fell sick with COVID-19 despite being repeatedly vaccinated and boosted. Trump stressed Biden must recover because no one wants Kamala Harris to become the president.(Statement by Donald Trump)In recent weeks, concerns have been raised over Biden’s fitness for office. The Republican National Committee has pointed to multiple gaffes suggesting his mental condition may be getting worse. Time will tell whether or not this bout with COVID-19 will add to his already concerning behavior. Meanwhile, the White House said he’s able to perform the full duties of office during this time.Biden tested positive on Thursday and will likely return to the White House Tuesday if he tests negative.","President Joe Biden gestures, during the G7 leaders’ summit at Castle Elmau in Kruen, near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Monday, June 27, 2022.
