2022-09-12,10:30 AM PT,US completes 1 millionth organ transplant,"The US surpasses another medical milestone as doctors performed the one-millionth organ transplant. According to data from the Mayo Clinic, surgeons conducted the one-millionth organ transplant Friday afternoon, just decades after the first successful kidney transplant in 1954.Reports indicate more than 41,000 transplants were performed in 2021, which is the highest on record. Officials say there’s a need for more organ donations as nearly 107,000 people remain on the wait list.“The difficulty with organ transplantation is we don’t have enough organs,” explained Dr. William Payne, Medical Director at LifeSource. “There are some people who wait until they die. They wait years and years and it never comes. It’s just life-saving. One donor can save eight lives with just choosing to give that gift of life at the end.”Today the U.S. has reached the milestone of 1 million organ transplants!

(AP Photo)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:20 AM PT – Monday, September 12, 2022Mainstream media claims the recent retreat in gas prices may be helping Democrats in midterm elections. The national average gas price fell to $3.74 last week from more than $5 per gallon in the beginning of the Summer.As a result, Democrats are trying to tout this retreat as President Joe Biden’s achievement on the campaign trail. However, US gas prices are still up 60 cents per gallon from a year ago, while the US National Petroleum Reserve has fallen to its lowest level since 1985. Additionally, economists have warned energy prices could surge again this Winter.“There is ripple effects and as the European industry shuts down, a good part of their industry will shut down this winter,” said Christopher Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy. “That’s inflationary effects across the industry. As Russia plays politics with cutting back oil exports we can see oil prices double from where they are today.”The world is in the worst energy crisis in 50 years due to natural gas shortages, and yet President Biden has reduced the amount of federal land available for oil and gas production by an astonishing 98% since Obama and 97% since Trump. No president has leased less since WWII. pic.twitter.com/PWvaWTHE0o— Michael Shellenberger (@ShellenbergerMD) September 6, 2022The Biden administration plans to impose a “price cap” on Russian oil in December and Moscow said it will stop selling oil to countries that join that price cap.

Over 184 people, including 125 Service Members were killed at the Pentagon.When speaking at the ceremony, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks delivered an emotional speech about the events.“21 years, four flights, two towers, 184 loved ones who perished here at the Pentagon, including 125 service members and civilians in the building. 59 men, women and children aboard Flight 77 and, of course, nine and 11. These numbers will be forever fixed in the minds and hearts of everyone who raised their hands here today and those who didn’t,” Hicks said.The Deputy Defense Secretary also took time to praise the individuals who came back to work at the facility the day after the tragedy.“Because as we tell individual stories of 9/11, we also tell the story of the Pentagon itself, of this building and this community, a story of resiliency and renewal, of a reconstruction project born out of ashes, determined to rebuild stronger in the broken places, of a workforce ever committed to its duty that returned to the Pentagon on September 12th and every day since, dedicated to defending our nation,” she said.Hicks ended her speech by reminding everyone to continue honoring those who perished by sharing their stories and defending our country.“So on this 21st anniversary of a day that shattered many and shaped many more, let us honor those we lost, those who helped us recover, and those who carry our spirit forward,” Hicks announced. “Like December 7th, November 22nd, September 11th is one of those days that anyone old enough to remember knows where they were and what they were doing.

Touts arms sales to Ukraine, vows to continue aidPresident Joe Biden speaks at a Democratic National Committee event at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, Thursday, Sept. 8, 2022, in Oxon Hill, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:02 PM PT – Saturday, September 10, 2022The Biden administration has vowed to continue selling arms to the Ukraine despite claims saying the US is trying to prolong the crisis in the country. The military industrial complex confirmed it will continue sending weapons to Ukraine for “as long as it takes” amid its war with Russia.While speaking in the Czech Republic on Friday, Defense Department Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Biden administration’s military aid packages to Ukraine have worked to stop Russia from swiftly taking over the west-aligned country.A day well spent with Czech leaders; Defense Minister @jana_cernochova, Prime Minister @P_Fiala, and President @HradOfficialENG in Prague to affirm our strong defense ties and commitment to @NATO’s deterrence and defense in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/IfKR4TjPPM— Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III (@SecDef) September 9, 2022Secretary Austin also touted that the Pentagon is sending over a slew of weapon systems in order to give troops on the ground the option to mix and match them in their offensives against Russian soldiers.“So, we see success in Kherson now,” Austin said. “We see some success in in Kharkiv. And so that’s very, very encouraging. But it’s not just about one particular weapon or weapon system. That is about how you integrate these systems and how you integrate the efforts of various elements in the inventory to create effects that provide advantage to the Ukrainians. We’re beginning to see that. And so, I think, I think they have they have great capability. They’re using it the right way. We’ll stay engaged and make sure that we’re giving them what they what they need to be successful. Thanks.”Meanwhile at the United Nations, America’s Deputy Ambassador to the International Organization Richard Mills, defended the billions-of-dollars in military aid sent to Ukraine. He fired back against Russia’s Ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, who claimed that America and its western allies are trying to perpetuate the conflict. Nebenzya also claimed that the United States is trying to achieve their longstanding goal to rid the world of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Mills and the UK’s UN Ambassador went on to decry Russia’s military operation as a violation of the charter. They also announced that they are not going to hide their support for the weaker Ukraine. However, Russia’s Ambassador warned that western weapons going to other countries always ends in unnecessary bloodshed.“A significant proportion of these weapons finds itself in the hands of smugglers right from the warehouses,” Nebenzya said. In the darknet you can find all kinds of offers to buy this weapon. We’ve already seen similar situations in the Balkans and the Middle East where Western military arsenals were then re-exported to Europe and then used by criminal groups on European territory or found their way into the hands of terrorists.”In the meantime, it doesn’t appear that the Biden administration is slowing down their arms sales to Ukraine. Biden recently approved a DOD request to supply $675 million worth of weapons to the country. Bill LaPlante, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment added that the administration is looking to continue filling billions-of-dollars’ worth of orders in the months to come.“To date, approximately 1.2 billion is already on contract,” LaPlante announced. “Of the 4.8 billion committed through USAI and then for replenishment, an additional 1.2 billion is on contract of the over 7 billion that is notified to Congress excuse me, throughout the remainder of the month, we expect to announce several additional awards. We remain committed to getting things on contract as quickly as possible. Ultimately, to send a clear and persistent demand signal to our partners in industry.”Meanwhile, foreign policy experts, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, warned that Ukraine’s demands for peace are unreasonable and that America’s encouragement of their operations could lead to a prolonged time of suffering for both sides of the conflict. Kissinger also warned that America’s foreign policy now looks like it’s made without reason or strategy. He added that continuing on this path could lead to major conflicts with superpowers such as Russia and China.","President Joe Biden speaks at a Democratic National Committee event at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, Thursday, Sept. 8, 2022, in Oxon Hill, Md.

The Democrat added that the current Court is a different Court than one served by Justices Earl Warren, Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O’Connor.“I think this is an activist Court,” Harris said. “We had an established right for almost half a century, which is the right of women to make decisions about their own body as an extension of what we have decided to be, the privacy rights to which all people are entitled. And this Court took that constitutional right away, and we are suffering as a nation because of it.”The Biden administration has been openly looking to circumvent the Supreme Court’s decision.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:22 PM PT – Friday, September 9, 2022Once again, the Biden administration is trying to gaslight the American people into thinking their policies have improved America’s economy. The administration is touting their so-called Economic Blueprint. There, they claimed that the first two years of Biden’s term were two of the most productive in history.The White House released a 58-page document on Friday. The document boasted both job and wage gains. It also mentioned the ‘bold and decisive action’ from the administration that comes as the country continues to recover from losses caused by lockdowns. Biden also claimed on Twitter that his first two years in office have ‘spurred the strongest economic recovery in recent history’.My first two years in office spurred the strongest economic recovery in recent history. Today, I'm releasing my Economic Blueprint, a look at how our wins are rebuilding an economy that works for working families.https://t.co/eSlr3ymdo8It's long. So here are the big things:— President Biden (@POTUS) September 9, 2022The documents release comes after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke in Michigan on the current administration’s economic plan.“Our plan, powered by the Inflation Reduction Act, represents the largest investment in fighting climate change in our country’s history, and it will put us well on our way toward a future where we depend on the wind, the sun and other clean sources of energy,” Yellen said. “We will reduce ourselves from our current dependence on fossil fuels and the whims of autocrats like Putin.”Despite these claims, Americans continue to feel the effects of historic inflation. However, the Biden administration said it has accomplished the greatest economic achievements in decades.“The recent trifecta of legislation our administration has signed into law will strengthen the foundations of long-term growth at the core of our post-pandemic economy,” Yellen stated. “Our economy, continues to expand and is upgrading above levels that would have been predicted pre-pandemic. It’s fair to say by any traditional metric, we have experienced one of the quickest recoveries in our modern history.”The administration says their blueprint is built on five ideas they claim will help American workers.The first idea is to empower workers by expanding jobs and wages. The idea also plans on giving people the power to unionize. The second idea is to make and build in America by investing in infrastructure and innovation in so-called clean energy and buying in America. The third idea is to give families what they call breathing room by lowering costs and allowing greater access to prescription drugs as well as by creating more affordable healthcare and childcare. The next idea is increasing competitiveness in the American industry by opening up corporation control and raising up small businesses. The last idea is by rewarding working class Americans by reforming taxes to ensure that household tax on those making less than $400,000 a year are never raised.The document was released as Biden was headed to Ohio. He visited the Buckeye State to oversee the ground breaking of a new manufacturing facility for intel, something the administration attributes to the passage of the CHIPS Act earlier this year.In my State of the Union Address, I shared a story of a field of dreams in Ohio where our future will be built.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 5:40 PM PT – Monday, September 12, 2022A new poll has revealed the falling approval ratings of the federal judiciary system. According to the Axios-Ipsos poll on Monday, 35-percent of respondents agreed at some level that a president should be allowed to remove a federal judge if the judge makes a ruling that goes against national interests. However, the plurality of 43-percent said that the current separation of powers should remain in place.This poll comes amid outcry over the Dobbs Decision. The Dobbs Decision prompted the mainstream media and Democrat operatives to call for judicial reforms which critics say may undermine the Supreme Court. Kamala Harris claimed that the Dobbs decision led to ‘suffering.’“This Court took that constitutional right away,” Harris said. “And we are suffering as a nation because of it. That causes me great concern about the integrity of the Court overall.”In the meantime, other researchers are finding a huge gap in confidence in the US Judicial System, with Democrats echoing their leaders’ cries that the system is rigged against them. Federal agencies including the DHS are now warning that far left groups could use violence in response to court decisions they don’t agree with.","President Joe Biden listens as Ambassador Caroline Kennedy speaks before Biden about the cancer moonshot initiative at the John F.

In an interview on Sunday, Warner said that the US has defeated terrorism but it is now facing a threat from what he calls ‘domestic extremists.’This comes after the Biden DOJ and DHS came under fire by Republicans for allegedly targeting so-called right-wing extremists while ignoring threats posed by radical groups Antifa and BLM. Warner then went on to lash lump in those who questioned the 2020 elections with threats from Russia and China.“I think the threat of terror has diminished,” Warner said. “I think we still have new challenges in terms of nation-state challenges, Russia in longer-term, a technology competition with China. But I do worry about some of the activity in this country where the election deniers, the insurgency that took place on January 6th, that is something I hope we could see that same kind of unity of spirit.”Despite Warner’s claims of ‘defeating’ terror, the Islamic state recently attacked the Russian embassy in Kabul while Al-Qaeda is ramping up local efforts across Africa and Asia.","WASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 27: Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) smiles and raises his hands in response to shouted questions from reporters as he heads back to the Senate floor following a recess in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on January 27, 2020 in Washington, DC.

The Supreme Court was scheduled to hear Christie vs. NCAA on whether states can legalize sports betting. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:41 PM PT – Monday, September 12, 2022Former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie (R-N.J.) thinks that the DOJ could have success in its appeal for the 45th President Donald J. Trump’s request for a special master.Christie was critical of the former President on Sunday’s show of ABC’s This Week. There, he said that the DOJ had asked Trump for the documents that were found in his Florida home for 16 months. He claimed that the department “had no choice” in taking the unprecedented action of raiding his Mar-a-Lago home. However, Trump has pushed back on these claims by saying he was cooperative when needed.Christie claimed that only the current executive can assert executive privilege, giving the DOJ a good case for an appeal.“There’s only one executive who can assert the privilege and that’s the one who is the current executive- Joe Biden,” Christie said. “A previous executive can’t exert executive privilege when they’re not the executive no longer. Biden will not exert executive privilege over these documents. I think the idea that some of these documents are somehow attorney client privilege is gonna be a bit of a reach and I think they’re gonna have to show, in some respect they have a good faith basis to make that claim. So, I think that the DOJ has a pretty good chance on appeal.”Trump argued that the search warrant itself was over-broad. The judge ruled that he could be harmed by improper disclosure of the sensitive information seized.","WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 04: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie speaks to members of the media in front of the U.S. Supreme Court December 4, 2017 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:48 PM PT – Monday, September 12, 2022The State of Delaware’s primary election is shaping up to be largely a one-on-one race for its only House of Representatives seat. As the vote approaches, both the Democrat and Republican primaries for the State’s House seat have been cancelled due to only one candidate being put forth by each party.Democrat incumbent Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) was officially announced as the uncontested winner of her party’s primary once the deadline to file for a spot on the ballot passed on September 1. Rochester was first elected in 2016. During her time in office she has not been unseated. She continues to run following the larger Democrat party’s ideals.“These are things that are real and are affecting people every single day,” Rochester said. “And what we’re saying is we are not going to sit back and wait for something to miraculously happen to solve our issues.”The Inflation Reduction Act invests in our future by addressing some of the most pressing concerns of Delawareans – like lowering health care & energy costs. 📹: @47abc pic.twitter.com/npDxFpSKOW— Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (@RepLBR) August 22, 2022For the GOP, the party has pushed Lee Murphy forward as their candidate in the race by giving him their full support. Murphy also ran in the 2020 election with the support and endorsement of his party. His platform and message have stayed largely the same since then.“The radical left has weaponized crisis after crisis,” Lee said. “They’re trying to shut down our economy. They’re trying to take away our rights. They’re trying to divide us, but let me tell you one thing, they are going to fail.”This will be the second time that Rochester and Murphy will face off in an election. Both of them ran for the seat last cycle. In the meantime, the State’s ballots are filled with State and local primaries. Races for the 41 State House seats and 21 State Senate seats are being voted on in the upcoming election.","WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 17: People walk along the east front plaza of the US Capitol as night falls on December 17, 2019 in Washington, DC.
