9:51 AM PT",NYC Mayor Adams flip-flops on migrants flooding city,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams sounded the alarm on the surge of illegal aliens coming to the Big Apple. During a press conference Sunday, Adams warned the city about the massive influx.One of his campaign priorities was standing up for “undocumented New Yorkers” by making sure NYC remained a “sanctuary city.” He doubled down on that promise by informing residents that right now “this is an all hands on deck” moment.﻿Adams went on to say residents must all be on board after asking the administration for help last week while calling the migrants a “real burden on New Yorkers.” Border towns are familiar with NYC’s plight as more than 3 million migrants have surged into the country since Joe Biden took office.Adams pleaded with the White House to provide aid to help accommodate the more than 2,800 people who recently entered the city’s shelter system. The Mayor was quick to blame migrants sent by Texas and Arizona, but also acknowledged federal migrant flights have contributed to the total sum. Adams listed a number of services for migrants he would like to be financed by federal tax dollars.Meanwhile, the Mayor of Arizona’s border town of Yuma, Douglas Nicholls, spoke with One America’s Alicia Summers to share his thoughts on the ongoing crisis.While Democrats continue to say Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s plan to bus illegal aliens from his state to Washington D.C. is purely political, proponents of the strategy have said it’s acting as intended. It grabs the attention of those who are seemingly blind to the events at the border.","FILE – Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden, on July 1, 2022, in New York.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:51 AM PT – Tuesday, July 26, 2022White House Chief Medical Adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci is recommending Americans get another booster shot for the latest variant of COVID-19. In an exclusive with The Hill on Monday, he said getting the jab is hi “best guess” at beating the new variant.His comments come as the BA.5 is the most widespread variant currently causing infections. In the meantime, Dr. Fauci claimed the FDA will likely approve booster shots for this new variant by the fall. This comes despite studies showing natural immunity is longer lasting than vaccine immunity.“There’s always the possibility that you’re going to have the evolution of another variant and hopefully if that occurs it will vary off from the BA.5 only slightly in the sense of being a sub-sub-lineage of it and not something entirely different,” said Dr. Fauci.The NIAID director has continued to defend COVID-19 vaccine mandates. He was asked why vaccines are still mandated in many places when he himself was quoted as saying that everyone would come into contact with COVID and most would contract it anyway. Dr. Fauci said vaccines, particularly boosters, prevent progression of the disease to hospitalization as the reason for the continued push.Dr. Fauci, who tested positive for the virus twice, also praised his Paxlovid regimen as he said it gave him a relatively mild disease. Meanwhile, the President’s physician said Joe Biden’s COVID symptoms are almost completely resolved. Dr. Kevin O’Connor gave the update Monday in a letter to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.President Trump gets #COVID:“It’s the end of the world!” Fauci and Biden get COVID:“No big deal.”— Rep.

A 37-year-old woman fired several gunshots, apparently at the ceiling, inside of Dallas’ Love Field Airport on Monday before an officer shot and wounded her, authorities said. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:10 PM PT – Monday, July 25, 2022Authorities are investigating a shooting which prompted evacuations at Dallas Love Field Airport. The FAA ordered a ground stop at the airport shortly after 11 a.m. local time due to the active shooter situation. Dallas Chief of Police Eddie Garcia said 37-year-old Portia Odufuwa began firing a handgun and a police officer engaged the suspect. He claimed that the woman entered the airport and went into a restroom to change clothes. Garcia expressed that the woman exited the restroom wearing a hoody and opened fire. Most of the shots appeared to be directed toward the ceiling.“At this point, we don’t know where exactly the individual was aiming,” Garcia stated. “From what we are seeing she was aiming at the ceiling. There are several rounds that were found.”An officer working inside confronted Odufuwa and shot her in her lower extremities. The suspect was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in an unknown condition. No further information about her or the motivation behind the shooting or who dropped her off at the airport has been confirmed by police. There were no other injuries.The investigation is ongoing and Garcia said he expected elements to change as more is learned about what happened. Dallas Police said they do not plan to release any other statements until Tuesday afternoon. The Dallas FBI and ATF are assisting Dallas Police in the investigation.The shooting wasn’t the first violent incident at the airport. In 2016, a police officer shot and wounded a man outside of Love Field after police said he advanced toward the officer with large landscaping rocks in his hands after battering his ex-girlfriend’s car with a traffic cone and rocks as she dropped him off at the airport.“I’m thankful to the Dallas Police Department, the Transportation Security Administration and the dedicated Love Field staff for their swift response in keeping people safe,” City Council member Jesse Moreno voiced. “This is something they do every day for people who travel to and from Dallas.”Earlier I spoke with an eye witness who described what he and his wife saw inside at the ticketing counter.

As a result, the US national debt surged above $30 trillion.“I think there is a very high likelihood of recession when we’ve been in this kind of situation before,” he stated. “Recession has essentially always followed when inflation has been high and unemployment has been low.”Summers said the US economy may face high inflation and no growth for a while.  The US government is set to release second quarter GDP figures later this week and if it is negative that would mean the country is officially in a recession.","Brian Deese, Assistant to the President and Director of the National Economic Council, speaks during a meeting where President Joe Biden appeared virtually with his economic team in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Friday, July 22, 2022.

(Ting Shen/Pool Photo via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:24 AM PT – Monday, July 25, 2022Forty-seven House Republicans joined every Democrat in backing codification of same-sex marriage, in turn, sending the bill to the Senate. Now in the upper chamber, the bill, which would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, codify interracial marriage and give legislative backing to the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision, could face an uphill battle to the 60 votes needed for passage.All 50 Democrats have announced their support for gay marriage with the onus falling squarely on 10 Republican senators to join them and send the bill to President Joe Biden’s desk. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has led Republican efforts to codify gay marriage while working closely with the Senates first openly lesbian member, Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, to try and secure the 10 GOP votes. Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Ohio’s Rob Portman and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis have also announced their support.If you are a Senator who supports marriage equality then you will support our bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act to protect this freedom and right for same-sex and interracial marriages. Let's stand together and protect the progress we have made.— Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) July 20, 2022However, even staunch conservatives are getting on board with the bill as Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson has announced his intention to vote ‘yes.’ He said that while he thinks the bill is unnecessary because overturning gay marriage would disrupt people’s lives in a way overturning abortion did not, he wouldn’t oppose its passage.“Unlike Roe v. Wade, this pretty well is settled law from the standpoint that people have relied on that and if you overturn it, that’s a big part of Stare Decisis, it would disrupt a lot of people’s lives,” Johnson stated. “Roe v. Wade was about affecting people in the future…as I look at that piece of legislation from the House right now, I don’t see any reason why I should oppose it.”Despite this, opposition still runs steep among some parts of the Senate Republican caucus. South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham has said that he would continue to support the Defense of Marriage Act passed in 1996 with majority support among both parties in both chambers and signed by Democrat President Bill Clinton.The Republican Whip in the Senate, Texas’ John Cornyn, who’s fresh off writing the latest anti-Second Amendment legislation with Democrats, has said he feels the issue is an unnecessary distraction because it’s already settled law.“I I think it’s a contrived issue because the Supreme Court’s decided the issue, so I don’t see any reason for the Congress to act,” he stated.Ted Cruz, Texas’ other Republican senator, along with a few others are also expected to vote ‘no.’ The rest of the caucus remains cagey about giving a direct answer on where they sit. Iowa’s Joni Ernst has said she needs time to review the legislation and Utah’s Mitt Romney believes the bill is unnecessary, but is looking into it.Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy didn’t say if he would support the bill, but did tell reporters he was amazed they fall for distractions by the Democrats listed off a litany of pressing issues facing the country from a wide open border to record inflation. He said the whole thing was to shift the media’s attention from those issues.With most Republicans not giving a firm answer one way or the other, it could be a bill with an unknown status until it comes to the floor for a full vote by the body. If it passes, Biden has said he will sign it the moment it gets to his desk. However, even if the bill fails, same sex marriage will still be the law of the land for the foreseeable future with Republican legislators and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh asserting the Obergefell decision isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.","FILE – Sen.

Speaking to Meet the Press on Sunday, the Virginian said she has become good friends with the Wyoming Rep. since working together on Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) January 6 committee. According to Luria, even if Cheney loses her primary her voice is vital for the future of the GOP.“I admire Liz Cheney,” Luria said. “I have been friendly with her ever since I came to Congress, even before we served on this committee together. I think that if she doesn’t come through this primary, come back to Congress, there are so many things that she could do in the future for our country.”While Democrats promote Cheney, Republicans have repudiated the Rep. to the highest degree. The Wyoming Republican Party has formally censured her and no longer recognizes her as a member of the party.“Her voice is absolutely needed,” Luria added. “And I think she’s one of unfortunately, a very small number of people who need to be the face of the Republican Party in the future. I would love to get back to where we had two political parties that debate on issues and facts and not lies. I really hope that Liz Cheney will continue, but I don’t want to speculate.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:13 AM PT – Wednesday, July 27, 2022The Vice President continued her pro-abortion crusade in the Hoosier state on Tuesday. Kamala Harris highlighted the effects overturning Roe v. Wade has had on disabled Americans.She held the round table on the 32nd anniversary of the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. While celebrating the importance of the legislation, Harris warned the repeal of federal abortions could be a cause of concern for those with disabilities.“So, we have convened knowing that the ADA was signed into law to protect the rights of Americans with disabilities,” she stated. “And with the recent Dobbs decision by the United States Supreme Court, I have particular concerns about how that decision will uniquely impact Americans with disabilities.”President Joe Biden’s border czar went on to chastise Republicans for passing pro-life laws, which she claimed disproportionately affects her audience.“But these abortion restrictions that are being put in place around our country by extremist, so-called leaders in various states, will have a disproportionate impact on people with disabilities,” Harris stated. “People with disabilities have higher rates of pregnancy complications.”Harris lamented those with intellectual or developmental disabilities are at a higher risk of missing the windows many states have set to receive the procedure. In order to ensure equitable access to abortions, she emphasized people with disabilities should be at the very center of discussions to resurrect Roe. Harris went on to declare abortion is integral to the very concept of freedom.“And Dobbs did so much that is going to undo the fair spirit of that principle, which is the spirit of all people have been entitled to self determination,” the Vice President continued.Unfortunately, the viral moment the event was Harris’ introduction as she began the meeting by announcing her pronouns. Several critics, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), expressed their shock that Harris would invoke the word woman as Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson said she could not define it.But what is a woman? https://t.co/nN6aIgJ2pf— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) July 26, 2022Furthermore, Rep.

(Department of Energy via AP)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:30 AM PT – Wednesday, July 27, 2022The Biden administration is releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) after a failed effort to increase supply from Saudi Arabia. In a statement Tuesday, the White House said the Department of Energy would sell another 20 million barrels of oil from the reserves to stabilize the gas market.President Joe Biden’s officials also pointed out gas prices have continued to fall. These sentiments came despite economists saying gas prices are falling because of concerns of recession, while most of SPR oil has been exported to Europe and China. This comes as natural gas prices in Europe are hitting new record highs as a result of anti-Russian sanctions.“The most crucial outcome is that we will start saving gas now and that we have a blueprint to act together in a coordinated way if the situation worsens,” said EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson. “Reducing gas demand proactively allows us to avoid rushed or unilateral decisions when it is too late. It will make it possible to plan the savings in the most efficient way.” 💠It is extremely important to explain our new “Save gas for a safe winter” package together with European Gas Demand Reduction Plan to the general public. 💠We need their support & everyone can do their part. pic.twitter.com/smIgsQuYey— Kadri Simson (@KadriSimson) July 21, 2022A number of European countries have already asked Biden for more oil and gas going into the winter season amid fears that Russia may shut off the supply.","An undated photo provided by the Department of Energy shows crude oil pipes at the Bryan Mound site near Freeport, Texas.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:04 AM PT – Wednesday, July 27, 2022President Joe Biden considers forgiving up to $10,000 of student loan debt as a ploy to appeal to young voters. The pandemic pause on student loan repayments will expire August 31 as the President attempts to extend the freeze until the end of 2022 or by next summer.The Education Department has told loan services not to reach out to borrowers, according to Student Loan Servicing Alliance Executive Director Scott Buchanan. The White House said no decision has been made.Critics worry this plan will fuel inflation and benefit rich students at the expense of lower income taxpayers. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates student loan forgiveness will cost the nation more than $370 billion.“So the President’s plan disproportionately would benefit people who are in the upper income group,” stated Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) while raising concerns over Biden’s proposal. “The top 40 percent of American households hold 60 percent of the student loans. The bottom 40 percent have less than 20 percent of the student loans.”﻿﻿Progressives argue $10,000 is not enough and are requesting up to $50,000 worth of debt per borrower to be forgiven.","FILE – American University student Magnolia Mead puts up posters near the White House promoting student loan debt forgiveness on April 29, 2022, in Washington.

Both the President and his aides insisted Monday that their administration does not believe the economy will hit a recession despite widespread inflation. Their dismissal came ahead of the GDP report to be released this week, which will show whether the US has experienced two consecutive quarters of shrinking.White House economic advisers have since tried to ignore the definition of recession, saying even if the advance GDP report comes back negative it’s “unlikely” the US is in recession.

International outrage over Myanmar’s execution of four political prisoners is intensifying with grassroots protests and strong condemnation from world governments. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:27 AM PT – Tuesday, July 26, 2022The Biden administration is looking to put pressure on Myanmar’s military junta. At a press briefing Monday, State Department spokesman Ned Price condemned Myanmar’s government, which has been run by it’s military since a coup in 2021, for executing four pro-democracy activists.Secretary of State Antony Blinken also issued a statement, calling the actions irreprehensible while claiming it adds to the killing of more than 2,100 residents and 700,000 people displaced from their home country. Both Blinken and Price warned this only shows how far Myanmar’s government is disregarding human rights.﻿Earlier in the day, the country announced its first set of executions in nearly 50 years. Among the dead include veteran activist Ko Jimmy and former lawmaker Phyo Zeya Thaw who were charged and convicted last month of violating counterterrorism laws.  The other two activists were reportedly convicted of killing a woman alleged to be an informant for the military. Some humanitarian organizations have claimed these trials were not conducted fairly.“The depravity of the Myanmar military junta knows no bounds,” stated Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. “These are four political prisoners, they were brought up in front of a military tribunal that was a closed trial. Crimes against humanity is obviously not enough for the Myanmar military junta: now they are engaged in executing prisoners.”Meanwhile, other activists on the ground are lamenting the military’s increasingly brazen attacks on its civilian population. Some believe troops’ attempts to take out opposition forces are just to cement their power and eliminate any threat to it. Others say these attempts will be counterproductive and will only rally civilians behind the pro-democracy movement.“There will be more resistance,  this will escalate the revolution, including the urban guerrilla fighters,” said Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a Myanmar activist. “There will be more defensive war in different areas. This action is just like a call to war, a call for war to their own people.”In the meantime, the US State Department is calling on Myanmar’s military to cease further plans to execute civilians and is urging the international community to sanction Myanmar. Cambodia’s prime minister, who chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has condemned Myanmar’s behavior and is looking to solve the political crisis in Myanmar at a regional level.","Myanmar nationals living in Thailand hold the pictures of deposed Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi as they protest outside Myanmar’s embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, Tuesday, July 26, 2022.
