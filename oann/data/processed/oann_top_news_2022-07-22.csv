6:59 AM PT",House begins debate on firearms ban,"The House Judiciary Committee kicked off the debate over which weapons American citizens are allowed to keep and own. During a hearing on Wednesday, House lawmakers went back and forth with each other over how to prevent future mass shootings.Democrat lawmakers such as Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) called for a ban on so-called assault weapons while claiming the ability to own them only results in more people being killed. This came after the CDC claimed that gun violence was the leading cause of death for children, despite many critics pointing out a flaw in their analysis. It appears they don’t discriminate between different age groups.“Imagine how much we could get accomplished if we clung to the desire to protect our children and communities as tightly as some of my colleagues cling to their rifles,” stated Cicilline. “There are more guns than people in this country, more mass shootings than days in the year. This is a uniquely American problem and assault weapons only magnify the epidemic.”However, GOP Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) pushed back on this claim by citing a 2019 statistic, which pointed to knives as the leading cause of most homicides with blunt objects such as clubs and hammers coming in second.“In 2019 there were 1,476 homicides by knife, there were 364 homicides by rifle,” he noted. “Blunt objects actually, clubs, hammers, etcetera accounted for more homicides than the rifles. Personal weapons, hands, fist, feet accounted for 600 homicides versus the 360 somewhat homicides by rifle.”👀👀👀 https://t.co/VgcaXzzS93— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) July 21, 2022Additionally, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) pushed further and argued an assault weapons ban would be ineffective at reducing violent crime. He pointed to a congressional study, which concluded that weapons prohibited under the 1994 assault weapons ban were used in only a small fraction of gun homicides.“Not only would this legislation strip Americans of their rights, but it would do nothing to make our community safer,” stated the Ohio lawmaker. “We know that because Democrats tried it before. They tried with the quote ‘assault weapons ban’ in 1994 and guess what? That ban was found to be ineffective in reducing violent crime. A congressionally-mandated study concluded that the banned guns were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders for the 1994 ban.”Democrats want to take your guns. Everyone's guns. pic.twitter.com/rQAUgFTjiQ— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) July 21, 2022In the meantime, the panel will continue to discuss a possible assault weapons ban for the House to vote on. Even if the bill passes in the lower chamber, it’s unlikely to survive a vote in the Senate.","Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee use charts to press their defense of the Second Amendment during a markup on the Assault Weapons Ban of 2021, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, July 20, 2022.

Investors added, big banks are already preparing for the worst.

According to Moody’s Analytics, 96 percent of America’s largest real estate markets are overvalued, which reduced housing affordability in recent years.Meanwhile, runaway inflation and shrinking household incomes are preventing Americans from buying homes. Economists have said the inflation crisis may cause a housing market crash, which could lead to a broader economic crisis.“As we’re seeing inflation on mortgage rates and interest, we are also seeing increases in construction costs that are really throwing the market off,” explained Jerry Howard, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. ” What I’m really worried about is historically housing has led us into every recession since World War II.”President Biden and the Fed’s inflation denial worsened inflation and pushed the economy into a recession.American families and workers are finding out that Biden’s economy is a cruel economy. pic.twitter.com/ynJB0SP3Yr— Ways and Means GOP (@WaysandMeansGOP) July 18, 2022Economists warn supply chain shortages, rising costs of construction and increasing costs of loans may all lead to a massive crisis in the housing market.","Plastic letters arranged to read “Inflation” are placed on U.S. Dollar banknote in this illustration taken, June 12, 2022.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:19 AM PT – Wednesday, July 20, 2022House Republicans are worried that President Joe Biden will further cripple the US economy and the well-being of Americans. This comes as the majority of voters disapprove of Biden’s handling of key issues. That’s according to GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) who made the comment during a press conference on Tuesday.“Seventy-three percent of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of inflation, 57 percent of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of energy, and 59 percent of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of the border crisis and illegal immigration,” she stated.Yet, she added, House Democrats reportedly want to discuss everything except the crises facing the country. This comes as House Democrats are working to pass a dozen spending bills through the House before the august recess.Additionally, Stefanik slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (R-Calif.) and House Democrats for putting their “socialist wish list” ahead of the challenges the nation is already facing. GOP members pointed out that their spending bills have more spending than usual.“Twenty percent increase for the EPA…30 percent increase for the Federal Trade Commission, 20 percent increase for OPM (Office of Personnel Management ) and 433 percent increase for election security grants,” explained Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.).However, the bottom line here, according to Republicans, is you cannot address inflation by increasing spending. While Republicans have said they want to work with Democrats to address these key issues, it seems as though Democrats want to govern the country alone resulting in the nation’s current economic state.“This is not a coincidence, this is what happens when one party Democrat rule fails America,” Stefanik asserted.House Republican Leadership Stakeout:﻿","Newly-elected House Republican Conference Chair Rep.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:25 AM PT – Wednesday, July 20, 2022Multi-billionaire Elon Musk may have been right about Twitter’s fake account problem. Bots may have influence on real world events from Hollywood to Capitol Hill and beyond.According to Rolling Stone magazine, the film “Justice League: Snyder Cut” got a major boost on social media due to activity by what appears to be inauthentic spam accounts. The report said Director Zack Snyder was actively pushing Warner Brothers for his version of the film to come to fruition as a legion of fans mobbed the studio to the same end on social media.However, the movement was not entirely organic as two reports from Warner Media found bots constituted 13 percent of accounts actively promoting the “Snyder Cut” across the Twitterverse. Although it was apparent Snyder’s fan base was largely human, bots were a contributing factor in pushing a studio to spend $100 million on a re-cut of a film that had bombed at the box office in 2017.Fake accounts also helped prop up the Biden-Harris presidential campaign’s presence on social media, according to a Newsweek report. Within two weeks of Biden selecting Harris to be his running mate in August of 2020, his follower count eclipsed 730,000. This was more than a 9 percent jump. Before November of that year, Biden was sitting at more than 11 million followers. Not only was the rise unusual, but a disproportionate number of accounts were linked to users in rural India.Furthermore, a Zenger News investigation found a large portion of new accounts inflating Biden’s social media presence during his candidacy were linked to troll farms based in India. Such entities manage multiple accounts and provide a number of analytics-skewing services such as increasing follower counts or flooding comments sections.All of this adds to the debate of bots on social media right after Musk terminated the deal to acquire Twitter. Musk said the number of bots on its platform is at least 20 percent while the company claims it’s only 5 percent, in turn, sparking a legal dispute.20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.This deal cannot move forward until he does.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022Although the the social media giant claims it has “bent over backwards” to be transparent, Musk is accusing the platform of not being upfront with crucial user data.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:07 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022New York City Mayor Eric Adams said migrants are becoming a “real burden” for the Big Apple. This week, Adams pleaded with the White House to provide aid to help accommodate the more than 2,800 people who recently entered the city’s shelter system.“This is a real burden on New Yorkers as we’re trying to do the right thing,” Adams said. “We already have an overburdened shelter system. So now we’re talking about food, clothing, school. This is going to impact our schools because we do not turn away individuals because they are undocumented. Translation services. There is just a whole host of things that this is going to produce. We need help.”Adams was quick to blame migrants sent by Texas and Arizona, but also acknowledged federal migrant flights have contributed to the total sum. The mayor listed a number of services for migrants he would like to be financed by federal tax dollars.“Currently, New York City is experiencing a marked increase in the number of asylum seekers who are arriving from Latin America and other regions,” he voiced. “In some instances, families are arriving on buses sent by the Texas and Arizona governments, while in other cases it appears that individuals are being sent by the federal government.”Adams asserted that asylum seekers have protected status and that while they’re residing in New York City his administration has the obligation to provide them resources.“If we do not get these urgently needed resources we may struggle to provide the proper level of support our clients deserve, while also facing challenges as we serve both a rapidly growing shelter population and new clients who are seeking asylum,” he stated. “We are calling on the federal government to partner with New York City as we help asylum seekers navigate this process and to provide financial and technical resources.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams: Influx of illegal aliens is “a real burden” on NYC resources. pic.twitter.com/5hc7x5YzQr— Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) July 20, 2022American border towns are familiar with New York’s plight as more than three million migrants have surged into the country since Joe Biden took office.","FILE – Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden, on July 1, 2022, in New York.

McConnell: Biden prefers dirty fuel from dictators over American energySenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, July 19, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:57 AM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022According to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), outrageous fuel prices are an argument against so-called green energy rather than a reason to transition to it. On Wednesday, the Republican stalwart decried Democrats for for domestic oil producers and exporters up to 60 percent. However, while Democrats are hindering American energy, McConnell claimed the only relief they have proposed to the American people has been made in China.“If you are not among the 75 percent of American who say inflation has caused you financial hardship and you happen to have a spare $80,000 laying around, Washington Democrats want to give you a green energy tax credit,” explained the Republican lawmaker. “If you buy an electric vehicle, maybe with Chinese supply chains. This is what Washington Democrats are trying to do with their one party government.”McConnell harkened back to the words of 2020 presidential candidate Biden who had promised to end fossil fuels. The Republican lamented Biden made good on those promises, promptly waging war on American oil, coal and jobs in the name of his climate crusade. Without an alternative fuel source already in place and Americans reeling from the White House’s separation from gas, McConnell noted that Biden has, indeed, sought to increase oil supply from other countries.McConnell struggled to find the green energy efficacy in Biden’s actions as the US producers extract oil and gas at a far more environmentally friendly way than foreign competitors. Furthermore, the Republican noted the countries the Biden administration is begging for oil from are morally abhorrent to American sensibilities. Despite these negatives, McConnell declared the real loser in this situation to be American people.“If the Biden administration really is serious about helping American consumers then they’ll stop waging war on American producers,” he stated. “If they are serious, they will call off Democrats’ plan to tax reliable American energy and to extension.

(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:13 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US needs to do a better job in approving arms sales to Taiwan. Esper made the remark on Thursday in Taiwan after recently meeting with Taiwan’s president and also said he would relay the island’s concern to Washington D.C. Taiwan has expressed frustration over the speed of weapons deliveries as China has ramped up military pressure on the island. Some of the weapons on Taiwan’s wish list are javelin-anti tank missiles and stinger anti-aircraft missiles.The missiles are in great demand in Ukraine where they have been keeping Russian aircraft at bay, but US supplies have shrunk and producing more of the anti-aircraft weapons has faced significant hurdles due to limited manufacturing capacity.Esper visited Taiwan under the auspices of the Atlantic Council think-tank where he had meetings with senior leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen. He said he did not get the sense Taiwanese officials were frustrated at what arms were on offer from Washington.“I didn’t pick up any frustration other than the speed at which we conduct arms sales,” he said.Great meetings yesterday in Taipei. Looking forward to today’s sessions with President Tsai, Defense Minister Chiu, and Foreign Minister Wu on how to strengthen US-Taiwan relations and readiness in face of growing PRC threats to our shared interests and free & open Indo-Pacific. https://t.co/bFrLpc9SRW— Dr. Mark T. Esper (@MarkTEsper) July 18, 2022The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but has also been prodding the government to focus more on asymmetric warfare. This is where a smaller force employs unconventional tactics against a larger enemy using more mobile weapons to make the island harder to attack, something Tsai has said she is prioritizing. Esper said Taiwan was never going to be able to match China in terms of conventional power and Taiwan should be studying how Ukraine has fought Russia using asymmetric strategies.Shortly after NATO officially named China an enemy target, its in-house think tank (Atlantic Council) just sent a delegation to Taiwan including former Defense Sec.

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:30 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022A House committee recently discussed the ethics of user data in the hands of government and Big Business. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) took his former colleague to task on Tuesday when he asked Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) about his current work as a lobbyist for Disney. The hearing focused on the consequences of corporations tracking and selling user data to governments or law enforcement. Gaetz said he was worried about private entities trying to “program” people and “make them think a certain way” by harmfully utilizing people’s data.“Like particularly with the Walt Disney corporation that it is in business with the Chinese Communist Party,” Gaetz said.Goodlatte said he did not know about the accusations Gaetz leveled and that he couldn’t comment on them. Gaetz went on to bring up a conversation that the pair had as members in the Capitol Hill Club, D.C.’s prime private hang-out spot for Republican lawmakers.“Chairman Goodlatte, do you remember a conversation you and I had?” Gaetz questioned. “When you led this committee at the Capitol Hill Club where you said, ‘The best way to be successful in the Judiciary Committee is to find interest groups that are opposed to one another and to tell both of them that you’ll support their positions, so they’ll both make donations?’”A man once said, “The best way to be successful in the Judiciary Committee is to find interest groups opposed to one another and tell them both you'll support their position so they'll both make donations.”That man was former GOP Chairman turned Disney lobbyist Bob Goodlatte 👇 pic.twitter.com/nyldqtgHhH— Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) July 20, 2022A class-action lawsuit was filed against The Walt Disney Company on Thursday, April 3 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit alleges that the embedded technology, known as “software development kits” were collecting data on children in secret to facilitate behavioral advertising or marketing analysis.“As a company long-engaged in the practice of engaging and profiting from children, Disney needs to make sure its games and apps comply with the law,” voiced Michael Sobol, an attorney filing on behalf of the plaintiffs. “They and the companies they work with always have to obtain verifiable parental consent before extracting kids data from their mobile devices when kids play Disney’s mobile apps.”Disney came under fire for violating the privacy of children and tracking their activities on Disney apps with the intent to sell the information. They are on a mission to use big data and machine learning to optimize their guests experience. The data industry that tracks and sells information on online activities will be worth $270 billion by 2026.","WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 09: Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) arrives for a House Armed Services Subcommittee hearing with members of the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee on Capitol Hill on December 9, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. (Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office via AP File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:56 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022A former Minneapolis police officer was sentenced for his role in the death of George Floyd. On Thursday, Thomas Lane was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison on a federal civil rights charge.“Mr. Lane this is a very serious offense, in which a life was lost,” U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson said. “The fact that you did not get up and remove Mr. Chauvin when Mr. Floyd became unconscious is a violation of the law.”Reports said Lane was sentenced for failing to intervene though his attorney argued he was the least responsible for Floyd’s death out of the four officers involved. This comes after former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin recently pleaded guilty to violating Floyd’s rights.“It’s insulting that he didn’t get the maximum amount of time,” voiced Philonise Floyd, one of Mr. Floyd’s brothers. “If it was me and that was accessory to murder, they would’ve gave me the maximum amount of time. You’re a police officer who was sworn to protect, who took an oath, and you didn’t get the maximum amount of time.”Magnuson also ordered Lane to be placed on supervised release for two years after he serves his time in prison, a public information officer told Reuters. Meanwhile, the two other police officers were also convicted of the same charges and will be sentenced at a later date.Former Minneapolis officer Thomas Lane's sentencing is over. We'll be back in court tomorrow for a hearing on Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng's, who are objecting to parts of their sentencing guidelines. (16)— Jon Collins (@JonSCollins) July 21, 2022During the trial, federal prosecutors argued that the three men knew from their training and from “basic human decency” that they had a duty to help Floyd as he begged for his life before falling limp beneath senior office Derek Chauvin’s knee. Earlier in July, Chauvin was sentenced to 21 years in prison on federal charges of violating Floyd’s civil rights.Lane faces a separate sentencing Sept. 21 in state court after changing his plea there to guilty for a reduced charge of aiding and abetting manslaughter.","FILE – This combination of photos provided by the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office in Minnesota on Wednesday, June 3, 2020, shows from left, former Minneapolis police Officers J.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:30 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022A new State Department report revealed just how insidious human trafficking has become in the US. While speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said over 25 million people are victims of human trafficking worldwide. This year’s report contained a massive amount of human trafficking stories from over 188 countries, including the United States.“The scale of this problem is vast,” Blinken said. “There are nearly 25 million people currently victims of trafficking. The United States is committed to fighting it because trafficking destabilizes societies, it undermines economies, it harms workers, it enriches those who exploit them, it undercuts legitimate business and most fundamentally because it is so profoundly wrong.”Today we released the 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report, which is meant to effect positive change and encourage governments to increase and improve their anti-trafficking efforts each year. Read it here: https://t.co/dRZXon7fRg #EndHumanTrafficking pic.twitter.com/AEhtoWyDAH— Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) July 19, 2022Additionally, 18 countries, including Russia and Vietnam, were placed on a blacklist for allegedly having non-existent or weak policies to combat traffickers. The report also noted that more than 21 countries have increased their efforts to address the global issue.“Twenty-one countries were upgraded a tier because those governments made significant increasing efforts to combat trafficking at home as well as for their citizens abroad,” he stated. “Eighteen countries were downgraded a tier indicating that they either didn’t make significant increasing efforts to combat trafficking or worse, that their governments have a state-sponsored policy or pattern of trafficking.”Meanwhile, anti-trafficking officials emphasized the need to engage with survivors early in an effort to draw more attention to the issue.“It is imperative that we engage survivors early and often,” voiced Dr. Kari Johnstone. “As we begin to see growing interest of our bilateral and multilateral partners to responsibly engage survivors, we are more hopeful than ever that elevated survivor voices will strengthen our anti-trafficking efforts around the globe. When governments and civil society prioritize partnerships with survivors, meaningful engagements can flourish and lead to better outcomes.”We are committed to working with governments around the world to improve our collective anti-trafficking efforts.

(NASA via AP).OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:43 AM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022The Chief of Space Operations of the US Space Force stressed the need for international norms regarding operations beyond our orbit. Gen. John Raymond spoke out on potential threats to the US in space from China. In a speech at the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday, Raymond said China is growing its space program at a fast pace and has the economy to continue doing so.“They’re building space capabilities for their own use,” Raymond said. “Just like we’ve enjoyed space capabilities that we’ve been able to integrate, China has built a space program to do the same thing. This provides them advantage and that provides risk to our forces.”Thanks to @AspenSecurity for hosting me today and @NPRKelly for the great dialogue! pic.twitter.com/xmWBXPcFD8— Gen. Jay Raymond (@SpaceForceCSO) July 20, 2022The general noted space operations are not new, but the area has exploded in recent years with few rules in place which made space more difficult to manage. He asserted that China is seeking to catch up to the US in space operations.“They have seen the advantages that space has provided us,” he stated. “We’ve integrated space, cyber and multi domain operations. To be honest they don’t like what they see.”When he discussed the international presence in space, Raymond also mentioned the issue of space debris causing congestion. He described how past anti-satellite missile testing by Russia resulted in the explosion of a satellite into more than 1,500 pieces and also touched on China’s 2005 test which created 3,000 pieces of debris.The thousands of satellite pieces create long-lasting debris in space which can harm existing satellites and be dangerous to astronauts. Raymond noted that the US has been trying to manage these sorts of situations and there have been discussions with the United Nations on how to regulate space to keep all parties safe.“This is something the US is leading on,” he voiced. “This is something we’re trying to establish the norms if you will, the rules of the road.”He also discussed the role that space could play in warfare which warned that future wars may take place in the domain as countries may try to jam communication or destroy other nations satellites. With the increasing ability of countries and private companies to send satellites into space, Raymond believes there could be much danger in space with no international jurisdiction.","This image provided by NASA, Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev perform maintenance on the International Space Station on Thursday, July 21, 2022.

(Lukas Barth/Pool Photo via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:12 PM PT – Thursday, July 21, 2022President Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID-19. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre released a statement Thursday, confirming his diagnosis and said Biden is experiencing mild symptoms.Jean-Pierre said the President is taking Paxlovid and will follow CDC isolation guidelines. He will reportedly work in isolation until he receives a negative test, which can be up to 90 days after a positive test. The positive test results come even after he has been vaccinated and received two booster shots.(Statement from the White House)Biden posted an image of himself working from the Oval Office in an effort to relay the message that he’s “doing great” and “keeping busy” after the positive COVID-19 test. The President later posted a video in which he told the country he’s doing just fine.An update from me: pic.twitter.com/L2oCR0uUTu— President Biden (@POTUS) July 21, 2022Just a year ago, Biden went on CNN to misguide the American people by telling them they will not get COVID-19 if they get vaccinated. His current diagnosis seemingly debunks his previous claim, which further calls into question the administration’s hardline stance and continuous push for coronavirus vaccines as well as boosters.It was one year ago today that Biden said this quote: ""You're not going to get covid if you have these vaccinations.""Today, Biden tested positive for covid. pic.twitter.com/Q1BcBQaEXH— Greg Price (@greg_price11) July 21, 2022The 45th President wished Biden well after his diagnosis was announced. In a statement Thursday, Donald Trump said he hopes Biden will be able to recover quickly, just like he did back in 2020. The former President then pointed out Biden apparently fell sick with COVID-19 despite being repeatedly vaccinated and boosted. Trump stressed Biden must recover because no one wants Kamala Harris to become the president.(Statement by Donald Trump)In recent weeks, concerns have been raised over Biden’s fitness for office. The Republican National Committee has pointed to multiple gaffes suggesting his mental condition may be getting worse. Time will tell whether or not this bout with COVID-19 will add to his already concerning behavior. Meanwhile, the White House said he’s able to perform the full duties of office during this time.","President Joe Biden gestures, during the G7 leaders’ summit at Castle Elmau in Kruen, near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Monday, June 27, 2022.
