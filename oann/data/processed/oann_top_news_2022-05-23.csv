(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Thursday, May 19, 2022Jean Baretto continues to fight for his life after sheriff’s tasered him at a gas pump nearly three months ago. On Wednesday, it was revealed that Baretto’s legal team has allegedly obtained surveillance footage from a WaWa gas station in Central Florida where the incident took place. The incident shows their client being tackled from behind by one deputy while another hits him with a taser.That taser shot ignited the fire ball that engulfed Barreto and two nearby deputy’s according to the State Fire Marshall. The family and attorney’s of the man say he never committed a crime.At the time of the incident Osceola Sheriff’s Department alleged that Barretto was part of motorcyclists that were harassing and pointing guns at other drivers. His lawyers claim the video shows the 26-year old was not trying to flee and question why an electrical charge would be deployed at someone dealing with a highly flammable liquid.“In Osceola County we have no tolerance for this type of behavior,” said Osceola Sheriff Marcos Lopez. “We will identify you and catch you, even if you flee into another county.”The Attorney’s have asked for a renewed investigation as the sheriff’s office has not released any additional information including body camera video. On Tuesday, he underwent his sixth surgery since the fire. Doctors say he still has a long road to recovery. His lawyers state that he has been fighting for his life for the past 80 days with third-degree burns over 75-percent of his body.“We’re calling today for FDLE to take this case over or to have the U.S. Justice Department take this case over,” declared the NeJame Law Group. “There’s too much going on, too many questions that need to be asked.”Jean Baretto still has not been arrested or charged with any crime.","Motorcycle enthusiasts attend the 81st annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally on August 8, 2021 in Sturgis, South Dakota.

(Joel Martinez/The Monitor via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:50 AM PT – Thursday, May 19, 2022Border Patrol agents in Arizona are preparing for the expiration of Title 42. Agents say they are experiencing a surge in migrant encounters near their checkpoint in Tucson. On Wednesday, they voiced that their encounters are vastly different from those reported in other border states such as Texas and California.Additionally, they’ve seen a 25-percent increase in 911 calls about illegal border crossings with authorities receiving up to 16 calls per day. Title 42 was put in place during the Trump administration and allowed border agents to turn away migrants attempting to cross into the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“Our numbers of apprehensions or encounters is more than 130,000 fiscal year to date,” said Border Agent Jesus Vasabilaso. “So our fiscal year started in October and then all the way to today. That’s up more than 50-percent compared to last year.”To combat this surge officials set up a working partnership with the Mexican National Guard to apprehend illegal migrants attempting to cross from both sides of the border.“We do what we call mirror patrol,” stated  Vasabilaso. We’ll patrol on our side, they’ll patrol on their side, so we’re both looking for any bad actors around the border. They’re looking for any ladders that smugglers will utilize to get people up and over the fence, they’re looking for people that are up to no good trying to assault migrants. If Title-42 goes away the border is not going to be open.”Title 42 is set to expire on May 23, but a federal judge in Louisiana is expected to hand down a ruling which could keep Title 42 in place.","Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas listens to Raul Ortiz, Chief, U.S. Border Patrol, as he tours the section of the border wall with Mexico, Tuesday, May 17, 2022, in La Joya, Texas.

(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3: 20 PM PT – Wednesday, May 18, 2022Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell (R-D.C.) doubled down on the policy of raising interest rates in coming months which may hurt millions of Americans. In an interview Tuesday, the fed chair admitted higher borrowing costs may cause some “pain” to households and businesses.However, he said it is necessary to curb runaway inflation and their is no way around it. Powell added that he originally hoped the federal reserve could stifle inflation without affecting the labor market but warns unemployment may rise slightly.“I would love to see a labor market that is more in balance, ideally that would start with the number of vacancies coming down,” said Powell. “Vacancies and quits are at an all time high, that suggests the labor market that’s out of balance. Their are more demands than their are workers. I’d love to see people come back into the labor force, We are seeing some of that now, we’d like to see that continue and we’d love to see the job vacancies come back so that your seeing supply and demand get back together”He went on to urge Americans not to worry about the labor market claiming the unemployment rate is now near a 50-year low. He further touted the structure of the U.S. economy saying he believes America will come out of the post-pandemic era strong despite the issues driving inflation. He vows to keep fighting inflation until it slows back down to two percent.“If that involves moving passed their wont be any hesitation about that,” he stated.Many economists criticized the fed chair for waiting too long before raising rates this year, but he believes his policies were “appropriate”. Some economists says riding fed rates may cause a recession in coming months.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Chairman predicts several shifts in the U.S economy that could slow down the rate of globalization.","Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill in Washington.

McConnell blames bad economy on Democrat policiesSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 17, 2022. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:15 AM PT – Wednesday, May 18, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) berated his Democrat colleagues for reckless spending while forcing the American people to foot the bill. While addressing the Senate floor Tuesday, the Kentuckian evoked the memory of economic prosperity under Republican leadership.“In early 2020, before the pandemic, Republicans helped create one of the best economic moments for working Americans literally in out lifetimes,” McConnell stated. “Unemployment was low, inflation was low and real take-home pat was rising steadily. In fact, we had wages rising faster for the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale than for the top 25 percent.”The Minority leader noted, the COVID pandemic caused an artificial speed bump for the American economy. He claimed the incoming Democrat government had been set up for success in January of last year as much of the private sector was reopening and COVID vaccines were readily available. However, the long serving senator lamented the political left snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and squandered the good position they had inherited.“But through their far-left policy choices, Washington Democrats have driven our economy right into the ground,” he asserted. “Inflation is setting 40-year records in consecutive months, gas and diesel prices have set new all-time highs on consecutive days, and sticker shock continues to cause headaches for Americans buying household essentials.”Gas prices are now the highest they have ever been in American history. Americans are now paying roughly $4.40 per gallon. That’s up about two whole dollars from when President Biden put his hand on the Bible.— Leader McConnell (@LeaderMcConnell) May 11, 2022McConnell recounted tales from around the country of people scrounging to support themselves amid steep price hikes. From taking out loans to afford food to visiting multiple stores for the lowest prices, the Republican highlighted the various ways Americans have grappled with the 10 percent rise in grocery costs in the past year. However, he accused Democrats of treating government spending as the only solution, which he said is exacerbating the problem.“Fewer than one-in-four American consumers say that this current economic conditions are even ‘somewhat good’ and fewer than one-in-five say the Biden administration’s policies haven’t done anything to help,” McConnell continued. “Democrats made runaway reckless spending their new normal here in Washington. So historic, painful inflation has become the new normal for working families everywhere else.”Despite chastising Democrats for excessive spending, the Minority Leader has been instrumental in drumming up Republican support to advance the $40 billion Ukraine bill in the Senate.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 17, 2022.
