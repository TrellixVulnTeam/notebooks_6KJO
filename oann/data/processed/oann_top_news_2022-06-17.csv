7:20 AM PT",Economists say Fed rate hike may be ‘too little too late’,"The US Central Bank has made yet another attempt to bring down record-high inflation, this time with the largest rate increase in 28 years. Fed chair Jerome Powell announced Wednesday that benchmark federal funds rate is going up by point 75 percent. This is an increase to a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. Powell acknowledged the economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years.“We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we’re moving expeditiously to do so,” stated the Fed chair. “We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.”This as comes inflation hit 8.6 percent in May, which is the highest level in more than 40 years. That same month, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.5 percent, which was the biggest single rate hike since 2000.The Feds just gave us the biggest interest rate hike in 25 years (0.75%) and told us to expect another 1.75% by the end of the year.Is this what ""Transitory"" inflation feels like, @POTUS?— Libertarian-In-Chief (@ToddHagopian) June 15, 2022Meanwhile, economists are worried the Fed may be doing too little too late. According to Guggenheim Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, the Fed is running out of time and an economic downturn may be just around the corner.“We saw those retail sales numbers come out, those were very weak numbers and there’s a chance that we are already in a recession,” he noted. “And so, if we are in a recession or we’re close to a recession and the Fed pushes on this more, and then we find that all of a sudden we have a decline is asset prices like stocks did in 87′ then if the Fed reverses course they are going to look like they are weak on inflation.”Similarly, Herbert Business School Economics Professor Michael Connolly pointed out that despite this major rate hike, the Fed is still “way behind what’s necessary” to slow inflation.“So the Fed’s action is not really a surprise, even though it seems dramatic,” he stated. “And it will help to accelerate the interest rate and treasuries, and that passes on of course to everything else with the expectation’s effect.”The Federal Reserve is expected to announce even more more hikes later this year, despite fears it may cause a recession. In the meantime, officials are trying to bring inflation down to 2 percent.Inflation is at a 40 year high!

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden is ready to use the Defense Production Act to boost America’s oil refinery capacity. Wednesday’s announcement came in unison with Biden firing off a letter to oil refining companies, demanding to know why they are not producing more fuel.“He’s open to all reasonable uses of federal government’s tools to increase output and lower cost at the pump, including emergency authorities like the Defense Production Act,” Jean-Pierre confirmed to reporters. The administration has claimed the lack of production is hurting its efforts to blunt the impact of the so-called “Putin price hike” at the pump. . In a letter to Exonn Mobil, Chevron and five other firms Wednesday, Biden said the companies must take immediate action to increase the gas and diesel supply. The President recently accused the oil companies of purposefully curbing supply to raise prices.“The letter is intended to solicit companies best ideas on how to increase capacity and how the government can help them do it in the spirit of honest and pragmatic dialogue,” Jean-Pierre continued. “But we feel this is a good step for us to move forward, and hopefully we’ll come and get some solutions.”Biden promised to end drilling & enacted policies to restrict oil. But now he mails a letter to oil firms complaining they're not drilling enough? This isn't just incoherence⁠—it's chaos.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) June 15, 2022America’s refining capacity peaked in April of 2020 at just under 19 million barrels a day.

Biden will make his first trip to the Middle East next month with visits to Israel, the West Bank and Saudi Arabia. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:24 PM PT – Wednesday, June 15, 2022President Joe Biden is causing yet another stir in Washington, D.C. with his latest foreign policy decision. On Tuesday, the White House announced Biden will be visiting Saudi Arabia in June, where he will reportedly meet with crowned Prince Mohammed bin Salman. GOP critics warn this is just another attempt to beg the Saudi government to produce more oil as the US faces a growing energy crisis.Previously, the Crown Prince refused to take Biden’s calls back in March and later humiliated his national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, when he tried to meet with Saudi officials to discuss oil exports. Biden even sent an arms package to the Saudi government, only to be snubbed in return. House Republicans claim the latest visit is a “Hail Mary” pass to simmer the skyrocketing gas prices.Why is Biden traveling 6500+ miles to discuss increasing oil production with the Saudis? He should be meeting with American producers in Texas, Oklahoma, and more states at home. We have the energy here!— Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) June 14, 2022Even Biden ally Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) expressed concern with Biden’s trip. While admitting the Biden administration is struggling to handle the energy crisis, Durbin couldn’t come around to agree that meeting with bin Salman is the right way to go. He cited the Saudi government’s numerous human rights abuses, including the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.“The Saudi Arabia record, particularly when it comes to Khashoggi, is an outrage,” Durbin stated. “It is the type of thing that clearly it was a designed murder and an effort to dispose of the corpse in a way that it could never be discovered. We now know what happened, at least to a large extent, and to say that that is just the ordinary course of business for a government is outrageous. So, I have mixed feelings on this and if the President called me, I would say, ‘Mr. President, you can’t trust these people.'”However, Biden’s State Department defended cozying up to the Saudi royal family. Spokesperson Ned Price stressed there are copious issues plaguing the Middle East that needs to be addressed, including Iran’s violent attacks in the region.Price also touted the Biden administration’s response to the Khashoggi killing, adding Biden remains committed to punishing those responsible for the attack. However, he failed to mention how meeting with the US President is holding bin Salman’s feet to the fire even as the Intelligence Community suggested the Saudi Crown Prince orchestrated the hit.In the meantime, Biden is set to meet with Saudi officials in mid-July at the end of a Middle East trip, where he will also meet with officials from the Israeli government and the Palestinian authority.FILE – In this photo released by Saudi Royal Palace, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, speaks during the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 14, 2021. After President Joe Biden took office, his administration made clear the president would avoid direct engagement with the country’s defacto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, after U.S. intelligence officials concluded that he likely approved the 2018 killing and dismemberment of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:02 AM PT – Wednesday, June 15, 2022President Joe Biden has continued to insist the economy is on the right track while economists warn of an impending recession. While speaking to union workers on Tuesday, Biden touted his economic performance despite record high inflation.“The bottom line is this; I truly believe we made extraordinary progress by laying a new foundation for our economy, which becomes clear once global inflation begins to recede,” claimed the President. “There’s so much at stake, but the truth is I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am today.”While Biden is more optimistic than ever, economist don’t share the rose-colored outlook. According to a recent Financial Times survey, nearly 70 percent of economists expects the US to spiral into a recession in 2023. Biden then went to say he will continue to rely on foreign markets to bring down the cost of fuel, which has reached a national average of $5 a gallon according to AAA.“So I have a plan to bring down the cost of gas and food,” said the President. “It’s going to take time, but let the world coordinate the largest release. What I’ll be able to do for the largest release of oil from the global fund in history. Million barrels a day and 240 million barrels to boost global supply. I convinced other nations to join us to keep prices from rise, keep prices from rising even more.”Biden is set to visit to Saudi Arabia later this year to speak with the country’s Crown Prince about possibly importing some of their oil. Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute has put out a 10 point proposal that promotes domestic oil production, which they asserted is a better solution to ease the pain at the pump.“This is America, we can do any damn thing we put our minds tom” Biden stated. “And guess what? We’re not going back to the false promises of trickle down economics. We’re going forward.”My Administration will continue to do everything we can to lower prices for the American people, but Congress has to act as well. pic.twitter.com/TPxSpOSnVa— President Biden (@POTUS) June 13, 2022Despite all the warnings from experts, Biden remains convinced the American economy is improving under his administration.

It’s hard to believe it ever went through user research.”However, the company struggled to find alternatives for words such as “shaman” and “manhandle.” The new feature was announced earlier in the year, with trial runs being met with universal negative reviews. This described the company’s attempt to be more inclusive as being overzealous.In leaked footage from an internal Google town hall meeting in 2016, the company’s top executives talked about using their technology to make advance progressive values, this just days after Donald Trump was elected.The company’s Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, tearfully pledged that the company would “use the great strength and resources we have to continue to push forward really important values” in the Trump era.Google has yet to respond to the leak.","FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured outside a Google office near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, California",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportTechnologyNews/tagreuters.com2022binary_LYNXNPEI360DQ-BASEIMAGE.jpg," Kavanaugh Murder Plot Ignored By Democrats, Liberal MediaTOPICS:GoogleleaknewwsOANOANNruth poratTown Halltrump-era SHARETWEETPINSHARE",https://www.oann.com/leaked-documents-show-google-struggling-to-curate/

This came as Committee Chairman Benny Thompson (D-Miss.) told reporters the panel sent a letter to Thomas requesting she testify before them.“We have sent Ms. Thomas a letter asking to come and talk to the committee,” Thompson said.NEW: Jan. 6 Select Committee Chair Bennie Thompson says they will request testimony from Ginni Thomas in light of the Eastman emails.“We think it’s time that we, at some point, invite her to come talk to the committee.”— Andrew Solender (@AndrewSolender) June 16, 2022The conservative activist is reportedly being targeted by the committee over text messages to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and alleged emails to Attorney John Eastman regarding the 2020 election.Thompson said the emails “might come up at some point” in their hearings, though they were still in the “discovery phase.” Eastman claimed he did not discuss matters before the Supreme Court with Ginni Thomas or her husband.“Whether or not those news accounts were true, I can categorically confirm that at no time did I discuss with Mrs. Thomas or Justice Thomas any matters pending or likely to come before the Court,” Eastman voiced. “The emails with Ginni Thomas were related to an invitation to give an update about election litigation to a group she met with periodically.”Thomas’s attempts to overturn the election results have drawn fierce criticism from Democrats. Her involvement in the efforts has raised ethical questions over her husband’s role in deciding cases related to the election and Jan. 6.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:01 AM PT – Thursday, June 16, 2022Moderna plans to study its COVID-19 vaccine in infants as young as 3-months-old. The biotech company announced Wednesday that it will enroll as many as 700 babies in their experiment, dubbed Baby Cove, in September. The babies will reportedly receive two doses of Moderna’s vaccine within an eight-week period.The announcement comes as the FDA declared Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines to be safe and effective for children 6-months to 6-years-old, which means this is one step closer to full FDA authorization. During a Wednesday hearing, an FDA committee unanimously endorsed both vaccines after a testimony from a panel of medical experts and representatives from both companies.“I do believe the benefits far outweigh the risks that were involved and personally, I really do believe this recommendation does fill a significant unmet need for a really ignored younger population in need of options,” said Dr. Michael Nelson, an FDA committee member. “Families will now have a choice that they did not have before, and I fully believe in the intelligence of families to make the right choice for their family and children.”The committee endorsed the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines while citing a recent report from the CDC, purportedly showing an increase in COVID deaths amongst infants and young children.“Unfortunately, infants and young children can and do die with COVID,” said Dr. Evan Anderson of the Emory School of Medicine. “As of June 2, more than 440 infants and young children aged zero through four have died with COVID as documented by CDC. This is a tremendous burden of disease.”The hearing ended with the committee expressing concerns about “vaccine hesitancy” due to reports about adverse side effects such as paralysis tied to COVID-19 vaccines. Other adverse symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, appendicitis and herpes.“I have a lot of concern that many of these kids will not get the third dose,” expressed Dr. Jeannette Lee, another FDA committee member. “As we know, it’s a struggle to get people in for two. We’ve already seen with the boosters for adults, lots of people don’t take them. And so my concern is that you have to give them three doses to really get what you need. I’m just concerned that that some won’t.”The decision is now in the hands of CDC advisers who will vote on Saturday whether to sign-off on authorizing both vaccines. If authorized, the vaccines could be made available for young children as soon as next week.","FILE – A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is displayed on a counter at a pharmacy in Portland, Ore. on Dec. 27, 2021.

6:50 PM PT","Kavanaugh murder plot ignored by Democrats, Liberal media","Kavanaugh murder plot ignored by Democrats, Liberal mediaAssociate Justice Brett Kavanaugh stands during a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, on April 23, 2021. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:50 PM PT – Thursday, June 16, 2022Democrats and the mainstream media appear to be downplaying the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (R). Apart from a White House statement condemning Kavanaugh’s assassination attempt in his Maryland home, President Biden has not spoken personally about the matter.This comes despite Biden making several public appearances to promote his agenda since the incident earlier this month. So far, Attorney General Merrick Garland has been the most prominent Biden administration official to personally address the assassination attempt on Kavanaugh.“This kind of behavior is obviously behavior that we will not tolerate,” Garland voiced. “Threats of violence and actual violence against the Justice is a strike at the heart of our Democracy. We will do everything we can to prevent them and to hold people who do them accountable. Last month, I accelerated the protection of all the Justice’s residences 24/7.”Mainstream media outlets also appear to be mostly avoiding the issue. On air, apart from the initial coverage of the incident, the murder attempt has been largely ignored by NBC and CNN among others. On print, it was shoved deep in the pages of the New York Times the day after the incident and not on the cover of a number of publications.The dismissal was noted by many of Kavanaugh’s neighbors whose community was recently swarmed by protesters angry over the possibility the conservative judge will be among those who could vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.“You don’t get to take away my bodily autonomy and enjoy your Saturday night at home,” a protestor stated. “You can do one or the other.”The Justice’s neighbors contend had the assassination attempt happened to a liberal federal official, the media would treat the threats more seriously.","Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh stands during a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, on April 23, 2021.

While speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the Texas lawmaker said they had to iron out a few issues before an agreement can be reached.Cornyn then pointed out two key issues: whether the federal government should be offering states financial incentives to implement red flag laws and closing the so-called “boyfriend loophole.” In the meantime, other GOP senators told One America News the “devil is in the details” and they remain cautious when it comes to supporting any potential bipartisan agreement on a so-called bipartisan gun safety measure.One America’s John Hines has more from Capitol Hill.","Sen.
