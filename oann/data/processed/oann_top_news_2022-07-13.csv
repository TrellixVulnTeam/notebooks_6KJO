11:37 AM PT",Poll: Majority of Democrats don’t want Biden to run for re-election in 2024,"According to a new poll, nearly two-thirds of Democrat voters do not want President Joe Biden to run for re-election in 2024. In the New York Times and Siena College survey released Monday, 64 percent of respondents said they would prefer the party have a new presidential nominee in 2024.Respondents cited Biden’s age and job performance as the top two reasons for wanting another nominee.The poll also notably found 94 percent of respondents under the age of 30 believe Democrats should nominate someone other than Biden who is the oldest president in US history. This comes as Biden continues to face tough criticism over his behavior, in turn, sparking new concerns about his mental fitness for office.Joe Biden reading off the teleprompter: ""…end of quote. Repeat the line.""This is getting embarrassing for our country. pic.twitter.com/SWh0cJqzOI— Brian Mast (@BrianMastFL) July 8, 2022In a Truth Social post on Sunday, 45th President Donald Trump noted there are a lot of people Biden’s age and older who are as good and sharp as ever. However, Trump said Biden is not one of them. Trump stressed that Biden’s cognitive and mental problems have nothing to do with his age and he quipped life doesn’t truly begin until 80.To add fuel to the fire, it appears Biden has become the most hated president in the past 75 years as America faces deepening economic and social crises. According to FiveThirtyEight polling Monday, Biden’s approval rating of 38 percent is the lowest among all presidents since 1945 except Harry Truman.Back in 1946, Truman’s rating was 33 percent. This can be compared to Trump’s rating of 42 percent at the same point in his presidency along with Richard Nixon’s rating of 54 percent and Dwight Eisenhower’s rating of 70 percent. The poll also shows Republican presidents fared better during their second year in office than their Democrat counterparts.","President Joe Biden speaks during an event to celebrate the passage of the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” a law meant to reduce gun violence, on the South Lawn of the White House, Monday, July 11, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Vice President Kamala Harris suggested American citizens should not have access to certain firearms and called for further restrictions. In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Harris was asked about the recent assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.“I was shocked for so many reasons,” Harris said. “Beginning with the fact that Prime Minister Abe was a great friend to the United States through many administrations. Our President Joe Biden is very, very fond of him and knew him well.”She offered condolences and addressed the troubling nature of his death, but did not comment on Japan’s strict gun laws. Instead she steered the conversation to the US and declared that no American would own a high powered rifle unless they had plans to murder people.“Assault weapons were specifically and intentionally designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly,” she stated. “It is a weapon of war. If you’ve ever looked at, if I may be so blunt, an autopsy photograph to see what it does to the human body. The fact that we can’t get Congress to renew.  It’s not like we’re pulling something out of our hat. We’ve done it before as a nation to renew the assault weapons ban, is outrageous.”We cannot allow our nation to live in fear of gun violence anymore. The Senate must pass commonsense gun laws and protect the people of this country. The time for change is now. pic.twitter.com/2K1Q0UyOfO— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 9, 2022The Democrat went on to suggest that if the weapons weren’t legally available mass shootings wouldn’t happen. Although Democrats control both chambers of Congress, any major gun reform legislation would require 60 votes in the Senate. That means that at least 10 Republicans would have to sign on to legislation for it to be viable.“We have to stop allowing those weapons to be available to civilians living in communities who have a right to believe that they are not in a war zone,” she voiced.The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is long overdue.This law will take reasonable steps to help prevent gun violence in America. And it will save lives.— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 11, 2022The Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, specifically outlawed 19 types of semi-automatic firearms, as well as other rifles, shotguns and handguns that possess two or more of a certain set of features. This included pistol grips, detachable magazines and sound suppressors. The maximum capacity of a magazine was also set at 10 rounds. The vice president went on to speak about her experience visiting Highland Park in Illinois where the tragic July 4 mass shooting took place.“You can support the Second Amendment, I support the Second Amendment,” she expressed. “But we should agree we should not have weapons of war on the streets of America. Sadly a toddler lost both his parents. When I got to the scene I was greeted by the mayor, the chief and the first responders who told me that story. I can’t even imagine what this is going to mean for the life of that child.”The call for common-sense gun violence legislation is long overdue. Today we celebrate the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. https://t.co/YhxKmfvBHX— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 11, 2022Harris said recent suspects have been able to slip past “red flag” laws simply because guns are available. She voiced that Congress must reinstate the so-called assault weapons ban of 1994.","Vice President Kamala Harris speaks as President Joe Biden looks on, during an event to celebrate the passage of the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” a law meant to reduce gun violence, on the South Lawn of the White House, Monday, July 11, 2022, in Washington.

Not only the right to choose by the way, but this justice was part of the process of stripping away the right to privacy.”Buttigieg said while he thinks public figures should be “free from violence, harassment and intimidation” no one should be free from criticism and peaceful protests.","FILE – Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg listens at an event in Philadelphia, on Jan. 14, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:58 AM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire said US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would have been fired if he were president for misleading Americans about inflation. During an interview Sunday, the Republican stressed a recession is, in fact, coming.“You cannot add $5 trillion onto America’s balance sheet and just hope it goes away,” he stated. “The recession is coming. The Fed, I think, has known this for a while. They have kind of ignored it. They should have been easing us into the right rates and where we need to go over a year ago.”Sununu asserted that Yellen completely misled the American people and didn’t want to “own the bad news.” He added, the Biden administration needs to stop telling Americans a recession isn’t inevitable.“You had a Treasury secretary who was saying, ‘oh well, it’s not inevitable.’ ​Of course, it’s inevitable,” he continued. “You don’t need four-years at Dartmouth economics to know that. When you add that $5 trillion, there has to be some outcome.”Notably, Sununu said low-income families and others on fixed incomes are going to suffer this coming winter with home heating costs expected to soar past record rates. He took to Twitter to note, “inflation is the worst tax on the poor that bad management can bring and that’s exactly what the Democrats in Washington have done.” Several other Republican lawmakers have echoed these sentiments.Joe Biden isn’t spending America to prosperity, he’s spending us into a recession.— Senator Michael Rulli (@michaelrulli) July 6, 2022Yellen previously shifted the responsibility of dealing with inflation away from the White House by claiming the Federal Reserve is responsible for dealing with the American economy. Prior to this, Yellen had suggested the Biden administration was running out of options to address its mishandling of the economy.","FILE – Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, on June 8, 2022.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 3:21 PM PT – Sunday, July 10, 2022The Los Angeles Department of Elections determined the petition to recall District Attorney George Gascon has enough signatures to trigger an election. In a press release Saturday, the voter registrar stated the raw count of recall petition signatures was 715,833. A total of 567,000 valid signatures are needed to trigger a recall which the department will verify by a random sample of the signatures turned in by petition organizers.“As authorized in the California Elections Code, the RR/CC will use the random sampling technique for the verification of petition signatures,” said Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan. “The random sample is 5 percent of the total number of signatures submitted. Based on the random sampling results the petition will be certified as sufficient, require verification of all signatures submitted, or certified as insufficient. If the petition meets the sufficiency requirement the RR/CC must certify sufficiency to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors at its next regular meeting.”The earliest a recall election could take place is November 8 in a general election that includes runoff races for Los Angeles city mayor and county sheriff, as well as congressional midterms. If it’s put to a vote more than 50 percent of voters would have to vote to oust Gascon.“The concept that these changes were made solely because of the outside pressures, I know it may appear to be that way, but I can tell you it’s much more nuanced than that,” voiced Gascon. “Frankly, regardless of where the recall goes, there will be additional adjustments.”BREAKING: Los Angeles Voter Registrar (Dept of Elections) has determined the raw count of recall petition signatures to be 715,833 , way above the threshold for recall. The Dept has til Aug 17 to now validate the signature sample to conclude that the recall tally has succeeded. pic.twitter.com/W3hwH7W3fC— Richie Greenberg (@richieSF2016) July 9, 2022Growing frustrations with Gascon have centered on his all or nothing policy stances. On his first day in office, Gascon barred prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, trying juveniles as adults and filing sentencing enhancements. This increased the amount of prison time a defendant will face in certain situations, including if they use a gun in the commission of a crime.An attempt to recall Gascon failed last year when the recall campaign was unable to garner enough signatures on a petition to put the issue to voters.","Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon in San Francisco, California.

The top Republican contended that Democrats are floating “ruinous policies” when the country is already on the brink of a recession.“Democrats created a runaway inflationary tax hike with their reckless spending last year, 2021, and now they want to come after the American people a second time with a huge, new tax hike,” he stated. “In other words, Democrats have already picked the American people’s pocket once and now their solution is to pick your pockets a second time. First, with inflation and now with tax hikes.”﻿McConnell also warned Democrats passing partisan tax hikes would “paralyze” the Senate putting bipartisan proposals on China and other issues in jeopardy.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022.

According to reports, the US official made a last minute stop in Tokyo and met with current Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to pay tribute to the late politician.Ahead of his trip, Blinken noted that the US Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and has never been stronger. This comes as Abe was assassinated by a gunman in broad daylight while he was giving a speech last week.“We saw in him something rare, a man of vision who had the ability to realize that vision,” Blinken stated. “But mostly, I came at the President’s behest because more than allies, we are friends. And when a friend is hurting, other friends show up.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:55 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Texas officials came to an agreement on releasing surveillance video from the Uvalde school shooting. On Monday, state and local agencies reached a compromise regarding the images from the May 24 mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers.“I can tell people all day long what it is I saw, the committee can tell people all day long what we saw, but it’s very different to see it for yourself,” Texas Rep. Dustin Burrows (R) stated.Law enforcement officers and the mayor of Uvalde have been arguing for weeks on how to handle the delicate matter. They ultimately agreed that some parts of the video should be available to the public.“This video would be of the hallway footage from Robb Elementary School,” he said. “It would contain no graphic images or depictions of violence. The video would begin after the shooter enters the room and end before a breach of that room, while giving stark insight into what officers did for more than an hour before confronting the gunman that day.”BREAKING REPORT: Uvalde mayor says he BACKS PLAN to release 77-minute hallway video showing how elementary school massacre unfolded while cops stood by and did nothing…— Chuck Callesto (@ChuckCallesto) July 9, 2022Questions still remain about the time officers arrived on the scene that fateful day and why they waited 77 minutes before breaching the classroom. Over the weekend, Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin accused Uvalde-area District Attorney Christina Busbee of misleading family members about McLaughlin’s support for releasing certain footage that showed the police response during the rampage.“We do not believe the video’s public release would harm our investigative efforts,” the Public Safety Department’s Deputy Director of Homeland Security Operations Martin Freeman wrote in a letter to Burrows. “In fact, releasing this video would assist us in providing as much transparency as possible to the public.”It’s 105 degrees in Uvalde and there hundreds of people marching. pic.twitter.com/nPPbbAbxIj— Jose Arredondo (@sportsguyjose) July 10, 2022Burrows has not said when the video would be released.","Family and friends of those killed and injured in the school shooting at Robb Elementary take part in a protest march and rally, Sunday, July 10, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:05 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022The ever-growing crisis at the southern borders reached new highs. A new Breitbart report showed Texas Border Patrol agents apprehended around 26,000 migrants in less than a week who crossed into border towns.The recent spike in arrests prompted Governor Greg Abbott (R-Texas) to sign an “invasion” executive order allowing the Texas National Guard and Texas DPS to send those migrants back to the border where they can return to Mexico. He and other GOP politicians have piled blame onto the Biden administration for failing to secure the southwestern border.“While President Biden refuses to do his job and enforce the immigration laws enacted by Congress, the State of Texas is once again stepping up and taking unprecedented action to protect Americans and secure our southern border,” said Abbott. “The cartels have become emboldened and enriched by President Biden’s open border policies, smuggling in record numbers of people, weapons, and deadly drugs like fentanyl.”The arrests took place in the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, Del Rio, Big Bend and El Paso sectors. According to Monday’s report, of the 26,000 migrants apprehended 10,000 were in the Texas border town of Eagle Pass. The Del Rio border sector saw the largest share with 12,000 migrants being apprehended by border agents there.“As the challenges on the border continue to increase, Texas will continue to take action and address those challenges,” he stated.I issued an Executive Order authorizing the Texas National Guard & Texas Dept. of Public Safety to return illegal immigrants to the border.Cartels have become emboldened by Biden's open border policies.Texas is taking unprecedented action to STOP this criminal enterprise. pic.twitter.com/ag08ACYP3Y— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) July 7, 2022In addition, 70 percent of the migrants apprehended in Texas were single adults.","FILE – A line of Texas Department of Safety vehicles line up on the Texas side of the Rio Grande with Mexico visible, right, near an encampment of migrants, many from Haiti, on Sept. 22, 2021, in Del Rio, Texas.
