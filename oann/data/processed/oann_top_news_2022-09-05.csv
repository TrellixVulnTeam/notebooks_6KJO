In turn, this would push prices even higher. This warning comes after Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Alexander Novak, said that Russia will not sell oil and gas to countries that join proposed price-caps. OIL MARKET: Ahead of the G7 meeting to discuss a Russian oil price cap on Friday, Alexander Novak says Moscow won’t supply crude and/or refined petroleum products to those companies and nations that introduce a price cap on Russian oil | #OOTT #EnergyCrisis— Javier Blas (@JavierBlas) September 1, 2022However, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed that a price cap would be ‘very effective.’“[The price cap] is the most effective way to hit hard at Putin’s revenue and doing so will result in not only the drop in [Russia’s] revenue but also global energy prices as well,” Jean-Pierre stated.Natural gas prices in the EU have skyrocketed amid anti-Russian sanctions.

Instead, Waltz lamented that the Biden administration has killed more civilians in Afghanistan than ISIS-K terrorists. Meanwhile, Democrat Representative and retired Marine Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), pointed out that Biden also betrayed his promise to help the Afghans who worked alongside American troops. The deal we made with our Afghan allies was that they could put their lives in our hands, that we would have their backs and get them out to safety if the time came.We have yet to live up to that promise. pic.twitter.com/NOeCC43AO9— Seth Moulton (@sethmoulton) September 2, 2022“Afghans, allies of ours, are stuck there (and) being hunted down by the Taliban as we speak,” Moulton stated.Both Representatives seem to agree that the aftermath of the withdrawal is a slap in the face to US Veterans, our allies and to the American people. ","KORENGAL VALLEY, AFGHANISTAN – OCTOBER 27: U.S. soldiers board an Army Chinook transport helicopter on October 27, 2008 in the Korengal Valley, Afghanistan.  (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-83448824.jpg, Newsom In-Laws Moved To Fla.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:17 PM PT – Saturday, September 3, 2022California is advising residents not to charge their electric vehicles. This request comes just days after the State passed legislation to phase out gas powered cars by 2035.This week, the Golden State’s grid operator asked motorists not to charge their vehicles during peak hours citing the scorching heat and high energy consumption. 40 percent of Americans electric vehicles are registered in California. This statistic has led critics to ask how so much electricity usage would be nationally feasible. However, Governor Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) said the answer to that question is more green energy investments.“We recognize that we needed to do more in terms of de-risking our transition to green energy,” Newsom said. “We are not doing anything except accelerating, I mentioned what we are doing on permitting and procurement, accelerating that transition to low carbon-renewable sources of energy.”Representative Steve Scalise (R-La.) took to Twitter. There, he referred to this request as the type of governance Democrats want nationwide.California is now telling people to “avoid using large appliances and charging electric vehicles” from 4-9pm.This from the same state that’s going to force everyone to buy electric cars by 2035.This is what Democrat control looks like—and they want it nationwide. What a joke. pic.twitter.com/8tS3KsQWqR— Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) August 31, 2022The State is currently getting scorched by a record-breaking heat-wave. It’s expected to be 10-to-20 degrees warmer than normal across the State throughout this Labor Day weekend, with temperatures reaching 115-degrees in the inland valleys and into the triple digits along the coast. The National Weather Service is calling it an extraordinary heat event. Although the sweltering temperatures will have residents cranking up air-conditioners, fans and swamp coolers, California is asking residents to set their thermostats to 78-degrees to cut back on energy usage. The State has issued a Flex Alert. The alert calls on residents to conserve energy in the afternoon and in the evening hours.We are looking at another heat wave in the western United States, including CA. Heat waves may have existed long before climate change, but their duration and intensity have never been more challenging. Visit https://t.co/j4p2wm6Qa3 for more information and ways to stay cool. pic.twitter.com/jlanr3tf7A— Office of the Governor of California (@CAgovernor) September 1, 2022","An electric vehicle charging station is seen in the parking lot of a metro station in Norwalk, Calif., Monday, Aug. 29, 2022.  California will phase out the sale of new gas cars by 2035.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre was forced to defend the decision to have Marine Corps Officers stand in the background of Joe Biden’s divisive speech after the President caught heat from not only Conservatives but from left-wing media mainstays.A CNN reporter was one of many to point out that the military is meant to be kept apolitical. Brianna Keilar claimed that Biden standing in front of two Marines was disparaging to half the Country.Whatever you think of this speech the military is supposed to be apolitical. Positioning Marines in uniform behind President Biden for a political speech flies in the face of that. It’s wrong when Democrats do it. It’s wrong when Republicans do it.— Brianna Keilar (@brikeilarcnn) September 2, 2022 A guest on her show, an Iraq War veteran, also weighed in. Allison Jaslow said that though she may agree with sentiments in Biden’s speech, it’s hard to not see the Marine Officers as a prop.“Somebody made the decision to put those Marines in the shot,” Jaslow said. “The reality is those Marines didn’t have a choice whether to be there or not. They could be like myself, who if I was in the military still (I) would have agreed with the President and would’ve welcomed being at the event yesterday, but we don’t know if that’s true. The reality of it is that we need to make sure that our military is as removed from politics as possible.”The White House has dismissed any concerns. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre has claimed that Biden’s speech was not political.“The way we see it here, and I would argue the way many Americans across the country see it, is standing up for democracy is not political,” Jean Pierre said. “Defending rights and freedom is not political…We don’t call any of that political, we see that as leadership and we see that as Presidential.”The Press Secretary’s comments were contradictory to what the President said during his speech. “They fanned the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights to the pursuit of justice. To the rule of law, to the very soul of this country,” Biden said. “Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy. No, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love… Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.”Karine Jean Pierre went on to say that it’s not unusual to have Presidents deliver speeches in front of servicemembers.

Sarah Palin addresses supporters at the opening of her new campaign headquarters in Anchorage, Alaska, on Wednesday, April 20, 2022.

Don Young, who held the job for 49 years. (AP Photo/Mark Thiessen)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:26 PM PT – Sunday, September 4, 2022For the first time in half a century, a Democrat is representing Alaska’s at-large seat in Washington, D.C.. In August’s special election to fill the remainder of the late Don Young’s (R-Alaska) term, Democrat Mary Peltola pulled about 40-percent of first preference votes compared to former Governor Sarah Palin’s (R-Alaska) 31-percent and Republican Nick Begich’s 29-percentBegich was dropped in the subsequent round of counting preferences. Those who chose him as their first preference had their second preferences redistributed to the remaining candidates. About half of Begich’s voters chose Palin as their second choice and over a quarter chose Peltola. However, due to the distribution of Begich voters second choice and how well Peltola did with first preferences, she was able to eke out a less than three-point victory over second place Palin.Under Alaska’s ranked choice voting, all candidates run in an open primary. The top four performing candidates go on to fight in the ranked choice general election. At the general election, voters are given the option to rank those four candidates by preference. If a majority votes for one candidate in the first round, then the winner is declared without preferences being counted. However, if nobody can hit that 50-percent plus one margin then the poorest performing candidate is dropped and their voters second preferences are redistributed to the remaining candidates. These rounds of counting go on until someone wins a majority.Alaska is the second state to adopt ranked choice for federal elections. It was first done in Maine back in 2018. 45th President Donald Trump won one of the States electoral votes under the system during the 2020 election.With Alaska’s general election fast approaching, many in Conservative media fear that the State’s voting system could very well hand Democrats another victory for a full term in the House and give anti-Trump Republican Lisa Murkowski another term in the Senate. Jack Posobiec, Senior Editor at Human Events spoke on the topic.“You will always see Democrats or soft conservatives, soft Republicans, your one of fours, or even your four of fours who are more establishment types, they will put Murkowski as their second choice so she’ll pick up a larger swathe of voters,” Posobiec said. “Meanwhile, a MAGA Conservative is never going to say they want a Democrat as their second choice.”While a quarter of moderate Begich supporters did give their preference to Peltola over Palin, the 11,000 who failed to rank further candidates preferenced about two-to-one for Palin like the rest did. However, Palin can still be headed to Washington with a slim majority of the vote. The system was originally pushed for by Murkowski donors and staffers. They assumed it would save the unpopular Senator once again from the wrath of Conservative Alaskans. While that could still prove true, if Republicans take full advantage of the system in November by ranking their preferences instead of exhausting their ballots, not only could Murkowski be defeated but Palin could wrangle the seat out of Democrat hands.Murkowski’s top opponent, Trump endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, believes that the majority of Alaskans have never supported the Senator. In fact, Murkowski has never won a majority of the votes in any election she’s been in. According to Tshibaka, this combined with ranked choice voting could prove to be Murkowski’s ultimate undoing.","Former Alaska Gov.

Vance is hoping to best Democrat Representative Tim Ryan for the coveted seat to go to Capitol Hill. The seat that the two men are fighting for is being vacated by Republican Senator Rob Portman. Portman announced his retirement in January.The Hillbilly Elegy author rose to fame when his best-selling book hit the top in 2016. Analysts say his book was a window into rural Americans. The novel also explained why Ohio swung for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Since then, the venture capitalist has been a thought leader.

Vance on the other hand not only wants to hold his Democrat opponent’s feet to the fire, but he also wants to reform the Republican party.The Senate hopeful shared with One America’s Dan Ball the biggest issue he has with Ryan’s political evolution.“They pretend that they believe one thing when it’s like look the video clip is right there of you saying something two years ago,” Vance said. “For example, Tim Ryan, who I’m now running against, is trying to claim that he’s really supportive of Trump’s tariffs on the Chinese yet two, three years ago he was one of the biggest fighters against those tariffs. Look, you can have a change of opinion but at least be honest and admit that you believe something different and that the facts made you change your mind. I think when people try to pretend that they’re something they’re not, that’s when politicians get into trouble.”The Republican is capitalizing on this area of opportunity because he doesn’t think Ryan can represent the best interests of Ohio.","DELAWARE, OH – APRIL 23: J.D.

However the released information does not include Social Security numbers, detailed financial account data, full individual income information and other sensitive information that could affect a taxpayer’s credit.The information that was released came from Form 990-T, a tax document required for people with retirement accounts which earn income for certain types of business within those plans. The agency said it immediately removed the files after uncovering the mistake. The IRS attributes the mistake to human error when initially posting the data.","A man walks into the Internal Revenue Service building in Washington, DC on March 10, 2016. / AFP / Andrew Caballero-Reynolds (Photo credit should read ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-514653578.jpg, Pentagon Ramps Up Arms Sales To Compete With ChinaTOPICS:financial moneyianIRSnewsOANNpoliticstaxpayer SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/irs-accidentally-leaks-confidential-info-of-120k-taxpayers/

Franklin / Associated Press)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:03 PM PT – Saturday, September 3, 2022Following Joe Biden’s prime-time speech where he declared tens of millions of Americans to be a very threat to the republic, one Republican stood up first to condemn the divisiveness. Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake slammed Joe Biden’s so-called Soul of America speech.On Thursday, in front of Independence Hall which was bathed in blood red lights, Biden, who was flanked on both sides by armed Marines, declared half of the nation’s voters to be a threat to democracy and to the republic itself. During his speech, the Democrat also cast aspersions on the tens of millions of citizens who voted for 45th President Donald J. Trump.America has often made its greatest progress after coming out of our darkest hours. pic.twitter.com/yYXWsq3DLt— President Biden (@POTUS) September 2, 2022The first Republican to give a standing response and press briefing on the speech was Lake. She came out immediately following Biden’s address. Lake was not a fan of the speech. “I have just watched the most absurd, frankly obscene address I’ve ever seen a President give to the American people,” she said.The Republican defended the tens of millions of Make America Great Again supporters. She said that Biden seemed to hold many of his fellow citizens in complete contempt.“What I saw was somebody who is trying to divide this Country. I’m not sure what’s wrong with Joe Biden,” Lake remarked.  “I know he may have problems that we don’t know about, but what I saw with him was somebody who carries in his heart a great deal of disdain for a whole lot of really good American people.”Lake pointed a finger at Democrats who claim Trump and his Republican supporters are racist. She highlighted that her opponent in the race for Governor in Arizona has been convicted for being racist in her public life.“I’m running against a politician named Katie Hobbs, who is a twice-convicted racist,” Lake said. “Who we the people are paying her settlement for because she did not want to pay women and people of color what they were worth in the workforce.”When she opened up the floor for questions, Lake was asked by a Democrat friendly journalist about how she can claim to want unity while questioning if the 2020 election was the most secure in history..@KariLake to Reporter: “We’re going to bring back freedom of speech. And maybe some day you’ll thank us for that” pic.twitter.com/qHy3TNryik— Kari Lake (@KariLake) September 2, 2022“How does that divide the country?” Lake questioned. “Questioning an, questioning an election where there are obviously problems is dividing the country? Since when can not ask questions about our elections? I was a journalist for many years. I was a journalist after 2016, and I distinctly remember many people just like you asking a lot of questions about the 2016 election results.”To close out, Lake was asked if she would concede if she loses to Katie Hobbs. In response, the Republican answered promptly.“I’m not gonna lose to Katie Hobbs,” Lake remarked""I'm not going to lose to @katiehobbs.""– @KariLake pic.twitter.com/zjPqw4JRMu— Kari Lake War Room (@KariLakeWarRoom) September 2, 2022","Kari Lake, Republican candidate for Arizona governor, waves to supporters prior to speaking at a news conference after the election Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022, in Phoenix.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 4:17 PM PT – Saturday, September 3, 2022Authorities in Michigan are investigating how a voting machine that went missing following the election wound up for sale online. According to a statement from the State on Friday, the machine was purchased by a cyber-security expert in Connecticut. The cyber-security expert has told authorities about his find and is currently waiting for officials to pick the machine up.Forensic tracing has shown that the machine was first purchased by an Ohio man at a Goodwill store in northern Michigan last month. The man purchased the machine for $8. Soon after, the machine wound up on eBay. It was selling for $1,200 on the website.  Harri Hursti, an election machine security expert, reportedly saw the listing and purchased it outright.“The fact that someone is selling voting machines on eBay, or on GovDeals, or any other site happens all the time,” Hursti said. “Most of the time, the seller is a government, a County, or an electronic recycling.”Authorities have instructed Hursti to leave the machine in the box it came in as they plan to swab the device for evidence. Hursti asserted that the theft of the machine raises questions regarding how the election machines are stored and guarded. Michigan law prevents citizens from holding, misusing or destroying voting machines. In addition, it prevents citizens from obtaining “undue possession” of the machines.","MINNEAPOLIS, MN – AUGUST 14: A sign reading “Vote Here” points toward a polling place for the 2018 Minnesota primary election at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church on August 14, 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
