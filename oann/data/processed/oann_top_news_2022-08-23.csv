10:23 AM PT",Court Grants Judicial Watch Request: Orders Partial Release of Trump Raid Affidavit,"Court Grants Judicial Watch Request: Orders Partial Release of Trump Raid AffidavitJudicial Watch — RELEASEUPDATED 10:23 AM PT – Monday, August 22, 2022(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton made the following statement regarding Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart’s latest decision partially granting Judicial Watch’s request to unseal the affidavit and other materials used to justify the unprecedented raid on former President Trump’s home:Judge Reinhart today affirmed his decision to deny the Biden administration’s attempt to keep the affidavit completely sealed. He states in today’s ruling that “given the intense public and historical interest in an unprecedented search of a former President’s residence, the Government has not yet shown that these administrative concerns are sufficient to justify sealing.”In the meantime, the Biden DOJ continues to dishonestly hide its reasons for its abusive and unprecedented raid on the home of former President Trump. We’re glad the court agrees the secrecy must end.The courts should reject the Biden DOJ “modified limited hangout” approach to coming clean about abuse of President Trump.Four additional filings were made public today. Click here.After last week’s hearing in West Palm Beach, FL, the court issued an order which stated:As I ruled from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing, I find that on the present record the Government has not met its burden of showing that the entire affidavit should remain sealed. It is ORDERED that by noon EST on Thursday, August 25, 2022, the Government shall file under seal its proposed redactions along with a legal memorandum setting forth the justification for the proposed redactions.The court also ordered the release of other documents concerning the warrant.Judicial Watch has been in the forefront in the court battle for transparency regarding the abusive FBI raid.On August 9, Judicial Watch filed its motion asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to unseal as soon as possible the search warrant materials used by the FBI to raid President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida (U.S. v. Sealed Search Warrant (Case No. 9:22-mj-08332)).On August 11, the DOJ filed a motion offering to unseal certain warrant materials.On August 12, Judicial Watch Judicial Watch filed President Trump’s public statement with the court, in which he made it clear that he would not oppose the release of documents related to the August 8, 2022, raid. Later that day, the DOJ made a partial release of the Trump raid warrant materials.Initially, the Albany Times Union and the New York Times joined Judicial Watch in filing for the unsealing of the warrant by filing an amicus letter and motion respectively. Other interests later joined in the effort.The Justice Department was ordered by Magistrate Judge Reinhart to respond by August 15 to Judicial Watch’s Motion to Unseal the warrant and supporting materials behind the FBI raid. In its filing, the Justice Department alleged that releasing the affidavit would “cause significant and irreparable damage” to its ongoing criminal investigation.On August 17, Judicial Watch submitted its reply to the DOJ’s effort to keep under seal the affidavit used to justify the controversial raid on the home of former President Trump. Judicial Watch cited former President Trump’s support for the release of the affidavit.TOPICS:Biden AdministrationDOJFBIJudicial WatchMar-a-LagonewsOANOANNpoltiicsRAIDTom Fitton SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/court-grants-judicial-watch-request-orders-partial-release-of-trump-raid-affidavit/

FALLON / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 3:23 PM PT – Monday, August 22, 2022Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently said he is looking into ways to streamline the country’s National Guard amid an increase in violence in the country. Reports said that Lopez Obrador has flirted with bypassing Mexico’s Congress in order to give control of the National Guard to Mexico’s army. This would give Mexico’s military control over policing practices in the country. Many civilians believe that this would be a breach of Lopez Obrador’s campaign promise to give control over policing to the people. Director of the Foundation of Justice, Ana Lorena Delgadillo, spoke on the topic. “What it brings as a consequence is that we don’t have any control of what goes on inside,” Delgadillo said. “In other words, I think the paradigm that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador maintains that the army is not corrupt, that the army is honest, and that the army is different from the police is false.”Mexican voters supported Lopez Obrador’s initial creation of the National Guard back in 2019. They resonated with his pledge to have the branch be controlled by the people by 2024. However, that plan was put on hold after violence broke out in cities across the country.In Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, a gang fight reportedly broke out in a local prison that spilled out into the streets. The fight resulted in the deaths of 11 people. Additionally in Tijuana, authorities said that cartel members set up roadblocks and set fires ablaze. That prompted the US Consulate in the border town to issue a shelter-in-place order for American nationals. Yesterday in #Tijuana there were at least 10 narco blockades of vehicles set on fire in different areas of the city. Authorities  have not confirmed the number of fires attended.#BajaCalifornia #Mexicohttps://t.co/TMOFkt7uiR pic.twitter.com/lwNOKspVnF— Borderland Beat (@Borderland_Beat) August 13, 2022These events put the US Consulate in Tijuana on high alert. Embassy officials are urging Americans to stay out of hot spot zones and to engage in local events with extreme caution. The State Department has issued a warning for people who want to travel to Mexico. The Department announced that there’s been an increase in kidnappings, homicides and other violent crimes throughout the country.In response to the violence, Mexico has launched several operations that have led to the arrests of nearly 170-cartel members and top drug lords. However, critics of a state controlled police force believe fighting fire with fire doesn’t always work. Sofía de Robina, a pro Juárez Human Rights Center lawyer shared her thoughts. “We see that there is a greater willingness to use force, often lethal force due to the very nature of these types of military institutions, without this actually leading to a decrease in violence,” she said. “We even see an absence of a much more strategic vision of the different regions, but rather a virtual territorial occupation by military logic without taking into account the prevailing situations.”Meanwhile, on the American side of the border, the issue over border security continues to rage. Several states, including in Texas and Florida, have launched operations to crackdown on drug and human traffickers. Additionally, Republican lawmakers and law enforcement officers in border towns are calling on Joe Biden to increase border security, keep Trump-era policies remaining in Mexico and to not vilify border agents. Without the mainstream media sounding the alarm, Biden has re-started border construction in Yuma, Arizona.","TOPSHOT – A Mexican National Guard vehicle drives past children playing as families of asylum seekers wait outside the El Chaparral border crossing port in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico on February 19, 2021. – (Photo by Patrick T.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Caitlin Sinclair, OAN NY Political CorrespondentUPDATED 2:45 PM PT – Monday, August 22, 2022New Yorkers are heading to the polls to vote in the state’s second round of primary elections, with several key congressional races on the ballot and as far as endorsements go, the approval of one in particular is standing out. New York Mayor Eric Adams has favored a few candidates. In Tuesday’s state Senate primary, Mayor Adams endorsed three candidates facing rivals backed by the democratic socialists of America. The Mayor said the endorsements are meant to help elect people willing to tighten the state’s bail law, a move that he believes is needed to address an uptick in serious crime.During an unrelated press conference he addressed his recent backings;“I just want reasonable thinking lawmakers. I want people that are responding to the constituents, the people of this city, they want to support the police, they want safe streets, they want to make sure people who are part of the catch-release-repeat system don’t continue to hurt innocent New Yorkers.”The Mayor has recently held a fundraiser for Miguelina Camilo, a lawyer running against Senator Gustavo Rivera in the Bronx. Mr. Rivera was endorsed by representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Additionally, in a newly created Senate district that covers parts of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan, the Mayor has endorsed a moderate Democrat, Elizabeth Crowley, over Kristen Gonzalez, a tech worker who is supported by the democratic socialists. In Brooklyn, Mr. Adams endorsed incumbent Senator Kevin Parker, who is facing a challenge from Kaegan Mays-Williams, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney, and David Alexis, a former lyft driver and co-founder of the drivers cooperative who also has support from the democratic socialists.Yet, it’s unclear just how much influence Mr. Adams’s endorsements will have when overall voter turnout is a topic of concern. If you thought turnout was low before, this second primary is expected to have an even worse turnout. Recent voter statistics showed that Tuesday’s primary could possibly be even sleepier than June’s contest, which featured the race for governor and drew fewer than 475,000 registered citywide Democrats to cast their ballots. Due not only to lack of knowledge about the divided primaries, but to the race falling on a popular travel month, voters may be hard to come by. That means that a very small percentage of the electorate will have an outsized influence on a number of consequential races, some of which may ultimately impact Democrats’ control of the house. So, Eric Adams is attempting to use endorsements to influence policy. Let us see if New Yorkers play along.","NEW YORK, NEW YORK – JUNE 08: Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who’s running as a Democratic mayoral candidate, June 8, 2021 in the Queens borough of New York City.

Megan Brock (Nos. 2022-03083 and 2022-02979)).Bucks County filed multiple suits against Brock to prevent the release of the documents after the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records found in Brock’s favor and ordered Bucks County to search for and release the documents in two Right-to-Know Law requests.Brock sent a February 7, 2022, request asking for all electronic correspondence by Bucks Co. Director of Policy and Communications Eric Nagy with Board Vice Chair Diane Ellis-Marseglia, Board Chair Bob Harvie, former Director of the Commissioners’ Office of Public Information Larry King, Chief Clerk Gail Humphrey, and Health Department Director David Damsker from 8/10/2021 to 8/28/2021, on the buckscounty.gov domain. Also, all communications about Bucks County Health Department School Guidance.A March 8, 2022, request asks for a copy of an email sent to Acting Chief Operating Officer Margaret McKevitt on 8/23/2021 on the buckscounty.gov domain, which contained the final copy of the Bucks County COVID-19 Amended School Guidance, including all responses.On July 18, 2022, Judicial Watch’s local counsel, J.

They believe Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf’s administration coerced the county into adopting its more restrictive Covid policies and its one-size-fits-all approach to school reopening.”TOPICS:COVIDCOVID-19J.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:12 AM PT – Monday, August 22, 2022Lawmakers and advisers close to 45th President Donald Trump have stressed the 2022 midterm elections are immensely important to change the direction of the country. America First patriots are calling for more representation in Congress.On Saturday, former prosecutor Kimberly Guilfoyle and National Finance Chair for the Make America Great Again Again super PAC stressed the best has yet to come. She said the Pennsylvania Senate race is immensely important between Trump-endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz and leftist John Fetterman who suffered a stroke on the campaign trail earlier this year.Guilfoyle warned Fetterman has a dangerous soft-on-crime platform similar to far left Democrats, promising safe illicit drug injection sites and to empty out one-third of Pennsylvania’s prison population. She further underscored, the number one problem in the Keystone State should be who the most law and order candidate is and not someone who will let violent criminals roam the streets.“That is why we put people away for a long time or for life that commit these kind of atrocities,” she stated. “Can you even imagine 90 percent of the people in a burial in a cemetery being from violent crime? I mean, it’s absolutely outrageous. It’s not like aging, dying and, you know, old age etc. It’s not. I mean this is something that should be alarming to everyone. That should be the number one issue right now in Pennsylvania. Who is going to support law and order?”In contrast, Guilfoyle pointed to Dr. Oz as the candidate voters should chose come November, pointing out his pledge to give back to the community. She touted Oz’s “back the blue” policy proposals, understanding of hard work and personification of the American dream. She added, Oz is the candidate Pennsylvania deserves.Breitbart · Kimberly Guilfoyle – August 20, 2022Meanwhile, Trump-endorsed North Carolina congressional candidate Bo Hines slammed another destructive Democrat economic policy. He derided Democrats for passing the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which he asserted will weaponize the IRS against America’s middle class.Hines said this is a part of what he calls Joe Biden’s “Build Back Broke” agenda that failed to pass through Congress in its entirety. He believes now individual parts, but says those laws will do nothing but sink the US economy. However, Hines said there’s an army of America First candidates ready to take on the Washington establishment.“In the next Congress, it’s more important now than ever that we have strong conservatives that will actually stand up and use the institutions that are there to investigate things that Americans care about,” he stated. “You know, we can’t play idol ball on the sidelines and sit there and hope that something happens. We actually have to act, we have to do it and take back the majority in the House.”Breitbart · Bo Hines – August 20, 2022In the meantime., GOP strategists and lawmakers are trying to simmer hopes of a total red wave during the November elections, stressing the a takeover of the House is more likely than a takeover of the Senate. Meanwhile, Rasmussen reports show Republicans have at least a five-point lead over Democrats in who voters want to represent them in Congress.","Former Trump campaign senior advisor Kimberly Guilfoyle speaks to supporters President Donald Trump during a panel discussion, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, in San Antonio.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:55 AM PT – Monday, August 22, 2022Managing director of the Institute of International Finance, Sonja Gibbs, warned of rising risks posed by so-called ‘zombie companies’ to the US economy. During an interview on Sunday, Gibbs said that many companies accumulated unsustainable levels of debt over the past decade due to ultra-low interest rates. As a result, these companies need a bailout or more loans in order to continue to operate. Gibbs said that some of these ‘zombie companies’ need to be kept afloat because their failure would pose a systemic risk.“Amongst the list of zobidie companies you might find a company like Wework. You know, a company that has been very successful, but at the same time the pandemic has changed a lot of things for that company,” said Gibbs. “Carnival Cruise Lines is another good example of a type of company who’s now in the zombie category or some of the meme stock, you know AMC or GameStop.

He highlighted the administration’s push to increase vaccination efforts. As we head #BackToSchool, the administration is laying out key supports for protecting students, teachers, & schools this upcoming year. ☑️ Vaccines & Boosters ☑️ Free Testing Clinics ☑️ Improved Air Quality ☑️ Guidance for Managing Exposure https://t.co/eaFFDmwPg1— Secretary Miguel Cardona (@SecCardona) August 21, 2022The Education Secretary also asserted that he’s spoken to White House COVID coordinator, Doctor Ashish Jha and to the CDC director, Rochelle Walensky. He noted that they are both optimistic for the upcoming school year as well.“I want families thinking about how this year is gonna be a better year than last year,” Cardona said. “We have better tools, better resources and we should expect a better school year for our students and our families.”The Education Secretary said that families shouldn’t be worried about monkeypox and they have the tools needed to keep kids safe in schools. This comes after the CDC recently admitted that they botched their COVID-19 response. The CDC admitted its fault following an internal review that found that the agency takes too long to publish its data and that its guidance is confusing. The monkeypox outbreak started in the United Kingdom back in May. The Biden administration declared it a public health emergency earlier this month. As of August 18, the US has reported more than 14,000 confirmed cases nationwide. Doctor Caroline Schrodt, from The Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology at the CDC, recently spoke on how one can contract the virus. “In the current monkeypox outbreak, those with monkeypox disease are generally describing close sustained physical contact with other people who have monekypox. CDC is not receiving reports of monkeypox  transmission without close physical contact,” Schrodt said. “While many of those affected in the current global outbreak are gay, bisexual or (are) men who have sex with other men, not all cases fall into these categories and anyone can catch monkeypox if (they) have close contact with someone who has monkeypox regardless of gender identity or their sexual orientation.”A recent government study suggested the monkeypox virus can linger on several common household objects, such as couches, light switches or blankets for days, but it noted that the risk of infection is low.","Dr. Miguel Cardona, US President-Elect Joe Biden’s nominee for Education Secretary, speaks during an event announcing his nomination at The Queen in Wilmington, Delaware, on December 23, 2020.

He asserted that the FBI’s raid of Mara-a-Lago was “baseless” and “political.” On Friday, Fitton said the FBI and the Department of Justice have been hijacked to target political opponents of Joe Biden and the left.“When you have federal law enforcement being used in this way, not to advance the interest of the public, not to advance rule of law, not to fairly administer justice, but to target the political opponents of the current administration — that way lies the death of the Republic,” Fitton stated.The Judicial Watch president claimed nothing warranted the raid on Trump’s home. He heavily focused on the Presidential Records Act, which allows the president to designate which records are presidential and which are personal.Fitton brought up “the Clinton tapes,” where it was discovered President Bill Clinton kept dozens of tape recordings capturing moments through his presidency. Judicial Watch took the National Archives and Records Administration to court, declaring the audiotapes were “presidential records” and be moved to the Clinton Presidential Library.“The lawyer for the archives told a federal court judge that because a president had certain records after the presidency that he had not turned over to the archives at the end of his presidency, they were presumed to be personal,” Fitton explained.The Judicial Watch president asserted Trump was open to working with authorities on handing over documents and it’s concerning a court allowed the raid to take place.“Under the law, no one but the president gets to pick what’s presidential records,” said Fitton. “No one but the president gets to pick what are personal records. And the archivist, which is being used as a cutout for the anti-Trumpers running our government here is D.C., has no authority to second guess him.”Meanwhile, this comes as President Trump hinted at taking legal action over the raid. In a post to Truth Social, Trump said a motion pertaining to the Fourth Amendment will be filed soon.“A major motion pertaining to the Fourth Amendment will soon be filed concerning the illegal Break-In of my home, Mar-a-Lago, right before the ever important Mid-Term Elections. My rights, together with the rights of all Americans, have been violated at a level rarely seen before in our Country. Remember, they even spied on my campaign. The greatest Witch Hunt in USA history has been going on for six years, with no consequences to the scammers. It should not be allowed to continue!”— Donald Trump via Truth SocialThe Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, and Trump said his rights have been violated at a level rarely seen before in this country.","FILE – President Donald Trump arrives at the White House in Washington, on Dec. 31, 2020.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP22083037706165-e1659730886519.jpg, Heritage Foundation’s Blair: D.C.
