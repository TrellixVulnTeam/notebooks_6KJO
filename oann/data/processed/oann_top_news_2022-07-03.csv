1:54 PM PT",Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis gaining popularity as front runner for Oval Office in 2024,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is becoming a household name among Republicans, garnering praise for his strong leadership and taking on the Biden White House.Earlier this week, podcast host and UFC commentator Joe Rogan seemed to throw his weight behind DeSantis for a run at the Oval Office in 2024. Rogan praised the Florida Republican for his leadership through the pandemic while asserting he would make a much better leader than the current president.Rogan also called the governor’s decisions in the face of controversy “admirable,” while pointing to the harsh criticism DeSantis received for his COVID-19 policies, which ultimately proved to be just as or more successful than the response by Democrat states.“I think Ron DeSantis would work as a good president,” Rogan stated. “…He was correct when it comes to protecting our vulnerable populations. He was correct in terms of distribution of monoclonal antibodies, and he was furious when the government tried to pull those, they were trying to pull very effective treatments. You know, he is not perfect, he’s a human being, but what he’s done is stand up for freedoms. “Rogan joined Tesla CEO Elon Musk in potentially backing DeSantis for president should he choose to run for the White House. Musk first expressed his support for the governor in a Twitter thread this month, saying he was ”leaning towards’ backing him in 2024.While DeSantis has gained plaudits for his performance in office, former President Donald Trump has said he’s partially responsible for DeSantis winning the governor’s race in 2018. Trump has maintained the governor couldn’t have won the seat without his endorsement.DeSantis has largely brushed off questions about a future presidential bid while calling reporters questions “futile” and downplaying his political ambitions. Though he’s currently intent on earning a second term in the Sunshine State, recent polling indicates he and Trump would be among voters top choices in New Hampshire, which is  one of the first states being contested in the 2024 presidential primary.Meanwhile, Trump has not ruling out DeSantis could be his running mate in 2024. in a recent interview, the 45th President said neither ‘yes’ or ‘no’ when answering a question about his running mate. Trump explained that he has a “good relationship” with the Florida governor. He also said DeSantis is very successful, partially because of his MAGA agenda This may suggest a Trump-DeSantis pact isn’t completely out of the question for the 2024 presidential campaign.EXCLUSIVE: On Thursday's ""Wake Up America,"" @RobFinnertyUSA asked fmr.

(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:15 AM PT – Thursday, June 30, 2022Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sent an alarming message about the state of the US economy on President Joe Biden’s watch. He admitted there’s no guarantee for so-called “soft landing” and a recession is possible.While speaking at a European Central Bank Forum in Portugal on Wednesday, Powell said he couldn’t guarantee that the Federal Reserve can bring inflation back down while also retaining a strong labor market. This means interest rates will continue to go up, which may cause an increase in unemployment.The Fed chair also added, he’s committed to utilizing every tool at his disposal to ensure economic stability, although he admitted there’s a risk for the Fed going too far and triggering a recession. His remarks came after the US Central Bank raised interest rates in an attempt to curb inflation.“We think that there are pathways for us to achieve the path back to 2 percent inflation while still retaining a strong labor market,” Powell stated. “We believe we can do that. That is our aim. There’s no guarantee that we can do that.”His comments come as the Consumer Confidence Index dropped by 4.5 points this week. US consumers are expecting economic growth to “significantly weaken” in the second half of this year. This drop has been attributed to a number of reasons such as rising costs for basic necessities, supply chain problems and concerns about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Today, Chair Powell confirmed: @federalreserve's interest rate hikes won't bring down gas and food prices for families.But they could throw millions of out of their jobs, trigger a recession, and drive our economy off a cliff. pic.twitter.com/sD3fzn4KrZ— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 22, 2022“We’re strongly committed to using our tools to get inflation to come down,” said Powell. “The way to do that is to slow down growth, ideally keeping it positive. Is there a risk that would go too far? Certainly, there’s a risk.”Economists are saying the probability of the US experiencing a broad economic crisis is rising and could possibly occur in 2023 or even sooner. In the meantime, Biden still insists a recession is not inevitable, despite worsening projections by economists.Biden burying his head in the sand and denying that a recession is coming will not solve the problem.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:33 AM PT – Thursday, June 30, 2022The suspected driver of the truck carrying dozens of migrants has been arrested alongside his alleged conspirator. The alleged driver was located Wednesday hiding near the area where the abandoned truck was found. This came after two Mexican nationals were arrested for their involvement in the incident that left 53 migrants dead from extreme heat.If convicted, all four suspects could face life in a federal prison or the death penalty. A San Antonio judge has ordered them to remain in custody while they wait for their preliminary hearing, which is scheduled for Friday. Meanwhile, families back home in Mexico are awaiting news of loved ones who they fear may be among those who died in that tractor trailer.This comes after dozens of migrants were found trapped in a tractor trailer that tipped over on a highway in San Antonio, Texas with some survivors being transported to area hospitals in varying conditions. The events unfolded on a sweltering day with temperatures reaching 100-degrees outside. Officials said there was no working AC or signs of water in the truck.President Joe Biden’s policies are under scrutiny following the apparent human smuggling operation. Republicans have called this tragedy another example of the current administration’s open border policies with no deterrence in the US immigration system.Horrified at the tragic loss of life near San Antonio. This speaks to the desperation of migrants who would put their lives in the hands of callous human smugglers who show no regard for human life. We’ll be working w/ our partners to assist in every way w/ the investigation.— CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus (@CBPChrisMagnus) June 28, 2022San Antonio Mayor, Ron Nirenberg lamented at the human toll accumulated by traffickers taking advantage of people in need.“So I would urge you all to think compassionately and pray for the deceased, the ailing, the families,” he noted. “And we hope that those responsible for putting these people in such inhumane conditions are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”The incident is not the first human smuggling tragedy San Antonio has witnessed. Back in 2017, 10 migrants perished while trapped inside a truck at a Walmart parking lot. Additionally, the bodies of 19 migrants were found inside a vehicle during a heat wave back in 2003.Critics have lambasted Biden’s border policies since he took office. The administration has overseen the largest surge of border violations in more than 20-years by migrants coming in through the southern border. Policies scrutinized under the microscope include his attempted reversal of the Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ and Title 42 policies that sought to keep migrants out of the US for health reasons or while their immigration applications were being processed.","Mourners visit a make-shift memorial at the site where dozens of suspected migrants died in an abandoned tractor-trailer, Thursday, June 30, 2022, in San Antonio.

(Photo by Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:12 AM PT – Thursday, June 30, 2022Texas Governor Greg Abbott is taking further steps to rein in the crisis at the southern border. The Republican recently addressed the recent horrific finding at the southern border, a truck filled with deceased migrant, and demanded action be taken.“Under President Trump, we saw the fewest illegal crossings in decades,” he stated. “Under President Biden we see all-time record highs.”In a press conference on Wednesday, Abbott said the truck carrying the migrants had to have travel through a checkpoint, but likely passed unchecked due to limited Border Patrol resources.“Many of these deaths could’ve been prevented if Biden simply fully funded the Border Patrol operation of the United States of America and implemented the policies that the Border Patrol needs in order to do the real job,” asserted the Governor. “…The real job is both to secure the border as well as to do things like inspect the vehicle that was carrying those people who lost their lives.”Abbott further urged the Biden administration to reinstate Trump-era policies like finishing the wall and re-implementing remain in Mexico. He highlighted the efforts of his own state while suggesting Texas is doing more than any state in history, including building its own wall and boosting security at the border.“DPS (Department of Public Safety) will create and implement a checkpoint strategy beginning immediately where they will begin targeting trucks like the one that was used where these people perished,” said Abbott. “To make sure that we will have a better capability of perhaps stopping future trucks like that, as well as stopping the smugglers and the cartel members who are trying to profiteer off of it.”Joined state & local officials in Eagle Pass to announce the expansion of Texas’ ongoing border security operations. @TxDPS @TXMilitaryThe Lone Star State will not sit idly by as President Biden ignores the crisis at our southern border. https://t.co/RJQFtQcOXK— Gov.

The Florida Department of Health is doubling down on its opposition to gender reassignment treatment for underage patients amid a spat with Levine.In a statement Tuesday, Florida officials reiterated experimental and irreversible medical treatments must not be provided to children and teenagers -who suffer from gender dysphoria. This comes after last week’s testimony by Levine, the first transgender cabinet official in history, who painted the Florida Health Department out to be an opponent of LGBTQ equality.The event, called the Pride Month Town Hall, was recently live-streamed by the DNC. During that discussion, Levine promoted gender-transitioning for minors and referred to transgender treatments as an “age appropriate” and a “critical tool.” It was during that event when the admiral suggested that the Florida Health Department was against the LGBTQ community and claimed opponents of gender-transitions for minors are “targeting trans youth to score political points.”Biden official Rachel Levine: Sex reassignment surgery and puberty blockers for KIDS is “lifesaving, medically necessary, age appropriate, and a critical tool” pic.twitter.com/OwSOA3cjj8— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 27, 2022The department fired back at Levine while taking issue with her claims that “this makes anyone at the department an “opponent of LGBTQ equality,” also adding that her comments are “nothing more than a poorly attempted character assassination.” Levine has yet to respond to the rebuttal by Florida officials.

In a five to four decision Thursday, the nation’s highest court ruled the Biden administration can terminate the Trump-era Remain in Mexico policy. The high court found the administration’s push to end the policy did not violate federal immigration law.Justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh sided with the court’s liberal justices in the ruling. The policy, first enacted in 2019, required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their claims were processed in court. Thursday’s decision now paves the way for Biden to go through with ending the policy. Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has called on the Biden administration to reinstate Trump-era policies, while asserting they have proved to be effective.“Building a border wall, keeping in place both Title 42 and the Remain in Mexico policy and enforcing those,” Abbott stated. “So, those policies remain in effect right now. However, it is my understanding that the way we see it, Biden is not enforcing those. Ending catch and release. Those are the four things that are very simple to do.”Earlier, the Supreme Court sided with Joseph Kennedy, a former high school football coach in Washington State, who was let go for publicly praying on the field after games. In the court’s opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch explained that both the free exercise and free speech clauses of the First Amendment protect expressions like Mr. Kennedy’s.“It’s not for the Christians or the Jews, or the atheists or whoever,” said Kennedy. “It is for all Americans and that’s why I thought this was such a huge win. It’s more a freedom of speech thing for me personally because it was just a moment between me and God. It had nothing to do with anybody else.”Additionally, the Supreme Court issued a ruling limiting the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. In a six-to-three decision, the court ruled the EPA cannot pass sweeping carbon dioxide emissions regulations without congressional approval. This is a victory for West Virginia and a number of other GOP-led states that challenged the EPA while arguing the Clean Air Act did not give the agency power to impose such broad regulations.The ruling could have far reaching ramifications as it may curb the Biden administrations capability to promote green energy through regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey responded to the Supreme Courts decision and thanked all the states that were part of the process.Alos, the Supreme Court welcomed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson Thursday as she was sworn in as the first black woman to serve on the nations highest court. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer officially stepped down from the bench after a 28-year career. Jackson is slated to participate in arguments for the first time during the court’s next term beginning in October.","FILE – This Oct. 4, 2018, file photo shows the U.S. Supreme Court at sunset in Washington.  (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21302863422771-e1656534397130.jpg," N.Y.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:20 AM PT – Friday, July 1, 2022The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act does not give the EPA broad or expansive powers to regulate carbon emissions, in turn, leaving it up to states. In a six to three vote on Thursday, the high court decided the executive agency could not impose regulations on states that restrict carbon emissions to encourage a transfer to renewable energy.The decision was met with praise from Republicans who argued the EPA could not implement such regulations nationally, while Democrats viewed it as a step backwards in fighting so-called climate change. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who spearheaded the legal challenge, called the decision a huge victory because it reaffirms the concept of separation of powers.“We want to make sure that the Biden agenda is limited by basis of what Congress authorized these agencies,” Morrisey. “What a concept that is and this should not be considered to be anything other than consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and our separation of powers.”Meanwhile across the aisle, several Democrat governors vowed to double down on their efforts to fight so-called climate change. Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) expressed disappointment in the decision and said state and local governments will have to pick up where the executive branch left off.“We have to accelerate our efforts to reduce carbon pollution in the state of Washington in the upcoming years and that’s necessary because the federal government now is going to be, frankly, much less effective in restraining pollution, which means more of that burden is going to be on our shoulders,” said Inslee. “And we are willing to accept that because Washington State is not going to allow climate change to swallow our state.”Inslee did not clarify what he plans to do in light of the ruling. However, California Governor  (D) took a more direct approach by announcing on Twitter that he will be signing a $54 billion climate fighting plan.“The idea that the US Supreme Court moved to take away one of the most significant and historically powerful tools to address the ravages of climate change is incomprehensible,” asserted Newsom. “We’ve got to wake up to what’s going on, Supreme Court.

He pledged another $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine. While wrapping up the NATO summit in Madrid on Thursday, Biden said the new package includes more ammunition and artillery and advanced air defense systems.“The war could end tomorrow, by the way, if Russia stops its irrational behavior,” stated the President. “So, you know, when the war will end, you know I hope it ends sooner than later, but for it to end they have to be in a position where…the the Ukrainians have all that they can reasonably expect. We can reasonably expect to get to them in order to provide for provide for their physical security and their defenses.”This came after Biden shared a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan while on his way to the summit in which he urged him to sign off on Finland and Sweden joining the NATO alliance.President Biden participated in the NATO Summit, taking place in Madrid, Spain, where he met with Allied Heads of State and Government. pic.twitter.com/GWEJpcUv47— The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 29, 2022Leaders strengthened defense along the eastern flank as Biden announced a boost of US military presence in Europe in response to Russian threats. This includes adding a permanent army headquarters in Poland, sending new warships to Spain fighter jet squadrons to Britain and deploying additional troops to Romania as well as increasing rotational deployments in the Baltic states.Biden assured the transatlantic alliance is stronger than ever before, but continued to blame Russia’s war on Ukraine for America’s rampant inflation.“But the bottom line is ultimately the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia,” said the President. “The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia. Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine and so, that’s the that’s the way in which I think we should move. And I think it will have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.”-Canceled drilling leases-Canceled pipelines -Limited domestic production-Imposed needless regulations-Discouraged energy investmentsGas prices aren't high because of the war in Ukraine.

Masters transformed those class notes into a New York Times bestseller: “Zero to One: Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future.”Before then, he was named one of Forbes Top 30 Under 30 in 2014. Masters helped top tier companies work through the tough questions and creating new value, instead of merely copying what’s worked in the past. He’s looking to make those talents and entrepreneurial insights work for the people of Arizona. Former President Donald Trump believes he can.COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT pic.twitter.com/T02CPKYRRp— Blake Masters (@bgmasters) June 27, 2022Trump said Masters will protect America’s borders, stand for life and election integrity. The 45th President warned Arizonans that other Senate candidates like Mark Brnovich and Jim Lamon will only let them down.Masters has been critical of Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly, particularly for his support for the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Masters said putting Jackson on the Supreme Court is unthinkable.“But this vote, this disastrous vote will be his legacy,” Masters stated. “To put a pedophile apologist on the Supreme Court, it makes my blood boil…”His time in Silicon Valley has showed him that an unholy alliance between Big Government, Big Tech and Big Business threatens to permanently upend America. As a Christian, husband, father, businessman, gun owner and an early member of President Trump’s MAGA movement, Masters refuses to let that happen.

7:02 AM PT","N.Y. to bar concealed carry in various locations, increase requirements","N.Y. to bar concealed carry in various locations, increase requirementsOAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:02 AM PT – Friday, July 1, 2022The Empire State is striking back against a recent Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment. Governor Kathy Hochul (D) unveiled a list of “sensitive locations” where concealed carriers will not be permitted to bring their firearms. During a press conference Wednesday, the Democrat rattled off a number of locations where the Second Amendment does not apply.“Federal, state, local government buildings, health and medical facilities, places where children gather, daycares, parks, zoos, playgrounds, public transportation, subways, buses, polling places, educational institutions,” Hochul noted. “And making sure that we have no open-carry policy as a default position for private businesses.”Hochul clarified that private businesses wishing to allow patrons to carry a concealed firearm in their establishments must put up signage expressly giving permission to do so. The move is a rebuttal to the Supreme Court ruling that struck down the New York’s strict “proper cause” requirement for those seeking concealed carry permits. The Democrat also pledged to make CCW and gun ownership requirements stricter to prevent criminals from stealing weapons from law-abiding citizens.“Twenty-five percent of gun crimes are committed with stolen guns. Where can they steal out of?” asked Hochul. “They can steal the out of your vehicle, so we’re adding a vehicle requirement to our safe storage laws. So you have to have them locked up when you’re traveling and right now, if you have children in your home under the age of 16, you have to have safe storage.”Those seeking a concealed carry permit will be required to complete 15-hours of experience at a firing range, while background checks will be conducted for the purchases of both guns and ammunition. Hochul said the new law will serve as a baseline gun policy for the Empire State, but localities are welcome to enforce stricter measures at their own discretion. The governor used her parting words to lambaste the Supreme Court for striking down New York’s original protocol.“And I wanna say, if six Supreme Court justices wanna take us backwards, we have a legislature full of duly elected representatives who actually speak for the people of this state and wanna protect a law that’s been on the books for over 100 years,” she asserted.Hochul called an “extraordinary session” Thursday to push the measure through the state legislature.The Assembly Chambe is pictured as the house stands at ease during a special legislative session as lawmakers consider new firearms regulations for concealed-carry permits at the state Capitol, Thursday, June 30, 2022, in Albany, N.Y.
