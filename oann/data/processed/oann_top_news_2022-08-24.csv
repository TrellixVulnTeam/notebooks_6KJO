FALLON / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 3:23 PM PT ‚Äì Monday, August 22, 2022Mexico‚Äôs President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently said he is looking into ways to streamline the country‚Äôs National Guard amid an increase in violence in the country. Reports said that Lopez Obrador has flirted with bypassing Mexico‚Äôs Congress in order to give control of the National Guard to Mexico‚Äôs army. This would give Mexico‚Äôs military control over policing practices in the country.¬†Many civilians believe that this would be a breach of Lopez Obrador‚Äôs campaign promise to give control over policing to the people. Director of the Foundation of Justice, Ana Lorena Delgadillo, spoke on the topic.¬†‚ÄúWhat it brings as a consequence is that we don‚Äôt have any control of what goes on inside,‚Äù Delgadillo said. ‚ÄúIn other words, I think the paradigm that President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador maintains that the army is not corrupt, that the army is honest, and that the army is different from the police is false.‚ÄùMexican voters supported Lopez Obrador‚Äôs initial creation of the National Guard back in 2019. They resonated with his pledge to have the branch be controlled by the people by 2024. However, that plan was put on hold after violence broke out in cities across the country.In Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, a gang fight reportedly broke out in a local prison that spilled out into the streets. The fight resulted in the deaths of 11 people. Additionally in Tijuana, authorities said that cartel members set up roadblocks and set fires ablaze. That prompted the US Consulate in the border town to issue a shelter-in-place order for American nationals.¬†Yesterday in #Tijuana there were at least 10 narco blockades of vehicles set on fire in different areas of the city. Authorities  have not confirmed the number of fires attended.#BajaCalifornia #Mexicohttps://t.co/TMOFkt7uiR pic.twitter.com/lwNOKspVnF‚Äî Borderland Beat (@Borderland_Beat) August 13, 2022These events put the US Consulate in Tijuana on high alert. Embassy officials are urging Americans to stay out of hot spot zones and to engage in local events with extreme caution. The State Department has issued a warning for people who want to travel to Mexico. The Department announced that there‚Äôs been an increase in kidnappings, homicides and other violent crimes throughout the country.In response to the violence, Mexico has launched several operations that have led to the arrests of nearly 170-cartel members and top drug lords. However, critics of a state controlled police force believe fighting fire with fire doesn‚Äôt always work. Sof√≠a de Robina, a pro Ju√°rez Human Rights Center lawyer shared her thoughts.¬†‚ÄúWe see that there is a greater willingness to use force, often lethal force due to the very nature of these types of military institutions, without this actually leading to a decrease in violence,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe even see an absence of a much more strategic vision of the different regions, but rather a virtual territorial occupation by military logic without taking into account the prevailing situations.‚ÄùMeanwhile, on the American side of the border, the issue over border security continues to rage. Several states, including in Texas and Florida, have launched operations to crackdown on drug and human traffickers.¬†Additionally, Republican lawmakers and law enforcement officers in border towns are calling on Joe Biden to increase border security, keep Trump-era policies remaining in Mexico and to not vilify border agents. Without the mainstream media sounding the alarm, Biden has re-started border construction in Yuma, Arizona.","TOPSHOT ‚Äì A Mexican National Guard vehicle drives past children playing as families of asylum seekers wait outside the El Chaparral border crossing port in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico on February 19, 2021. ‚Äì (Photo by Patrick T.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Caitlin Sinclair, OAN NY Political CorrespondentUPDATED 2:45 PM PT ‚Äì Monday, August 22, 2022New Yorkers are heading to the polls to vote in the state‚Äôs second round of primary elections, with several key congressional races on the ballot and as far as endorsements go, the approval of one in particular is standing out. New York Mayor Eric Adams has favored a few candidates.¬†In Tuesday‚Äôs state Senate primary, Mayor Adams endorsed three candidates facing rivals backed by the democratic socialists of America. The Mayor said the endorsements are meant to help elect people willing to tighten the state‚Äôs bail law, a move that he believes is needed to address an uptick in serious crime.During an unrelated press conference he addressed his recent backings;‚ÄúI just want reasonable thinking lawmakers. I want people that are responding to the constituents, the people of this city, they want to support the police, they want safe streets, they want to make sure people who are part of the catch-release-repeat system don‚Äôt continue to hurt innocent New Yorkers.‚ÄùThe Mayor has recently held a fundraiser for Miguelina Camilo, a lawyer running against Senator Gustavo Rivera in the Bronx. Mr. Rivera was endorsed by representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Additionally, in a newly created Senate district that covers parts of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan, the Mayor has endorsed a moderate Democrat, Elizabeth Crowley, over Kristen Gonzalez, a tech worker who is supported by the democratic socialists.¬†In Brooklyn, Mr. Adams endorsed incumbent Senator Kevin Parker, who is facing a challenge from Kaegan Mays-Williams, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney, and David Alexis, a former lyft driver and co-founder of the drivers cooperative who also has support from the democratic socialists.Yet, it‚Äôs unclear just how much influence Mr. Adams‚Äôs endorsements will have when overall voter turnout is a topic of concern. If you thought turnout was low before, this second primary is expected to have an even worse turnout.¬†Recent voter statistics showed that Tuesday‚Äôs primary could possibly be even sleepier than June‚Äôs contest, which featured the race for governor and drew fewer than 475,000 registered citywide Democrats to cast their ballots. Due not only to lack of knowledge about the divided primaries, but to the race falling on a popular travel month, voters may be hard to come by. That means that a very small percentage of the electorate will have an outsized influence on a number of consequential races, some of which may ultimately impact Democrats‚Äô control of the house.¬†So, Eric Adams is attempting to use endorsements to influence policy. Let us see if New Yorkers play along.","NEW YORK, NEW YORK ‚Äì JUNE 08: Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who‚Äôs running as a Democratic mayoral candidate, June 8, 2021 in the Queens borough of New York City.

She said the Pennsylvania Senate race is immensely important between Trump-endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz and leftist John Fetterman who suffered a stroke on the campaign trail earlier this year.Guilfoyle warned Fetterman has a dangerous soft-on-crime platform similar to far left Democrats, promising safe illicit drug injection sites and to empty out one-third of Pennsylvania‚Äôs prison population. She further underscored, the number one problem in the Keystone State should be who the most law and order candidate is and not someone who will let violent criminals roam the streets.‚ÄúThat is why we put people away for a long time or for life that commit these kind of atrocities,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúCan you even imagine 90 percent of the people in a burial in a cemetery being from violent crime? I mean, it‚Äôs absolutely outrageous. It‚Äôs not like aging, dying and, you know, old age etc. It‚Äôs not. I mean this is something that should be alarming to everyone. That should be the number one issue right now in Pennsylvania. Who is going to support law and order?‚ÄùIn contrast, Guilfoyle pointed to Dr. Oz as the candidate voters should chose come November, pointing out his pledge to give back to the community. She touted Oz‚Äôs ‚Äúback the blue‚Äù policy proposals, understanding of hard work and personification of the American dream. She added, Oz is the candidate Pennsylvania deserves.Breitbart ¬∑ Kimberly Guilfoyle ‚Äì August 20, 2022Meanwhile, Trump-endorsed North Carolina congressional candidate Bo Hines slammed another destructive Democrat economic policy. He derided Democrats for passing the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which he asserted will weaponize the IRS against America‚Äôs middle class.Hines said this is a part of what he calls Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild Back Broke‚Äù agenda that failed to pass through Congress in its entirety. He believes now individual parts, but says those laws will do nothing but sink the US economy. However, Hines said there‚Äôs an army of America First candidates ready to take on the Washington establishment.‚ÄúIn the next Congress, it‚Äôs more important now than ever that we have strong conservatives that will actually stand up and use the institutions that are there to investigate things that Americans care about,‚Äù he stated. ‚ÄúYou know, we can‚Äôt play idol ball on the sidelines and sit there and hope that something happens.

10:43 AM PT",Judicial Watch Files Taxpayer Lawsuit over Racially Discriminatory Minneapolis Teachers‚Äô Contract,"Judicial Watch Files Taxpayer Lawsuit over Racially Discriminatory Minneapolis Teachers‚Äô ContractJudicial Watch ‚Äî RELEASEUPDATED 10:43 AM PT ‚Äì Wednesday, August 24, 2022(Washington, DC) ‚Äì Judicial Watch announced today it filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Minneapolis taxpayer over a teachers‚Äô contract that provides discriminatory job protections to certain racial minorities. The lawsuit was filed against the superintendent of the Minneapolis Public Schools, the Minneapolis Public Schools, and the Minneapolis Board of Education for violating the Equal Protection Guarantee of the Minnesota Constitution (Clapp v Cox¬†et al. (No. 27-CV-22-12454)).The controversial contract was agreed to in March 2022 to end a 14-day teacher strike. The Minneapolis Federation of Teachers ratified the contract shortly after the agreement was reached. The Minneapolis Board of Education ratified it in May of this year.The Judicial Watch lawsuit states:Among other things, the contract provides preferences, protections, and privileges for MPS teachers of certain races and ethnicities under a section entitled ‚ÄúARTICLE 15. PROTECTIONS FOR EDUCATORS OF COLOR.‚Äù There is no similar provision covering educators who are not ‚Äúof color.‚ÄùUnder the contract, teachers of color are exempt from Defendant MPS‚Äôs seniority-based layoffs and reassignments, which means, when layoffs or reassignments occur, the next senior teacher who is not ‚Äúof color‚Äù would be laid off or reassigned. In addition, the contract mandates that Defendants reinstate teachers of color over more senior teachers who are not ‚Äúof color.‚ÄùUpon information and belief, prior to the contract, teachers were laid off or reassigned in order of seniority, with the least senior teachers laid off or reassigned first, without regard to race or ethnicity. Similarly, teachers were reinstated in order of seniority, with the more senior teachers reinstated first, without regard to race or ethnicity.Article 15‚Äôs preferences, protections, and privileges for certain public-school teachers on the basis of race and ethnicity violates Minnesota‚Äôs Equal Protection Guarantee, which states that ‚Äúno member of this state shall be disenfranchised or deprived of any of the rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof, unless by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers.‚Äù Minn. Const. art. 1, ¬ß 2. The Equal Protection Guarantee is analyzed under the same principles and mandate as the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.The lawsuit asks the court to enter a judgement that will declare that all actions taken to implement the racial and ethnic preference provisions of Article 15 of the contract to be illegal. They are also asking that the court declare it illegal to use any taxpayer dollars to implement these provisions of the contract, and the defendants be prohibited from taking any actions to implement these racial and ethnic provisions.‚ÄúIt is incredible that in this day and age a school system would engage in blatant racial discrimination in employing teachers,‚Äù stated Judicial Watch Tom Fitton. ‚ÄúThe courts can‚Äôt move soon enough to shut down this extreme leftist attack on the bedrock constitutional principle that no one can be denied equal treatment under law on account of race.‚ÄùJudicial Watch is being assisted in the lawsuit by Daniel N. Rosen of Rosen LLC in Minneapolis, Minnesota.In a separate case, the city of Asheville, NC, in January 2022 settled a Judicial Watch federal civil rights lawsuit after agreeing to remove all racially discriminatory provisions in a city-funded scholarship program. Additionally, the city also agreed to remove racially discriminatory eligibility provisions in a related program that provides grants to educators.In May 2022, Judicial Watch¬†won a court battle¬†against California‚Äôs gender quota law for corporate boards. The verdict came after a 28-day trial. The verdict followed a¬†similar ruling¬†in Judicial Watch‚Äôs favor in April finding California‚Äôs diversity mandate for corporate boards unconstitutional.TOPICS:Judicial WatchMINNEAPOLISMinneapolis Public SchoolsMinnesotanewsOANOANNpolitics SHARETWEETPINSHARE",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png,,https://www.oann.com/judicial-watch-files-taxpayer-lawsuit-over-racially-discriminatory-minneapolis-teachers-contract/

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 10:08 AM PT ‚Äì Tuesday, August 23, 2022The US State Department said it‚Äôs still on top of getting WNBA star Britney Griner released, five-months into her detention at a Russian prison.On Monday, spokesman Ned Price spoke out against reports indicating former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman was traveling to Russia to negotiate Griner‚Äôs release. Price went on to claim Rodman‚Äôs actions could complicate talks with Russia. The official urged the public to trust the Biden administration to get the job done.However, the State Department has allowed A former New Mexico governor to negotiate the releases of Trevor Reed from Russia and other Americans held captive in Myanmar. This occurred despite them not being employed by the US government for more than 20 years. Additionally, late last year, the Biden administration was criticized by families of Americans detained abroad for not even being able to get meetings with White House officials.Despite this, Price reiterated the tried and true method will work. He stressed, no unofficial envoy will bypass the efforts of US diplomats.‚ÄúI want to be clear, he is, he would not be traveling on behalf of the US government,‚Äù said the spokesman. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just reiterated what we‚Äôve said now for the past several weeks. We put forward a substantial proposal to Russia to seek the freedom of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. We believe that anything other than negotiating further through the established channel is likely to complicate and hinder those release efforts. We‚Äôve also provided very clear guidance to American citizens owing to a number of threats, not the least of which is the threat of wrongful detention that Americans should not travel to Russia. That has been our message to private Americans across the board.‚ÄùNBC News reported over the weekend that Rodman had told the outlet he was going to travel to Russia this week. Rodman has been known to hold informal talks with leaders who are at odds with the Washington establishment.His relationship with North Korea‚Äôs Kim Jong-un paved the way for talks between the nation and the Trump administration in 2018 that were seen as the first sign of hope that North Korea could lay down its nuclear arms in years. Rodman said at the time, he was going to keep pushing for peace with America‚Äôs adversary, despite being criticized by past administrations and mainstream media outlets.In the meantime, Giner faces nine-years in prison after being found with hashish oil in her possession at a Russian airport, while retired Marine Paul Whelan has been incarcerated in 2018 on allegations of spying. Diplomats are offering to exchange arms dealer Viktor Bout in a prisoner swap to bring the two Americans home.Meanwhile, critics of the Biden administration are calling out officials for paying this much attention to Griner, pointing out Joe Biden and Kamala Harris led efforts to incarcerate massive amounts of Americans for similar crimes.","Former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman arrives at Singapore‚Äôs Changi Airport on Tuesday, June 12, 2018.

On Monday, attorneys for Cruz attempted to look into why the 23-year-old murdered 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.Specifically, the defense highlighted his birth mother‚Äôs abuse of drugs and alcohol during pregnancy while claiming this contributed to Cruz‚Äôs actions.

McCabe, OAN National CorrespondentUPDATED 7:31 AM PT ‚Äì Tuesday, August 23, 2022(JACKSONVILLE, FLA.)¬† The Republican governor of Florida ended his day-long Education Agenda tour of the Sunshine State Sunday at a rally for supporters at The Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center here, where he urged them to back April Carney and Joyce Charlotte in the Aug. 23 Duval County school board election.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember ideology being injected into my school. I just learned basic subjects, but now you have a situation in which so many people, they want to use our school system not to educate kids, they want to indoctrinate kids,‚Äù said Gov. Ronald D. DeSantis, in front of hundreds of local conservative activists.‚ÄúYou saw us do that by passing a curriculum transparency legislation that I signed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI guess it was probably about four or five months ago at this point, guaranteeing the right of every parent in Florida to know what‚Äôs being taught to their kids in school, to know what textbooks are being used. You‚Äôd think that would be a no-brainer?‚ÄùThe governor toured the state for his school board candidates because he and Sen. Marco Rubio (R.-Fla.) have no primary opponents, while there is top of ticket ballot fights¬†on the Democratic side. The fear is that Republican turnout will suffer, so the governor went on the road to whip up the base.DeSantis said the key to his education agenda is to restore parental rights and to protect children from leftwing indoctrination, and the predatory sexualization of the curriculum.The governor said the woke ideology is so embedded in the education establishment that the state‚Äôs education recently rejected math textbooks, because they wove leftist lessons into the math lessons.‚ÄúTwo plus two equals four. It‚Äôs not two plus two and how does that make you feel? Or is that an injustice?‚Äù he said.Democrats assumed that when they called upon their leftwing allies in the big corporations, like Disney to put pressure on DeSantis, he would cave would not sign the Parental Rights in Education bill, he said.‚ÄúI think they thought, well, if you have somebody like Disney involved coming down against it, then obviously that‚Äôs going to be very difficult, and that‚Äôs going to be very difficult for the Governor to step up and sign it,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúWell, they thought wrong when it came to the state of Florida,‚Äù he said.DeSantis said leftists and their corporate allies also thought they could stop him from protecting women‚Äôs sports from males competing against them.‚ÄúYou had a lot of corporations that were virtue signaling about protecting women‚Äôs sports,‚Äùhe said.‚ÄúEven the NCAA was saying, hey, any state that protects women‚Äôs sports, we‚Äôre not going to hold events in that state,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúMy view is, go ahead.
