Trump holds rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 4:48 PM PT – Sunday, September 4, 2022The 45th President of the United States has held his first rally after his private residence was raided by Joe Biden’s FBI. On Saturday in Wilkes-Barre, Donald J. Trump laid out to Pennsylvanians just how high the stakes are in November.“This election is a referendum on skyrocketing inflation, rampant crime, soaring murders, crushing gas prices, millions and millions of illegal aliens pouring across our border, race and gender indoctrination perverting our schools, and above all this election is a referendum on the corruption and extremism of Joe Biden and the radical Democrat Party,” Trump stated to a roaring crowd. Donald Trump then proceeded to slam Joe Biden for visiting Philadelphia, where he declared that half of the voters in the Country are anti-American extremists. In a direct rebuke to Biden’s rhetoric, Trump said MAGA Republicans are not the threat to democracy but rather that they are the people who are trying to save it. He slammed the Democrats by saying they are the pre-eminent threat to democracy. Trump said the raid on his private residence in Florida put the US in third world nation territory.“On a phony pretext, getting permission from a highly political magistrate, who they handpicked late in the evening just days before the break in and trampled upon my rights and civil liberties as if our Country that we love so much were a 3rd world nation,” the Republican said.The 45th President held nothing back when telling the American people the real reason why Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) January’ sixth committee and why Fani Willis’s (D-Ga.) grand jury are allowed to continue. The media didn’t escape the President’s scorn either. Trump implicated them in the destruction of everything that made America great in the first place.“But this battle is not about me,” Trump confessed. “This is a struggle for the very fate of our republic. Our movement is fighting against a corrupt group of unelected tyrants who believe they can wield absolute power over you with the help of a willing and very corrupt media.”According to Trump, pollsters have revealed that if the FBI did not cover up the Hunter Biden laptop story, he would have remained in office. “It made a 10-20 point difference, not even including all the other totally determinative evidence of illegality that was found, having to do with the 2020 Presidential election scam, including ballot stuffing and not adhering to the laws, rules, and regulations of state legislatures, which is totally illegal,” the President said. He said that the MAGA movement is bigger than ever before, as evidenced by just how many more votes he gained between the 2016 and 2020 elections.“And likewise getting many more votes than — think about it. There’s never been a President, a sitting President, get anywhere near — I think we got like 10 million more votes than Obama got, Obama,” Trump remarked. “Ya know? So popular.”To close out his speech the 45th President said that the US belongs to the citizenry and not to powerful leftists in government.“We will never allow anyone to forget that this nation does not belong to them,” he promised. “This nation belongs to you…” “And we will make America Great Again! Thank you very much, God bless you all! Thank you Pennsylvania, thank you.”","Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Saturday, Sept. 3, 2022.

Don Young, who held the job for 49 years. (AP Photo/Mark Thiessen)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:26 PM PT – Sunday, September 4, 2022For the first time in half a century, a Democrat is representing Alaska’s at-large seat in Washington, D.C.. In August’s special election to fill the remainder of the late Don Young’s (R-Alaska) term, Democrat Mary Peltola pulled about 40-percent of first preference votes compared to former Governor Sarah Palin’s (R-Alaska) 31-percent and Republican Nick Begich’s 29-percentBegich was dropped in the subsequent round of counting preferences. Those who chose him as their first preference had their second preferences redistributed to the remaining candidates. About half of Begich’s voters chose Palin as their second choice and over a quarter chose Peltola. However, due to the distribution of Begich voters second choice and how well Peltola did with first preferences, she was able to eke out a less than three-point victory over second place Palin.Under Alaska’s ranked choice voting, all candidates run in an open primary. The top four performing candidates go on to fight in the ranked choice general election. At the general election, voters are given the option to rank those four candidates by preference. If a majority votes for one candidate in the first round, then the winner is declared without preferences being counted. However, if nobody can hit that 50-percent plus one margin then the poorest performing candidate is dropped and their voters second preferences are redistributed to the remaining candidates. These rounds of counting go on until someone wins a majority.Alaska is the second state to adopt ranked choice for federal elections. It was first done in Maine back in 2018. 45th President Donald Trump won one of the States electoral votes under the system during the 2020 election.With Alaska’s general election fast approaching, many in Conservative media fear that the State’s voting system could very well hand Democrats another victory for a full term in the House and give anti-Trump Republican Lisa Murkowski another term in the Senate. Jack Posobiec, Senior Editor at Human Events spoke on the topic.“You will always see Democrats or soft conservatives, soft Republicans, your one of fours, or even your four of fours who are more establishment types, they will put Murkowski as their second choice so she’ll pick up a larger swathe of voters,” Posobiec said. “Meanwhile, a MAGA Conservative is never going to say they want a Democrat as their second choice.”While a quarter of moderate Begich supporters did give their preference to Peltola over Palin, the 11,000 who failed to rank further candidates preferenced about two-to-one for Palin like the rest did. However, Palin can still be headed to Washington with a slim majority of the vote. The system was originally pushed for by Murkowski donors and staffers. They assumed it would save the unpopular Senator once again from the wrath of Conservative Alaskans. While that could still prove true, if Republicans take full advantage of the system in November by ranking their preferences instead of exhausting their ballots, not only could Murkowski be defeated but Palin could wrangle the seat out of Democrat hands.Murkowski’s top opponent, Trump endorsed Kelly Tshibaka, believes that the majority of Alaskans have never supported the Senator. In fact, Murkowski has never won a majority of the votes in any election she’s been in. According to Tshibaka, this combined with ranked choice voting could prove to be Murkowski’s ultimate undoing.","Former Alaska Gov.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:06 PM PT – Sunday, September 4, 2022Ohio Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance is hoping to best Democrat Representative Tim Ryan for the coveted seat to go to Capitol Hill. The seat that the two men are fighting for is being vacated by Republican Senator Rob Portman. Portman announced his retirement in January.The Hillbilly Elegy author rose to fame when his best-selling book hit the top in 2016. Analysts say his book was a window into rural Americans. The novel also explained why Ohio swung for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Since then, the venture capitalist has been a thought leader. Vance speaks on the long-forgotten working class American and he has appeared on multiple news outlets sharing his commentary.During the highly contested primary election this cycle, the Republican was able to win over former President Trump. Vance’s opponent on the other hand acts in lock-step with the Democrat party despite claiming he wants to fight for the working class.I want to look people in the eye. I want them to see me, see my record, and see that we don't need another millionaire in the Senate. We need someone from a working class community like the one that raised me outside of Youngstown. pic.twitter.com/vTwefHA16A— Tim Ryan (@TimRyan) June 10, 2022Reports have revealed that Ryan has voted with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)  and Joe Biden 100-percent of the time. Vance on the other hand not only wants to hold his Democrat opponent’s feet to the fire, but he also wants to reform the Republican party.The Senate hopeful shared with One America’s Dan Ball the biggest issue he has with Ryan’s political evolution.“They pretend that they believe one thing when it’s like look the video clip is right there of you saying something two years ago,” Vance said. “For example, Tim Ryan, who I’m now running against, is trying to claim that he’s really supportive of Trump’s tariffs on the Chinese yet two, three years ago he was one of the biggest fighters against those tariffs. Look, you can have a change of opinion but at least be honest and admit that you believe something different and that the facts made you change your mind. I think when people try to pretend that they’re something they’re not, that’s when politicians get into trouble.”The Republican is capitalizing on this area of opportunity because he doesn’t think Ryan can represent the best interests of Ohio.","DELAWARE, OH – APRIL 23: J.D.

Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake slammed Joe Biden’s so-called Soul of America speech.On Thursday, in front of Independence Hall which was bathed in blood red lights, Biden, who was flanked on both sides by armed Marines, declared half of the nation’s voters to be a threat to democracy and to the republic itself.

She said that Biden seemed to hold many of his fellow citizens in complete contempt.“What I saw was somebody who is trying to divide this Country. I’m not sure what’s wrong with Joe Biden,” Lake remarked.  “I know he may have problems that we don’t know about, but what I saw with him was somebody who carries in his heart a great deal of disdain for a whole lot of really good American people.”Lake pointed a finger at Democrats who claim Trump and his Republican supporters are racist. She highlighted that her opponent in the race for Governor in Arizona has been convicted for being racist in her public life.“I’m running against a politician named Katie Hobbs, who is a twice-convicted racist,” Lake said. “Who we the people are paying her settlement for because she did not want to pay women and people of color what they were worth in the workforce.”When she opened up the floor for questions, Lake was asked by a Democrat friendly journalist about how she can claim to want unity while questioning if the 2020 election was the most secure in history..@KariLake to Reporter: “We’re going to bring back freedom of speech.

I was a journalist after 2016, and I distinctly remember many people just like you asking a lot of questions about the 2016 election results.”To close out, Lake was asked if she would concede if she loses to Katie Hobbs.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 7:23 AM PT – Tuesday, September 6, 2022The Biden administration has continued its crusade against the MAGA movement. The President appears to keep choosing divisiveness as he rails against Trump supporters.While speaking at a rally on Monday, Biden accused the MAGA movement of being anti-Semitic, comparing them to the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis. His remarks came in spite of him running on a campaign of being a “great unifier,” but has recently proved otherwise by calling America First Republicans semi-fascist and a threat to democracy.“But then we moved to this place where all of a sudden, the reason that made me run I decided was when you saw those people come out of the fields down in Virginia carrying torches, literally coming out of the fields, carrying torches with swastikas, chanting the same anti-Semitic bylaws chanted in literally the same anti-Semitic bile, chanted in Germany in the thirties by the Ku Klux Klan,” Biden stated. “And the guy that I beat in this last election, and when they asked what he thought, he said there were really fine people on both sides. This is something really wrong. Something is changing. “Meanwhile, in the city of Boston, Vice President Kamala Harris voiced her frustration at Republican states trying to maintain the integrity of their elections. These include measures that ban the use of ballot drop boxes and requiring voters to show some form of identification.“We travel to do the work of reminding folks that when they stood in those lines for four hours, when they had to find childcare to drop off their ballot, when they navigated the obstacles that certain states are putting up for them to have access to the vote, when they put in their order in 2020 for what they wanted,” Harris noted. “We gave them most of what they asked for, but we need to see it through.”However, Biden maintained that not all Republicans supported the America First agenda, referring to lawmakers such as Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who have been labeled as RINOs by 45th President Donald Trump.“I want to be very clear up front, not every Republican is MAGA Republican,” Biden stated. “Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with mainstream Republicans in my whole career, but the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards. Full of anger, violence, hate and division. But together, we can and we must choose a different path forward.”In the meantime, a red wave is expected to hit in this year’s midterm elections with many Trump-endorsed candidates competing to take control of Congress.","President Joe Biden listens as Vice President Kamala Harris speaks after meeting with leaders from Georgia’s Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, Friday, March 19, 2021, at Emory University in Atlanta.

A new poll by CBS News and YouGov found 64 percent of respondents believe America will see further rise in political violence in coming years. This compared to just 51 percent who expected an increase in political violence in January 2021.The Biden administration is now under fire for labeling Donald Trump supporters as “dangerous extremists,” which critics say fuels more political division. Republicans are asserting that Biden should work to solve the crises he created, instead of pitting Americans against one another.“I was stunned at how divisive this speech was last night,” said Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin (R) in regards to President Biden’s recent primetime address. “And at a time where people across America, I know in Virginia, are worried about some of the most basic issues: rising inflation and trying to make ends meet, crime and oh by the way education challenges. And it’s a time when, in fact, we’ve gotta focus on these issues and our President jumped out and was incredibly divisive, trying to pit Americans against one another.”Joe Biden is an anti-worker president: •Real wages are down•56% of Americans say their financial situation is getting WORSE•The average American has $11,000 LESS in savings than last yearBiden does not care about working Americans.— GOP (@GOP) September 6, 2022The poll also found only 10 percent of Americans expect political violence to subside moving forward.","President Joe Biden speaks outside Independence Hall, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2022, in Philadelphia.

Senate race among tightest polling racesFILE – Joe O’Dea, Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Michael Bennet, speaks during a primary election night watch party, late June 28, 2022, in Denver.  (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 3:42 PM PT – Monday, September 5, 2022As the midterms enter the final stretch, some races are catching experts by surprise with just how close they are. Colorado Senator Michael Bennet (D-Colo.)  faces a surprisingly strong election challenge in his bid to represent the Centennial State for another term. Bennet has represented Colorado as a Democrat since being first appointed to the seat in 2009.Among his top priorities, if he wins re-election, include pushing for the greater adoption of so-called green energy, gun control and passing the Equality Act. The Act would expand civil rights protections for gender identity. As well, he would like to end congress members being able to make stock trades. Bennet claimed it would help American democracy.“That’s why I’m fighting to ban members of congress from ever becoming lobbyists,” Bennet said. “Why I’m not taking a dime in corporate PAC money. And why I’m working to stop senators and congressmen from making personal stock trades.”His opponent is Republican Joe O’Dea, the owner of a construction business. O’Dea has worked his way from being a union carpenter to be where he is today. The top issues that O’Dea’s would like to see tackled in a new Republican majority include ending late-term abortions, stopping the defund the police movement in its tracks and he would like to unify Coloradans from across the political spectrum. He also wants to prioritize reversing the expansion of the IRS, which he blames Bennet for.“The last thing we need to do is spend more money,” O’Dea stated. “The bottom line is that that’s going to transcend down and it’s going to get carried by working Americans here and we’re going to end up paying for that.”The race was originally expected to have Bennet cruise to re-election. However, as the election has drawn closer O’Dea has closed the gap. It’s now leading to a toss-up. If O’Dea can snatch the seat from Bennet the Democrat path to a Senate majority would be significantly narrowed.Colorado sends a mail-in ballot to every registered voter in the weeks before election day. The State also allows in-person voting. Voters must return their ballots to a polling station prior to their closing at 7:00 PM on election day.","FILE – Joe O’Dea, Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Michael Bennet, speaks during a primary election night watch party, late June 28, 2022, in Denver.  (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)",https://d2pd5v545ww278.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WireAP_49f1fd06b042428786621133b4311495_16x9_992-777x437.jpg, Project Veritas Exposes Woke Curriculum At Trinity SchoolTOPICS:BennetColoradodemocratmidtermsnewsO'DeaOANOANNpoliticsre-electionRepublican SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/colo-senate-race-among-tightest-polling-races/

On Thursday, the latest episode of Secret Curriculum featured Jennifer Norris. She is the Director of Student Activities at Trinity School in New York City.In the video obtained by an undercover journalist, Norris stated that white male Republicans are unredeemable and need to be eliminated. The Director of Student Activities also boasted that she and other teachers sneak their personal beliefs in the curriculum. One example she provided included teaching children about social justice during detention.The director was very open that Republican views are not welcome at the school.“It’s a 300-year-old school, so I mean, clearly based on white supremacy and it was started in Trinity Church, which was built by slaves,” Norris said. “And they’re starting to grapple with the history of their school, I think people know… I mean, we’re not as left as I am, for sure but it’s definitely a school where Conservatives would not feel comfortable.”The Trinity School is an elite K-through-12th academy. The intuition charges almost $60,000 a year in tuition.","NATIONAL HARBOR, MD – FEBRUARY 28: James O’Keefe, an American conservative political activist and founder of Project Veritas, meets with supporters during the Conservative Political Action Conference 2020 (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union on February 28, 2020 in National Harbor, MD.
