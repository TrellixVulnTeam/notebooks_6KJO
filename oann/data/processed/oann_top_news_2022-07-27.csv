1:20 PM PT",Biden’s officials doing damage control ahead of recession numbers,"The Biden administration is downplaying concerns of a recession ahead of this week’s GDP numbers that are expected to show an economic downturn. In a statement Monday, the White House questioned how economists determine a recession while alleging the US economy is “transitioning” from ‘”fast growth” to steady and slow growth.Biden economic advisor Brian Deese: “We are seeing a slowing [economy], that is not only expected but necessary, as we operate through this transition.” pic.twitter.com/9wiJH8NP4Y— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 25, 2022The US GDP shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter and the Atlanta Fed expects it to fall another 2.1 percent in the second quarter. However, President Biden’s officials are claiming two quarters of negative growth does not indicate a recession although it does.

As a result, the US national debt surged above $30 trillion.“I think there is a very high likelihood of recession when we’ve been in this kind of situation before,” he stated. “Recession has essentially always followed when inflation has been high and unemployment has been low.”Summers said the US economy may face high inflation and no growth for a while.  The US government is set to release second quarter GDP figures later this week and if it is negative that would mean the country is officially in a recession.","Brian Deese, Assistant to the President and Director of the National Economic Council, speaks during a meeting where President Joe Biden appeared virtually with his economic team in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Friday, July 22, 2022.

Eventually, several patrons made their way over to confront the demonstrators. Arguing turned into shoving, mace was deployed by an Antifa member and then the group retreated away from the establishment entirely. Antifa activists are now making threats against bikers online.It’s not like Antifa is unfamiliar with physical confrontation.

A bipartisan group of senators, including Collins, released proposed changes July 20, to the Electoral Count Act, the post-Civil War-era law for certifying presidential elections that came under intense scrutiny after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election. (Ting Shen/Pool Photo via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:24 AM PT – Monday, July 25, 2022Forty-seven House Republicans joined every Democrat in backing codification of same-sex marriage, in turn, sending the bill to the Senate. Now in the upper chamber, the bill, which would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, codify interracial marriage and give legislative backing to the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision, could face an uphill battle to the 60 votes needed for passage.All 50 Democrats have announced their support for gay marriage with the onus falling squarely on 10 Republican senators to join them and send the bill to President Joe Biden’s desk. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has led Republican efforts to codify gay marriage while working closely with the Senates first openly lesbian member, Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, to try and secure the 10 GOP votes. Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Ohio’s Rob Portman and North Carolina’s Thom Tillis have also announced their support.If you are a Senator who supports marriage equality then you will support our bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act to protect this freedom and right for same-sex and interracial marriages. Let's stand together and protect the progress we have made.— Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) July 20, 2022However, even staunch conservatives are getting on board with the bill as Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson has announced his intention to vote ‘yes.’ He said that while he thinks the bill is unnecessary because overturning gay marriage would disrupt people’s lives in a way overturning abortion did not, he wouldn’t oppose its passage.“Unlike Roe v. Wade, this pretty well is settled law from the standpoint that people have relied on that and if you overturn it, that’s a big part of Stare Decisis, it would disrupt a lot of people’s lives,” Johnson stated. “Roe v. Wade was about affecting people in the future…as I look at that piece of legislation from the House right now, I don’t see any reason why I should oppose it.”Despite this, opposition still runs steep among some parts of the Senate Republican caucus. South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham has said that he would continue to support the Defense of Marriage Act passed in 1996 with majority support among both parties in both chambers and signed by Democrat President Bill Clinton.The Republican Whip in the Senate, Texas’ John Cornyn, who’s fresh off writing the latest anti-Second Amendment legislation with Democrats, has said he feels the issue is an unnecessary distraction because it’s already settled law.“I I think it’s a contrived issue because the Supreme Court’s decided the issue, so I don’t see any reason for the Congress to act,” he stated.Ted Cruz, Texas’ other Republican senator, along with a few others are also expected to vote ‘no.’ The rest of the caucus remains cagey about giving a direct answer on where they sit. Iowa’s Joni Ernst has said she needs time to review the legislation and Utah’s Mitt Romney believes the bill is unnecessary, but is looking into it.Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy didn’t say if he would support the bill, but did tell reporters he was amazed they fall for distractions by the Democrats listed off a litany of pressing issues facing the country from a wide open border to record inflation. He said the whole thing was to shift the media’s attention from those issues.With most Republicans not giving a firm answer one way or the other, it could be a bill with an unknown status until it comes to the floor for a full vote by the body. If it passes, Biden has said he will sign it the moment it gets to his desk. However, even if the bill fails, same sex marriage will still be the law of the land for the foreseeable future with Republican legislators and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh asserting the Obergefell decision isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.","FILE – Sen.

Speaking to Meet the Press on Sunday, the Virginian said she has become good friends with the Wyoming Rep. since working together on Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) January 6 committee. According to Luria, even if Cheney loses her primary her voice is vital for the future of the GOP.“I admire Liz Cheney,” Luria said. “I have been friendly with her ever since I came to Congress, even before we served on this committee together. I think that if she doesn’t come through this primary, come back to Congress, there are so many things that she could do in the future for our country.”While Democrats promote Cheney, Republicans have repudiated the Rep. to the highest degree. The Wyoming Republican Party has formally censured her and no longer recognizes her as a member of the party.“Her voice is absolutely needed,” Luria added. “And I think she’s one of unfortunately, a very small number of people who need to be the face of the Republican Party in the future. I would love to get back to where we had two political parties that debate on issues and facts and not lies. I really hope that Liz Cheney will continue, but I don’t want to speculate. She’s said herself she doesn’t know what her future plans will be.”Two profiles in courage: Liz Cheney & Elaine Luria.

(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:10 PM PT – Monday, July 25, 2022Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo confirmed that the Biden administration is considering lifting tariffs on China. In an interview Sunday, Raimondo said officials are looking at potential labor implications of lifting Trump-era tariffs on China. She added that tariffs could be lifted if it helps bring down inflation and alleviate supply chain problems.The Secretary also praised Biden’s so-called green agenda despite concerns it may further cripple US manufacturing. Despite an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that lifting tariffs on some Chinese-made products would save households hundreds of dollars, Biden is concerned about the support of unions in making this decision.“There are potential labor implications,” Raimondo stated. “One thing about this president is he will never do anything that he thinks will hurt workers in America or union workers in America.” Labor unions are actively campaigning against dropping tariffs on China with multiple groups filing an official comment to the Office of the US Trade Representative earlier this month to advocate for the tariffs to stay in place. Trump imposed numerous tariffs on China during his time in office. The former president believed that trading practices with the country were unfair to the US. The Biden administration has kept many of the tariffs in place despite indicating some of the policies need to be changed.“The labor market is now extremely strong,” she said. “This is not an economy that’s in recession, but we’re in a period of transition in which growth is slowing. And that’s necessary and appropriate, and we need to be growing at a steady and sustainable pace.”The Commerce Secretary herself advocated for dropping some of the tariffs, but there is no clear timeline on when the president will make a decision on the issue. Biden’s thinking could also be impacted by the midterm elections where union support is a big help to Democrats in a year where Republicans are expected to pick up multiple seats.The President is still weighing whether or not to lift tariffs off of China. The action potentially could have an impact on US inflation. @POTUS has said he plans to talk to China's Xi within days. https://t.co/mQq2r8jBU4— Margaret Brennan (@margbrennan) July 24, 2022Raimondo voiced that the Biden administration may restrict the exports of US technology to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.","Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington, D.C.

In an interview on Monday, Cotton said the Democrat-run panel has “no adversarial process” and it’s essentially denying due process to its targets.He stressed that there’s no one on the January 6 committee whose view of the Capitol protest would be different than Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.). Cotton voiced that the two Republicans on that committee are no different than Democrats in their assessments of those events.“There is no one on that committee who takes a view different from Nancy Pelosi or even a view that’s like we should examine the full context of all of these statements, of all of these recordings, of all of this video,” Cotton said. “We have no idea of the videos and the audio recordings and the testimony is being presented in its full context.”Hugh Hewitt, the host of the Hugh Hewitt Show asked him “What is the principal defect of this committee?”“That it has no adversarial process whatsoever,” he replied. “Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), the two Republicans, clearly share the views of the Democrats on the subject of the committee’s inquiry. If you had someone like Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) or Jim Banks (R-Ind.) on there, not only would they be privy to all the information, but they would be probing that information and probing witnesses to try to get at truth. Which is again what the Anglo-American legal system has done for centuries.”MAGA Republicans claim that the J6 committee hearings amount to a “show trial”. It’s a prosecutors brief with no one to speak for the other side, etc. Even some supporters of the committee say that in a way it is if not a show trial then a brief, a prosecutors argument.— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) July 23, 2022The Arkansas Senator emphasized that January 6 evidence presented by Democrats is mostly lacking context, while Pelosi has yet to release all video footage from the protest.","WASHINGTON, DC – OCTOBER 27: Sen.

At a press briefing Monday, State Department spokesman Ned Price condemned Myanmar’s government, which has been run by it’s military since a coup in 2021, for executing four pro-democracy activists.Secretary of State Antony Blinken also issued a statement, calling the actions irreprehensible while claiming it adds to the killing of more than 2,100 residents and 700,000 people displaced from their home country. Both Blinken and Price warned this only shows how far Myanmar’s government is disregarding human rights.﻿Earlier in the day, the country announced its first set of executions in nearly 50 years. Among the dead include veteran activist Ko Jimmy and former lawmaker Phyo Zeya Thaw who were charged and convicted last month of violating counterterrorism laws.  The other two activists were reportedly convicted of killing a woman alleged to be an informant for the military. Some humanitarian organizations have claimed these trials were not conducted fairly.“The depravity of the Myanmar military junta knows no bounds,” stated Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. “These are four political prisoners, they were brought up in front of a military tribunal that was a closed trial. Crimes against humanity is obviously not enough for the Myanmar military junta: now they are engaged in executing prisoners.”Meanwhile, other activists on the ground are lamenting the military’s increasingly brazen attacks on its civilian population. Some believe troops’ attempts to take out opposition forces are just to cement their power and eliminate any threat to it. Others say these attempts will be counterproductive and will only rally civilians behind the pro-democracy movement.“There will be more resistance,  this will escalate the revolution, including the urban guerrilla fighters,” said Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a Myanmar activist. “There will be more defensive war in different areas. This action is just like a call to war, a call for war to their own people.”In the meantime, the US State Department is calling on Myanmar’s military to cease further plans to execute civilians and is urging the international community to sanction Myanmar. Cambodia’s prime minister, who chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has condemned Myanmar’s behavior and is looking to solve the political crisis in Myanmar at a regional level.","Myanmar nationals living in Thailand hold the pictures of deposed Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi as they protest outside Myanmar’s embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, Tuesday, July 26, 2022.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:51 AM PT – Tuesday, July 26, 2022New York City Mayor Eric Adams sounded the alarm on the surge of illegal aliens coming to the Big Apple. During a press conference Sunday, Adams warned the city about the massive influx.One of his campaign priorities was standing up for “undocumented New Yorkers” by making sure NYC remained a “sanctuary city.” He doubled down on that promise by informing residents that right now “this is an all hands on deck” moment.﻿Adams went on to say residents must all be on board after asking the administration for help last week while calling the migrants a “real burden on New Yorkers.” Border towns are familiar with NYC’s plight as more than 3 million migrants have surged into the country since Joe Biden took office.Adams pleaded with the White House to provide aid to help accommodate the more than 2,800 people who recently entered the city’s shelter system. The Mayor was quick to blame migrants sent by Texas and Arizona, but also acknowledged federal migrant flights have contributed to the total sum. Adams listed a number of services for migrants he would like to be financed by federal tax dollars.Meanwhile, the Mayor of Arizona’s border town of Yuma, Douglas Nicholls, spoke with One America’s Alicia Summers to share his thoughts on the ongoing crisis.While Democrats continue to say Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s plan to bus illegal aliens from his state to Washington D.C. is purely political, proponents of the strategy have said it’s acting as intended. It grabs the attention of those who are seemingly blind to the events at the border.","FILE – Mayor Eric Adams speaks during a graduation ceremony at Madison Square Garden, on July 1, 2022, in New York.

The Indiana legislature is starting a special legislative session to address new abortion legislation and refunds to residents from the states budget surplus. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:23 AM PT – Tuesday, July 26, 2022The Biden administration deployed Kamala Harris to Indiana as the state becomes the first to hold a special session to discuss abortion laws. On Monday, Hoosier lawmakers discussed a bill that would ban abortions except in cases of rape or incest.KAMALA HARRIS: ""Women are getting pregnant every day in America, and this is a real issue."" pic.twitter.com/hWErnMztJf— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 24, 2022Indiana’s current abortion laws state the procedure is legal up to 22-weeks. Women also reportedly have to undergo an ultrasound and wait 18-hours before receiving the procedure. Supporters of the new restrictions stress they are not trying to “criminalize” women, but support them in “bringing healthy babies into the world.”“If government does not protect life, our first right, none of the other rights in the Bill of Rights matter,” said Nathaniel Mervar, a pro-life activist. “And for 50 years, this chamber has told us that we cannot abolish abortion because of Roe v. Wade. Now, Roe v. Wade has been overturned and yet there is no bill to ban abortion outright.”However, the Vice President accused proponents of the bill of not understanding biology. Harris broke with her party by exclusively using the word “woman” to describe someone who gets pregnant while claiming abortion is integral to women’s health.“And if you know how a woman’s body works, then you will understand that at the point that the vast majority of women realize they are pregnant, abortion will essentially be banned,” she stated.While speaking at a press conference in Indianapolis, Harris claimed abortion is both constitutional and compatible with any religious belief.“One does not have to abandon your faith or your beliefs to agree that the government should not be making this decision for her,” she noted.Harris’ respect for bodily autonomy did not apply to the unvaccinated as the Biden administration pushed for a private employer COVID-19 vaccine mandate last year.Indiana Rep. Jackie Walorski, a Republican, chastised Harris’ visit by calling it “out-of-touch” with the needs of Hoosiers. She argued that while inflation rages and gas prices soar, the Biden administration is focusing on its left-wing agenda.“As Indiana leads the nation in protecting women and defending life, Vice President Kamala Harris is radically out-of-touch with Hoosiers’ values and priorities,” Walorski stated. “Inflation is raging, gas prices are out of control, illicit fentanyl is killing our neighbors every day and yet, Kamala Harris will fly over the Heartland and ignore these Democrat-inflicted crises until it fits the Biden administration’s left-wing agenda. As we’ll see in November, Hoosiers aren’t buying what Biden and Harris are selling.” The chairman of Indiana’s Republican Party echoed these statements, saying there is no need of any Washington D.C. in Indiana.","Vice President Kamala Harris meets with Indiana Democratic legislators to discuss reproductive rights at the Indiana State Library in Indianapolis, Monday, July 25, 2022.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:51 AM PT – Tuesday, July 26, 2022White House Chief Medical Adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci is recommending Americans get another booster shot for the latest variant of COVID-19. In an exclusive with The Hill on Monday, he said getting the jab is hi “best guess” at beating the new variant.His comments come as the BA.5 is the most widespread variant currently causing infections. In the meantime, Dr. Fauci claimed the FDA will likely approve booster shots for this new variant by the fall. This comes despite studies showing natural immunity is longer lasting than vaccine immunity.“There’s always the possibility that you’re going to have the evolution of another variant and hopefully if that occurs it will vary off from the BA.5 only slightly in the sense of being a sub-sub-lineage of it and not something entirely different,” said Dr. Fauci.The NIAID director has continued to defend COVID-19 vaccine mandates. He was asked why vaccines are still mandated in many places when he himself was quoted as saying that everyone would come into contact with COVID and most would contract it anyway. Dr. Fauci said vaccines, particularly boosters, prevent progression of the disease to hospitalization as the reason for the continued push.Dr. Fauci, who tested positive for the virus twice, also praised his Paxlovid regimen as he said it gave him a relatively mild disease. Meanwhile, the President’s physician said Joe Biden’s COVID symptoms are almost completely resolved. Dr. Kevin O’Connor gave the update Monday in a letter to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.President Trump gets #COVID:“It’s the end of the world!” Fauci and Biden get COVID:“No big deal.”— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) July 25, 2022O’Connor said the President is experiencing nasal congestion and hoarseness, but other than that his pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature remain normal. Biden completed his fourth treatment of Paxolvid and will continue taking the medication as planned. He will also continue to isolate according CDC recommendations.According to reports from governments around the world, people who received the COVID vaccines are suffering far more injuries and deaths than those who didn’t.

A 37-year-old woman fired several gunshots, apparently at the ceiling, inside of Dallas’ Love Field Airport on Monday before an officer shot and wounded her, authorities said. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:10 PM PT – Monday, July 25, 2022Authorities are investigating a shooting which prompted evacuations at Dallas Love Field Airport. The FAA ordered a ground stop at the airport shortly after 11 a.m. local time due to the active shooter situation. Dallas Chief of Police Eddie Garcia said 37-year-old Portia Odufuwa began firing a handgun and a police officer engaged the suspect. He claimed that the woman entered the airport and went into a restroom to change clothes. Garcia expressed that the woman exited the restroom wearing a hoody and opened fire. Most of the shots appeared to be directed toward the ceiling.“At this point, we don’t know where exactly the individual was aiming,” Garcia stated. “From what we are seeing she was aiming at the ceiling. There are several rounds that were found.”An officer working inside confronted Odufuwa and shot her in her lower extremities. The suspect was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in an unknown condition. No further information about her or the motivation behind the shooting or who dropped her off at the airport has been confirmed by police. There were no other injuries.The investigation is ongoing and Garcia said he expected elements to change as more is learned about what happened. Dallas Police said they do not plan to release any other statements until Tuesday afternoon. The Dallas FBI and ATF are assisting Dallas Police in the investigation.The shooting wasn’t the first violent incident at the airport. In 2016, a police officer shot and wounded a man outside of Love Field after police said he advanced toward the officer with large landscaping rocks in his hands after battering his ex-girlfriend’s car with a traffic cone and rocks as she dropped him off at the airport.“I’m thankful to the Dallas Police Department, the Transportation Security Administration and the dedicated Love Field staff for their swift response in keeping people safe,” City Council member Jesse Moreno voiced. “This is something they do every day for people who travel to and from Dallas.”Earlier I spoke with an eye witness who described what he and his wife saw inside at the ticketing counter.  They said a woman said she was going to, “Make an announcement” then they saw her pull out a gun. @NBCDFW pic.twitter.com/KSzsma0iJY— Sophia Beausoleil (@SophiaNBC5) July 25, 2022Inside Dallas Love Field, swarms of passengers wait for TSA to open back up following the airport shooting. pic.twitter.com/NAiJTe1Oge— Markie Martin (@MarkieMartin) July 25, 2022Flights bound for the airport were temporarily delayed during the incident.","A traveler makes her way past emergency responders standing outside the ticketing and check in area at Dallas Love Field in Dallas, Monday, July 25, 2022.
