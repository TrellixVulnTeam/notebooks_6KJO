He revealed his colleagues hate the idea of Musk purchasing Twitter.“Twitter does not believe in free speech,” said Murugesan. “Elon believes in free speech.”The Twitter engineer voiced how his coworkers did everything they could to disrupt Musk’s purchase. He described Twitter’s workplace culture as “socialist” after seeing coworkers get away with taking a month off of work at a time.“In Twitter, it’s like mental health is everything,” Murugesan stated. “If you are not feeling it you can take some time off, people have taken months off.”Murugesan claimed both liberals and conservatives cannot co-exist on Twitter, but ultimately admitted that Musk makes good points at times. The Tesla CEO has stated that work ethic expectations at Twitter will be extreme, but not less than what he demands of himself.","FILE – The Twitter application is seen on a digital device, Monday, April 25, 2022, in San Diego.

(Anders Wiklund/TT News Agency via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:14 AM PT – Tuesday, May 17, 2022The Senate has advanced the $40 billion aid package for Ukraine. In an 81-to-11 vote Monday, the upper chamber overwhelmingly moved to put the measure to a final vote. The 11 senators who voted ‘no,’ including Tennessee Republican Bill Hagerty, expressed concerns of putting the war in Ukraine above American interests.The measure easily passed in the House, but was single handedly stalled in the upper chamber by Kentucky Sen, Rand Paul last week. The Republican said lawmakers must install a special inspector general to oversee how the Ukraine military aid is spent. Paul explained that his oath of office “is to the national security of the United States of America.”“The US is trying to recover from the $1.6 trillion we spent on wars in the Middle East,” he stated. “Not to mention the $5 trillion borrowed for COVID. We should not forget that the Soviet Union collapsed in large part, not because it was defeated militarily, but because it ran out of money.”The lower chamber had passed the legislation in a 368-to-57 vote last week, just hours after the bill’s official text was released. All 57 opponents of the spending spree were Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) praised the bill’s passing as a monumental for a crisis that has raged for the past three months.“We should all be very proud that we had the opportunity when (Vladimir) Putin decided whatever it is he decided, to be brutal and cruel and a coward, that we were there to help,” stated the top Democrat. “It’s about democracy versus a dictatorship.”The aid is supposedly split evenly between military and humanitarian efforts with billions of dollars going towards training Ukrainian troops, replenishing weapons stores, propping up the Ukrainian economy and aiding refugees in the US.The bill is $7 billion more than President Joe Biden’s initial request and will put the American aid to Ukraine up to $54 billion since the war first began. With its passing, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) claimed the latest push will bring the crisis closer to a conclusion.“This bill ensures that we are one step closer to making them pay the full price for their actions,” she stated. “And in the process, we will be standing firmly with the Ukrainian people while combating the exploitation of Ukraine’s vulnerable financial system.”Biden and the Democrat Party initially wanted to tie the package in with additional funding to combat COVID. However, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-K.Y.) had pledged to stand in the way of the bill’s passage unless COVID relief funds were dropped.I got to meet with Ukrainian Ambassador Markarova to discuss Ukraine's brave fight.

Biden gave the award to the 2020 and 2021 classes after the COVID-19 pandemic postponed both ceremonies.The Medal of Valor is the highest honor a public safety officer can receive for performing acts of heroism.“Today is an important day for the nation to give thanks for all that you do for everybody, for all of us,” Biden said. “Because of COVID-19 we couldn’t have this special ceremony for the past two years, but I’m honored that we finally can today. Fifteen public safety officers from eight different departments with a Medal of Valor, the highest award a president can bestow on a public safety officer.”The recipients of the award included nine police officers and six fire fighters. One recipient was a North Carolina police officer who tragically passed away after saving a woman during a hostage situation in a busy retail area.“You’re the heart and soul and the very spine, very spine of this country and your communities,” he proclaimed. “Each one of you from small town departments to big cities, you’re cut from the same cloth. You possess a selflessness that’s really hard to explain. A rare commitment to your neighbors and your fellow Americans, an unusual bravery that inspires everyone and you’ve been singled out because of your extraordinary heroism.”Today, I awarded the Medal of Valor to 15 public safety officers – including two who died in the line of duty.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 11:19 AM PT – Tuesday, May 17, 2022A severe outbreak of bird flu has continued to hit bird farms across the nation. On Monday, Pennsylvania reported the thirteenth farm in the state had been affected by the outbreak, which has now hit over 4 million birds in the Keystone State alone.In Iowa, a turkey farmer described the outbreak as extremely severe. He said it’s worse than a similar outbreak in 2015 because despite having to kill two-thirds of the birds back then, he didn’t really know what was happening. However, now he knows exactly how it will play out. The farmer said he doesn’t think humans are in danger because of the outbreak.“I don’t think it’s a human threat because a lot of people don’t have the chickens and stuff inside their house or anything like that,” explained farmer rad Moline. “They are outside or they’re out in well ventilated barns and stuff, so I think the human threat is very, very low.”Unfortunately, when commercial breaks occur, it impacts more birds than in the backyard flocks. As of May 13, 628,300 commercial poultry have been lost this month to #birdflu, as opposed to 1,892 birds in backyard flocks.

Wade.On Sunday, Oklahoma’s Republican Governor Kevin Stitt said that he was excited for the state to enforce its fetal heartbeat law, which bans all abortions after a heartbeat can be detected. This usually occurs around six weeks into pregnancy.“I represent 4 million Oklahomans,” said Stitt. “We believe life begins at conception and we’re going to protect life in Oklahoma. There were 5,000  just in Oklahoma alone. Five-thousand unborn children that were killed last year and we don’t believe in that in Oklahoma. Other states can do things differently.”Oklahoma abortion law wont be able to be enforced everywhere in the state. Much of the state is controlled by sovereign Native American tribes who can set their own rules for their territory.“The tribes in Oklahoma are super liberal,” Stitt expressed. “We think that there’s the possibility that some tribes may try to set up abortion on demand.”He was sparse on the details of what he wants to do, but he did say he wants protection for “pre-born babies” to be strengthened as much as possible. There is no exception for rape or incest in the law.I am proud to sign SB 1503, the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act into law.I want Oklahoma to be the most pro-life state in the country because I represent all four million Oklahomans who overwhelmingly want to protect the unborn. pic.twitter.com/XQr7khRLRa— Governor Kevin Stitt (@GovStitt) May 3, 2022The court is expected to release its official opinion before the end of June.","Oklahoma Gov.

The White House released a statement over the weekend, which announced Biden and the First Lady will visit the city on Tuesday to grieve with the mourning community.Jill and I pray for the victims, their families and devastated community from yesterday’s mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. Our hearts are heavy once again but our resolve must not waver; we must work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of this nation.— President Biden (@POTUS) May 15, 2022Biden addressed the shooting on Sunday and assured the Justice Department is investigating the incident as a hate crime. He also praised the actions of law enforcement and offered condolences to the victims as well as their families. Ten people lost their lives during the attack.  He also called on Americans to do everything in their power to end “hate-fueled domestic terrorism.”Meanwhile, New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) said CEOs of social media companies should be held accountable for certain crimes. During an interview Sunday, the Democrat said these chief executives need to assure the public that they are taking every step possible to monitor risky information.Her remarks came after the suspected shooter reportedly posted a 180 page manifesto online, just one day before opening fire at the Buffalo supermarket. The act of violence left 10 people dead while the attack was live streamed for an online audience to witness.“Well this manifesto tells everything to us and that is what is so bone-chiling about it,” stated the governor. “There is the ability for people to write and subscribe to such philosophies filled with hate and white supremacist acts of terrorism that are being fermented on social media, and to know that what this one individual did has been shared with the rest of the world.”Hochul said violent hate messages need to be monitored and shut down the moment they are exposed. Meanwhile, the suspected gunman from the Buffalo shooting has been charged.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:15 AM PT – Wednesday, May 18, 2022Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) berated his Democrat colleagues for reckless spending while forcing the American people to foot the bill. While addressing the Senate floor Tuesday, the Kentuckian evoked the memory of economic prosperity under Republican leadership.“In early 2020, before the pandemic, Republicans helped create one of the best economic moments for working Americans literally in out lifetimes,” McConnell stated. “Unemployment was low, inflation was low and real take-home pat was rising steadily. In fact, we had wages rising faster for the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale than for the top 25 percent.”The Minority leader noted, the COVID pandemic caused an artificial speed bump for the American economy. He claimed the incoming Democrat government had been set up for success in January of last year as much of the private sector was reopening and COVID vaccines were readily available. However, the long serving senator lamented the political left snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and squandered the good position they had inherited.“But through their far-left policy choices, Washington Democrats have driven our economy right into the ground,” he asserted. “Inflation is setting 40-year records in consecutive months, gas and diesel prices have set new all-time highs on consecutive days, and sticker shock continues to cause headaches for Americans buying household essentials.”Gas prices are now the highest they have ever been in American history. Americans are now paying roughly $4.40 per gallon. That’s up about two whole dollars from when President Biden put his hand on the Bible.— Leader McConnell (@LeaderMcConnell) May 11, 2022McConnell recounted tales from around the country of people scrounging to support themselves amid steep price hikes. From taking out loans to afford food to visiting multiple stores for the lowest prices, the Republican highlighted the various ways Americans have grappled with the 10 percent rise in grocery costs in the past year. However, he accused Democrats of treating government spending as the only solution, which he said is exacerbating the problem.“Fewer than one-in-four American consumers say that this current economic conditions are even ‘somewhat good’ and fewer than one-in-five say the Biden administration’s policies haven’t done anything to help,” McConnell continued. “Democrats made runaway reckless spending their new normal here in Washington. So historic, painful inflation has become the new normal for working families everywhere else.”Despite chastising Democrats for excessive spending, the Minority Leader has been instrumental in drumming up Republican support to advance the $40 billion Ukraine bill in the Senate.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door policy lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, May 17, 2022.

The first hearing with top pentagon officials in half a century revealed the number of UAPs, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, reported by pilots and service members had grown to about 400 incidents. This is up from 143 from just a year ago.Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, Ronald S. Moultrie said transparency was important. He also said the goal was to find out what’s out there, in addition to keeping US military and bases safe.“We know that our service members have encountered unidentified aerial phenomenon,” Moultrie stated. “And because UAPs pose potential flight safety and general security risks, we are committed to a focused effort to determine their origins.”Other Pentagon officials stressed, the UAPs found do not appear to be of extraterrestrial origin. However, they recognized they have seen unauthorized and or unidentified aircraft since the early 2000s. Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence, Scott Bray proceeded to show a video example showing an observation in real time.“Any given observation may be fleeting or longer,” he explained. “It may be recorded or not. It may be observable by one or multiple assets. In short, there’s rarely an easy answer.”Full resolution of metallic UAP/UFO cockpit video shown publicly in today’s congressional hearing.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:16 PM PT – Tuesday, May 17, 2022GOP lawmakers lament President Joe Biden is letting the economy spiral out of control at the expense of small business owners.On Monday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a round table conference with representatives and business owners to discuss what’s going wrong with Biden’s approach to the economy.He stressed the President’s massive spending proposals and mismanagement of the federal government has led to the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. McCarthy added, as a former small business owner, he couldn’t imagine trying to operate during and after a pandemic.“You just came out of a pandemic hoping it would be better,” the congressman stated. “And then you’ve got high regulations, higher gas prices, and in a small business you really learn the economic responsibility but you can’t just keep spending money. That’s what the government has been doing, propelling inflation along the way.”Congresswoman Maria Salazar (R-Fla.) went on to say inflation is “killing the American dream.” She noted one-in-five small businesses in the country are created by minorities and around 70 percent of Miami businesses are minority owned. She claims the rising cost of raw materials and restrictive laws are making running those businesses more difficult.“All this is doing is killing the American dream,” said Salazar. “Because the American dream for an immigrant is to create your small business.”Additionally, the business owners detailed the cost of soaring gas and food prices, which have caused them to raise the price of their goods..@RepFeenstra: “There’s a lot of fear right now in the breadbasket to the world” because of President Biden’s failed policies. pic.twitter.com/8Rp3H0KGvF— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) May 16, 2022Though these changes are driving customers away, they believe Americans are waking up to extreme leftist policies and will come out to vote for Republicans in the midterms.","FILE – House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., speaks to reporters at his weekly news conference, at the Capitol in Washington, March 18, 2022.
