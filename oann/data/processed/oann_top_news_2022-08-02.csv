Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) dismissed Democrat claims on their latest reconciliation package proposal.Tonight, the Senate voted to give us the chance to fix a completely unnecessary budget gimmick in the underlying text of the PACT Act. This gimmick allows $400B in spending completely unrelated to veterans care. pic.twitter.com/TAuE12G8l0— Senator Pat Toomey (@SenToomey) July 27, 2022During an interview on Sunday, Toomey called the bill “a gimmick.” He expressed his doubts, saying that it would increase revenue while lowering the deficit. He contended that any debt reduction from the legislation over the next 10 years would be wiped out if Democrats don’t end Obamacare subsidies for wealthy Americans.Toomey also said that he believes the bill will make inflation worse and that the corporate tax hikes included in the legislation would hurt the economy.“They’re also counting huge amounts of additional tax revenue from giving more taxes, money to the IRS, which the CBO does not agree with,” explained the Republican lawmaker. “They’re also not taking into account how much our economy will slow down from this big corporate tax increase that will mostly hurt manufacturing and domestic investment. These numbers are very, very dubious.”Toomey also stated that moderate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was “taken to the cleaner”’ when agreeing to support the reconciliation proposal.","Sen.

The incident is under investigation for local law enforcement’s delay in responding to the attack.During her time in the hospital, Mayah was visited by country singer Kevin Fowler earlier this month after her family was unable to attend his concert due to her extensive injuries. Hospital staff reached out to Fowler on Mayah’s behalf and asked him to stop by.

REUTERS/ Ann SaphirPresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Neel Kashkari said Democrats are responsible for economic problems facing the US. In an interview Sunday, Kashkari pointed out that Biden’s officials falsely denied that inflation would get out of hand and now they are trying to change the definition of a recession.“People don’t wait to hear from the media that they’re in a recession,” said Kashkari. “Most peoples pay checks are not going as far as it used to and that is true. They’re going to think this is a recession, they’re going to think this is a bad economy and they’re hold the party in power accountable. This administration I think has consistently played politics of the economy badly.”""We would love it if we can transition to a sustainable economy without tipping the economy into recession. There's not a great record of doing that.""Neel Kashkari, Minneapolis Fed Bank president, said we are ""a long way away"" from an economy that is back at 2% inflation. pic.twitter.com/F8Mb7Bm6Ke— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) August 1, 2022The central banker said administration officials should not have done that and they should have admitted responsibility instead. He added that the US economy is not doing well.“First in denying that inflation was going to happen, denying that it was going to stick around and now getting into this absurd definitional argument about whether we are in a recession or not,” he stated.Kashkari went on to say that the fed’s goal is to get inflation to below two percent however they can.","FILE PHOTO: Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari poses during an interview with Reuters in his office at the bank’s headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., January 10, 2020.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:20 PM PT – Monday, August 1, 2022Congressman James Comer (R-Ky.) said he’s looking into Hunter Biden’s questionable foreign dealings. In a recent interview, the Kentucky Congressman said several banks flagged at least 150 financial transactions involving Hunter as suspicious.“Text messages show that Hunter Biden was aware of these SARs and took steps to avoid detection in his financial dealings,” Comer noted.The GOP lawmaker explained this only happens when the bank has solid reasons to believe their client is involved in criminal activity. He added, the Biden administration may be running a cover-up for Hunter.House Oversight Committee Republicans have been investigating the scandal-scarred first son’s domestic and foreign business relationships as well as any effort to benefit from his father. According to the GOP members, the SARs raise “serious questions about what these transactions were for and whether money was transferred to the Biden family from America’s adversaries.”🚨NEW🚨@RepJamesComer presses Hunter Biden’s financial advisor, Edward Prewitt, for information about the Biden family’s foreign business deals that have triggered suspicious activity reports.The American people deserve to know. https://t.co/UwTOzV2uyK— Oversight Committee Republicans (@GOPoversight) July 27, 2022“Committee Republicans are committed to following Hunter Biden’s money trail consisting of many complex, international transactions worth millions of dollars,” stated Comer. “The American people deserve to know the President’s connections to his son’s business deals, which have occurred at the expense of American interests and may represent a national security threat.”According to the Kentucky Congressman, Edward Prewitt and his firm managed the accounts of the first son’s businesses, including Owasco PC, Owasco LLC, Skaneateles and Rosemont Seneca Advisors. They also managed a Hudson West, which has reprotedly been used in transferring millions of dollars to Hunter and James Biden from CEFC. This company has been said to be “effectively an arm of the Chinese government.”WATCH: @RepJamesComer shares new details on the Biden Crime Family:“A suspicious activity report is when the bank notifies the federal government that they have a strong suspicion of criminal activity by their client…Hunter Biden received at least 150 of these.” pic.twitter.com/KnxFXhs5Xe— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) July 30, 2022“You have an obligation to the country to take these allegations seriously, immediately investigate and take steps to institute fixes to these and other matters before you,” the senator voiced to the Biden administration officials.​Comer also said his Oversight Committee is focused on investigating Hunter Biden. The probe is expected to intensify if Republicans take back the House in November.","House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep.

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 12:10 PM PT – Monday, August 1, 2022The farmer protests have continued in the Netherlands and many are saying Americans should start paying more attention. As tensions rise between farmers and the government in the country, the impacts are being felt across the globe.“I don’t know what could be more essential to communism than that,” said Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a legal philosopher. “So, you know, it’s communism and I’m saying it’s being done on a global scale because this is part of a bigger agenda than just the agenda of the Dutch government.”This week, farmers continued to fight the government’s plans to cut nitrogen emissions by restricting livestock and fertilizer use so heavily that it will send many farms out of business. These plans come after a court ruled the initial emissions plan violated EU laws protecting endangered plants and animals, which caused the Dutch government to target their own farmers.“Yes it’s true that the Dutch government wants the farmers land,” the philosopher voiced. “For one reason is to house new immigrants, but this is also because they are following an agenda called the 2030 agenda. These are restrictions and climate regulations that are imposed all over the world. We’re being hit hardest right now. We might be the first ones, but it’s very important for other people to know they could be coming to you next.”The 2030 plan is an agenda put forth by the United Nations, supposedly to improve many aspects of global peace. One aspect of this agenda is to cut emissions by any means necessary which will cause backlash among those affected.“We already see now that in Italy farmers have gone out on the street as well,” she stated. “In Poland farmers are going out. So it’s spilling over which is a really good sign because like I said these restrictions are going to be very relevant for everyone because obviously it’s a global agenda.”As I drive through the Netherland countryside, I see massive hay stacks of loose hay piled up adjacent to highways. It must have been part of the plan, because with a quick tractor push and lighter, the highways are ablaze. Farmers are not going gently. pic.twitter.com/0LaiMoYNYQ— Keean Bexte 🇳🇱 (@TheRealKeean) July 7, 2022The agenda was recently implemented in Sri Lanka where the government banned chemical fertilizers which caused a food shortage and economic crisis to erupt across the country. This resulted in the ouster of the government. With so many other countries already experiencing similar restrictions some said it is only a matter of time before American farmers start becoming affected.If enacted in America, the restrictions would likely force mass culling of livestock, use of synthetic fertilizers and end with many farmers losing their business and land all together. There are no plans to go as far as The Netherlands in the US currently, but Democrats have recently passed an anti-energy spending spree which gives over $300 billion to so-called green energy technologies. They claim these technologies will reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030. This will line up with the UN’s agenda target date.","Protesting farmers block a drawbridge at locks in the Princess Margriet canal, preventing all ship traffic from passing in Gaarkeuken, northern Netherlands, Monday, July 4, 2022.

According to CBS News’ “battleground tracker,” the GOP would secure 230 seats in the House this November while Democrats would hold 205 seats. The poll found Republicans would get 12 seats more than the 218 required to control the lower chamber.Meanwhile, a rising number of voters are leaning Republican in upcoming midterms due to economic recession, runaway inflation and other Democrat policy failures. Republicans are expecting a much larger red wave that is predicted by this poll.“Well, they are afraid of us,” stated Kari Lake, (R) Arizona gubernatorial candidate. “They thought that when they stole that election in 2020 they made Donald Trump, the America First movement and all the patriots go away. That we would just crawl off and never return, but we’re emboldened. We’re not gonna back down and we’re gonna fight.” The CBS poll also found enthusiasm among Democrat voters is extremely low and they are less likely to show up to vote than Republicans.","A woman votes in the presidential primary election at the the Summit View Church of the Nazarene in Kansas City, Mo., on March 10, 2020.Charlie Riedel / AP file",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/200521-missouri-voting-al-1012-e1656715614110.jpg," One-On-One With Harley Lippman, CEO Of Genesis10TOPICS:America FirstDonald TrumpECONOMYelectionGOPHouse of Representativesinflationmidtermsnewsnews politicsOANOANNpoliticsRECESSIONREPUBLICANS SHARETWEETPINSHARE",https://www.oann.com/poll-gop-to-get-230-house-seats-in-nov-midterms/
