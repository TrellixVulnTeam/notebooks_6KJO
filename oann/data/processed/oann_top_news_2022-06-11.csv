9:08 AM PT",House GOP leaders slam Jan. 6 Committee ahead of televised public hearings,"House GOP leaders are condemning the Democrat-led January 6 Committee’s decision to hold televised hearings.During a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday, GOP House Conference Chair Elise Stefanik said Republicans will be setting the record straight while Democrats obsess over what she called an “illegitimate hearing.” Stefanik blasted the committee for hiring former ABC News President James Goldston to produce the primetime hearing and denounced the panel’s work as a politically-charged smear campaign.“This further solidifies what we know, what we have known from day one,” said Stefanik. “This committee is not about seeking the truth, it is a smear campaign against President Donald Trump, against Republican members of Congress and against Trump voters across this country. This committee is unconstitutional, it is illegitimate. It was not put together according to the rules of the House. It does not serve any true legislative or oversight purpose and it is not about finding out why Nancy Pelosi left the Capitol so ill prepared that day.”‘""While Democrats obsess over this illegitimate hearing, House Republicans will be setting the record straight and telling the truth about lame-duck Speaker Pelosi’s sham political witch-hunt."" – @RepStefanik pic.twitter.com/gOmP9fvOiE— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) June 8, 2022House Minority Whip Steve Scalise called out Pelosi for continuing to politicize January 6 while ignoring the several crisis Americans are facing, including high gas prices, high inflation and the southern border crisis.“Fentanyl…you wanna talk about deaths among young kids, thousands of young kids have died from fentanyl that’s come across our southern border last year alone,” said Scalise. “Over 100,000 American last year died from the opioids that are coming across our open southern border. We can do something about that today and unfortunately there’s no legislation that Speaker Pelsoi will bring to secure our southern border. There’s no primetime hearing to talk about what needs to be done to keep Americans safe.”WATCH @SteveScalise on Pelosi’s political witch-hunt:“The idea that Nancy Pelosi continues to politicize January 6th while ignoring things like high gas prices, inflation that’s out of control, a border crisis.” pic.twitter.com/6eEXyYXDaz— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) June 8, 2022Congressman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) asserted the January 6 panel is aiming to prevent former President Donald Trump from running for the White House.Additionally, Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) pointed out that he and Jordan were blocked from joining the committee by Pelosi.“Speaker Pelosi blocked us because she is afraid of what a real investigation would uncover,” Banks  asserted. “She doesn’t want Americans to find out what really happened on January 6 and leading up to it. And she doesn’t want anyone asking questions about her role in and her responsibilities in securing the United States Capitol.”This comes as members of the January 6 Committee claim they will be sharing new details about the events leading up to the capitol protests, including unseen videos. The panel’s first televised public hearing is set to begin Thursday.","Rep.

(Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:17 PM PT – Thursday, June 9, 2022The leader of the La Luz Del Mundo Church was sentenced to more than 16 years in prison for the sexual abuse of teens. Naasón Joaquín García was sentenced in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday, after he pleaded guilty to three felonies just days before his long-awaited trial.Garcia plead guilty to two counts of forcible oral copulation involving minors and one count of a lewd act on a 15-year-old child. He was scheduled to go on trial Monday. He faced 23 felony counts that included allegations of human trafficking to produce child pornography and rape, but he accepted a last minute plea deal from the California Attorney General’s office.When he took the plea deal, some of his victims who wanted to testify against him became enraged. They were promised that no plea deal would be offered. In return for the guilty plea, the DA dropped the most serious allegations of five victims from 2015 to 2018.“As for the Jane Doe, at this point I apologize,” said Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. “My hands are tied. Lawyers do what lawyers do.”La Luz Del Mundo is the largest evangelical church in Mexico and has branches in more than 50 countries. To his more than five million followers worldwide, Garcia had been considered an “apostle” of Jesus Christ. To his victims, he was Satan incarnated.“I never consented to having sex with you,” voiced victim, Jane Doe. “I would never have said yes to you.”Another leader in the church, Alondra Campo, was charged with recruiting teenage girls to dance for Garcia in provocative outfits. If the girls refused, Garcia reportedly told them they were going against God. He claimed an apostle of god like him would never be judged for his actions.“He said it was a blessing to be with him,” cried out Jane Doe. “As he raped me, he would command me to seal my lips to preserve the blessing he was granting me and I did.”Prosecutors said the victims were essentially brainwashed by Garcia and were made to feel ostracized by their church community if they didn’t submit to his desires.“As to those family member who abandoned the Jane Doe’s, shame, shame on you,” stated Coen.","Naasón Joaquín García, the former leader of the fundamentalist Guadalajara, Mexico-based church La Luz del Mundo, sits during his sentencing in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday, June 8, 2022.

According to authorities, 26-year-old Nicholas Roske was taken into custody early Wednesday morning while armed with a gun, knife, pepper spray and burglary tools.Roske told detectives he was upset about the leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade as well as the recent wave of violence across the country and was there to kill Kavanaugh. Back in his community of Simi Valley, California, the local police executed a search warrant on his home to find anything that could be linked to his arrest. Officers said they did not have any previous run-ins with Roske aside from a traffic stop.If convicted, Roske could face up to 20-years in a federal prison.Meanwhile, the House of Representatives is considering legislation to provide security to immediate family members of Supreme Court justices. The Senate passed the Supreme Court Police Parity Act back in early May amid threats against justices over the leaked draft opinion concerning Roe v. Wade.On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) took to the floor of the upper chamber to call for the House to take action after Roske was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home.“This is exactly, exactly the kind of event that many feared that the terrible breach of the court’s rules and norms could fuel,” stated the Kentucky Republican. “This is exactly the kind of event that many worried the unhinged, reckless, apocalyptic rhetoric from prominent figures toward the court going back many months, and especially in recent weeks, could make more likely.”House Democrats may reportedly add a provision to the bill to provide protection to clerks and other staff. Reports have suggested House lawmakers will move to pass the bill in the near future.","Erin Schaff/Pool via APMembers of the Supreme Court pose for a group photo at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., April 23, 2021.",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scotus-family-2021-ap-ps-210423_1619202370233_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg, Dozens Of Women File Tort Claims Against FBI Seeking MoreTOPICS:abortionBrett KavanaughCaliforniacourtcrimedemocratgun controlHouse DemocratsJustice Brett KavanaughlawMitch McConnellnewsNicholas RoskeOANOANNpoliticsRepublicanRoe v.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:32 AM PT – Thursday, June 9, 2022House Republicans responded to new gun control laws proposed by Democrats. GOP representatives hosted a press conference regarding legislation being proposed in Congress.On Wednesday, congresswoman Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said proposed new bills would not end mass shootings. She pointed to places like New York and Chicago that have rampant gun violence despite implementing strict gun control measures.One proposal seeks to adopt red flag laws on the federal level, while an omnibus package contains measures such as codifying a ban on bump stocks and banning high capacity magazines.“What we shouldn’t do is accept the Democrats jamming radical left wing legislation through Congress at the expense of the American people’s liberty and freedom,” Boebert staed. “It would not end school shootings, but it certainly would disarm law abiding citizens. And if the leftist policies and these gun grabbing bills worked then New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, these cities would be safer than Mayberry, but they’re not.”Additionally, Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) accused Democrats of not wanting to address mental health issues that could reduce gun violence.“They’re doing it because they don’t want to focus on the root of the problem,” asserted the Louisiana lawmaker. “We’ve offered time and time again legislation to get to the root of the problem. Why are young kids committing more violent acts? Why shouldn’t we be asking that question? Why shouldn’t we be working on solving that problem as opposed to the Democrats approach of just taking away more guns?”Boebert ended the press conference by reminding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) about her husband who was recently arrested for driving under the influence.“Maybe you all should do your job and remind Speaker Pelosi how dangerous DUIs are and how many lives are lost at the hands of drunk drivers, rather than pushing forward eight unconstitutional gun legislation this week in Congress,” said the Colorado congresswoman.Paul Pelosi's DUI charges have been dropped.Is anyone really surprised?— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) June 8, 2022Later on Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted 228-to-199 in favor of the Protect Our Kids bill that would raise minimum age to purchase certain weapons from 18 to 21.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:39 AM PT – Thursday, June 9, 2022The Biden administration has attempted to solve economic and migration woes with the country’s neighbors. President Joe Biden promoted his economic policies to the Western Hemisphere as inflation has continued to cripple America’s middle class. While speaking at the Summit of the America’s in Los Angeles Wednesday, he took a swipe at the tax cuts of the Trump administration.“What’s true in the United States is true in every country,” Biden said. “Trickle-down economics does not work. When we invest in strengthening workers and the middle class, the poor have a ladder up and those at the top do just fine. That’s how we can increase opportunity and decrease the persistent inequity.”I’m on my way to Los Angeles to host the Ninth Summit of the Americas. I look forward to working with leaders from across the Western Hemisphere to strengthen our bonds and to address our core challenges — from economic prosperity and climate change to migration and COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/bDndE5gwDo— President Biden (@POTUS) June 8, 2022Since the beginning of the year, the Biden economy has not seen year-on-year inflation rates dip below 7 percent. Despite his calls to address inequity, a recent report from Bank of America found such inflation disproportionately affected people of color and rural communities.In the face of such numbers, the President vowed to increase supply chains and trade throughout the America’s. He also addressed the northward migration taking place in the hemisphere. The Democrat teased a cooperative migration plan with the summit’s participants as his administration tries to scrap the Trump-era ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy and Title 42.“We’ll also come together to launch the Los Angeles declaration,” he declared. “A ground breaking integrated new approach to managing migration and sharing responsibility across the hemisphere. The declaration represents a mutual commitment to invest in regional solutions that enhance stability, increase opportunities for safe and orderly migration through the region.”Biden’s remarks on immigration arose from a caravan of up to 15,000 people who are currently sneaking their way through Mexico towards the southern border. Leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras were not present despite being the source of 90 percent of America’s migration flow.Brazil and Argentina’s heads of state threatened to skip the conference until they were granted bilateral meetings with US officials. While trying to put on a brave face to America’s neighbors, Biden lamented to reporters about his negative press coverage regarding the economy and foreign policy aboard Air Force One.","President Joe Biden speaks during the opening ceremony at the Summit of the Americas Wednesday, June 8, 2022, in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 9:45 AM PT – Wednesday, June 8, 2022Vice President Kamala Harris announced funds to address what the Biden administration considers to be key causes of migration. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden’s border czar declared the inception of the Central American Service Corps, which is intended to target supposedly root causes of migration such as poverty, violence and climate change. The Vice President claimed the package will give individuals incentives to remain in their countries of origin.“This investment is on track to generate, as a result of what we have done so far,” said Harris. “Tens of thousands of jobs, as well as investments in sectors such as agriculture and textiles. This investment also means that more than 10 million people will have access to banking systems and credit.”The spending plan funds multiple private industries to expand operations in Central America, including $250 million for Visa to increase digital payment systems, $100 million for auto-part supplier Yazaki to hire more employees and a $700 million expansion of mobile networks in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The measure is also intended to promote youth programs, civil engagement activities and so-called green jobs.According to Harris, the funds will be an investment in making many Central American countries more attractive to reside in.“Consider that El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have a total population size of about 30 million people,” the vice president voiced. “A $3.2 billion investment will then have a direct impact on the quality of life for people throughout that region.”I'm proud of the work we're doing to address the root causes of migration from Central America. To date, we’ve secured more than $3.2 billion in investments from the private sector to create jobs and economic opportunity for those in the region.https://t.co/fG2fn0r5lP— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) June 7, 2022Although the funds are heading to Central America, they will not reach the migrant caravan currently making its way through Mexico. The caravan of up to 15,000 people is more than three-miles long and is marching towards the US border in anticipation of Title 42’s expiration.Since taking the role as border czar in March of last year, Harris has only visited the region twice.","Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a roundtable discussion with business executives during the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, Tuesday, June 7, 2022.

In a statement Thursday, he said the Democrat-controlled panel is a “unselect committee of political thugs.” Trump stressed, the committee includes the same group of people who were pushing the false Russia collusion hoax and then denied the obvious evidence of fraud in the 2020 elections.The 45th President made his comments just ahead of the January 6 show trial. Trump also said the Democrat committee knows he was asking for 20,000 National Guard or troops to be deployed at the US Capitol ahead of the protest, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down the offer.Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) echoed the sentiments while suggesting Democrats are playing politics. During a press conference Thursday, the California lawmaker affirmed Republicans have repeatedly denounced the violence at the US Capitol and Democrats are ignoring the crises that are effecting the American people.The House minority leader was also joined by Congress members Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) who argue the panel is an attack on the GOP and President Trump.

He stated that president Biden’s coronavirus relief bill put America over the top.

Meanwhile, the inflation rate has continued to hit its 40-year highs, landing at 8.3 percent in April. This comes shortly after Biden’s Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, landed in hot water for admitting she was wrong about her past assessments of the inflation crisis.Sen. Kennedy reiterates, it seems like Biden has given up. He questioned when the administration will start firing people for their mistakes.","Sen.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:58 AM PT – Friday, June 10, 2022Globalist billionaire George Soros unveiled a new program to prevent Latinos from voting Republican. A group of investors, led by a Soros-linked company, reportedly spent $80 million to establish a new media operation. It’s uniquely named Latino Media Network.The new network purchased 18 Spanish-language radio stations in 10 key markets across the US. These include Miami, Houston and Las Vegas where a significant number of Latino residents shifted to the Republican Party in recent years.Many Cuban Americans expressed outrage of the network’s possible acquisition of Miami radio mainstays WQBA and Radio Mambi. Attendees of a Bay of Pigs Museum news conference voiced concerns that Latino Media Group would attempt the stamp out the legacy socialism has left on Latin America.“We are very much afraid that it is a tremendous effort to silence the voices of our exile community, to silence the voices of the victims of communist tyranny in Cuba and elsewhere in our hemisphere,” expressed Sylvia Iriondo of the group Mothers and Women Against Repression in Cuba.Other speakers warned this is not only an attempt to erase the past, but to ignore current human rights injustices.“We’re unified in our condemnation of human rights abuses in Cuba and these two stations are iconic,” said Orlando Gutiérrez-Boronat from the group Assembly of the Cuban Resistance. “They’re a central hub of information from Cuba and about Cuba. And we’re concerned because there’s a political and ideological background here, baggage.”Sylvia Iriondo, left rear, president of Mothers and Women Against Repression, speaks at a news conference along with other Cuban exiles, of their concern of the sale of two local Spanish language radio stations, Wednesday, June 8, 2022, at the Bay of Pigs Museum and Brigade 2506 headquarters in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)While at the event, Florida Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez expressed her concern that the acquisition is a naked attempt to steer the country in a far-left direction in November.“And what we will not stand for is an attempt to control the narrative, to silence conservative viewpoints because it doesn’t fit with an overall agenda that is, in my opinion, very damaging to this country led by George Soros,” Nuñez stated.Prominent Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis and Sunshine State GOP Sen. Marco Rubio have also criticized the pending deal.

John Moolenaar (R-Mich.). “Is also in the position of sort of evaluating or giving opinions on drugs that work or don’t work.
