(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Thursday, May 19, 2022Jean Baretto continues to fight for his life after sheriff’s tasered him at a gas pump nearly three months ago. On Wednesday, it was revealed that Baretto’s legal team has allegedly obtained surveillance footage from a WaWa gas station in Central Florida where the incident took place. The incident shows their client being tackled from behind by one deputy while another hits him with a taser.That taser shot ignited the fire ball that engulfed Barreto and two nearby deputy’s according to the State Fire Marshall. The family and attorney’s of the man say he never committed a crime.At the time of the incident Osceola Sheriff’s Department alleged that Barretto was part of motorcyclists that were harassing and pointing guns at other drivers. His lawyers claim the video shows the 26-year old was not trying to flee and question why an electrical charge would be deployed at someone dealing with a highly flammable liquid.“In Osceola County we have no tolerance for this type of behavior,” said Osceola Sheriff Marcos Lopez. “We will identify you and catch you, even if you flee into another county.”The Attorney’s have asked for a renewed investigation as the sheriff’s office has not released any additional information including body camera video. On Tuesday, he underwent his sixth surgery since the fire. Doctors say he still has a long road to recovery. His lawyers state that he has been fighting for his life for the past 80 days with third-degree burns over 75-percent of his body.“We’re calling today for FDLE to take this case over or to have the U.S. Justice Department take this case over,” declared the NeJame Law Group. “There’s too much going on, too many questions that need to be asked.”Jean Baretto still has not been arrested or charged with any crime.","Motorcycle enthusiasts attend the 81st annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally on August 8, 2021 in Sturgis, South Dakota.

(Joel Martinez/The Monitor via AP, Pool)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:50 AM PT – Thursday, May 19, 2022Border Patrol agents in Arizona are preparing for the expiration of Title 42. Agents say they are experiencing a surge in migrant encounters near their checkpoint in Tucson. On Wednesday, they voiced that their encounters are vastly different from those reported in other border states such as Texas and California.Additionally, they’ve seen a 25-percent increase in 911 calls about illegal border crossings with authorities receiving up to 16 calls per day. Title 42 was put in place during the Trump administration and allowed border agents to turn away migrants attempting to cross into the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“Our numbers of apprehensions or encounters is more than 130,000 fiscal year to date,” said Border Agent Jesus Vasabilaso. “So our fiscal year started in October and then all the way to today. That’s up more than 50-percent compared to last year.”To combat this surge officials set up a working partnership with the Mexican National Guard to apprehend illegal migrants attempting to cross from both sides of the border.“We do what we call mirror patrol,” stated  Vasabilaso. We’ll patrol on our side, they’ll patrol on their side, so we’re both looking for any bad actors around the border. They’re looking for any ladders that smugglers will utilize to get people up and over the fence, they’re looking for people that are up to no good trying to assault migrants. If Title-42 goes away the border is not going to be open.”Title 42 is set to expire on May 23, but a federal judge in Louisiana is expected to hand down a ruling which could keep Title 42 in place.","Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas listens to Raul Ortiz, Chief, U.S. Border Patrol, as he tours the section of the border wall with Mexico, Tuesday, May 17, 2022, in La Joya, Texas.

(CDC via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:50 PM PT – Monday, May 23, 2022New York City confirmed it’s first case of Monkeypox on Friday. Officials say the patient is being quarantined as their investigation continues. This marks the second confirmed case in the U.S. after another man was found in Boston earlier in the week.Monkeypox causes flu-like symptoms before the characteristic rash develops. The virus is spread through close contact with people, animals or material infected with the virus. It enters the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract, the eyes, nose and mouth“We’ve seen a few cases in Europe over the last five years, just in travelers,” said Dr. Rosamund Lewis, who runs the WHO’s smallpox research. “This is the first time we’re seeing cases across many countries at the same time in people who have not traveled to the endemic regions in Africa.” #Monkeypox has so far been reported from 11 countries that normally don't have the disease. WHO is working with these countries & others to expand surveillance, and provide guidance.There are about 80 confirmed cases, and 50 pending investigations. More likely to be reported. pic.twitter.com/YQ3pVJVNVQ— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) May 20, 2022The outbreak has quickly advanced across Europe and North America over the last week and is expected to be far more widespread as more doctors look for the signs and symptoms. The CDC has put medical professionals on alert and is warning those with higher risk factors, particularly men who have sex with other men, to be vigilant.“Many diseases can be spread through sexual contact. You could get a cough or a cold through sexual contact,” said WHO advisor Andy Seale. “It doesn’t mean that it’s a sexually transmitted disease.” Seale’s agreed many of the people infected in the current outbreak identify as gay or bisexual, but “this is a virus that could affect anyone.” Monkeypox is taking over the global conversation and has left many questioning the validity of the virus’s actual threat.PCR tests are used to identify the infection.TOPICS:AfricadiseaseEuropeINVESTIGATIONmonkeypoxNew York CitynewsOANOANNPCRrosamund lewissicknesssmallpoxWHO TWEETPIN","This 1997 image provided by the CDC during an investigation into an outbreak of monkeypox, which took place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formerly Zaire, and depicts the dorsal surfaces of the hands of a monkeypox case patient, who was displaying the appearance of the characteristic rash during its recuperative stage.
