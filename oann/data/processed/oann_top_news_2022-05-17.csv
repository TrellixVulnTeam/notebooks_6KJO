8:30 AM PT",Speaker Pelosi claims GOP is using ‘black mail’ to demand Title 42 vote,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested that Republicans are using black mail  to demand a vote from Democrats on Title 42.  Pelosi made those comments during an interview Sunday and questioned why the measure was in the COVID relief bill.“There’s no use holding it up to blackmail, as the Republicans are trying to do,” said Pelosi. “We are working on it. We will find a way. It has to be done.”Senate Republicans blocked the upper chamber from advancing Democrats $10 billion COVID bill after the Biden administration refused to vote on reversing Title 42.Tons of reminders, all day everyday, why the Biden Admin absolutely must not end Title 42 in a week, which would certainly open the floodgates to even more illegal immigration. https://t.co/vD5JJUf2DC— Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) May 16, 2022However, an increasing number of Senate Democrats are reportedly becoming more open to holding a vote on the policy.

The Strohman family lost several valuable belongings after the Coastal Fire destroyed at least 20 homes in the Laguna Hills area last week.The Stroham’s were aware of the fires when neighbors provided them with clips of the home in flames. The families American flag was untouched and still flying despite everything. Once evacuation orders were lifted they were able to find a US flag and a 9/11 mug that firefighters managed to save.“I thinks its a sign, we’ll get through it, we’ll preserve,” said Max Strohman. “I’m pretty much out of words. It’s a lot to take in, it really hits seeing it in person.”Earlier in the week, about 900 homes were within the mandatory evacuation zone due to the Coastal Fire. Those numbers have shrunken since.Favorable weather conditions and outstanding work by our firefighters at the #CoastalFire has helped us reach 80% containment today.  The fire remains at 200 acres burned. @OCSDLagunaNigue @LagunaNiguelCty pic.twitter.com/81hotqSRgH— OCFA PIO (@OCFireAuthority) May 16, 2022The family took a look at their home in disbelief.

They are truly the best among us.”As a way to honor fallen officers, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington D.C. has continued to engrave fallen heroes names on its memorial wall. McCarthy added, standing with law enforcement shouldn’t be something we do just for one week.“Police week means so much to all of us and to some of us means mourning, mourning the 619 names we just engraved on the wall,” he uttered. While National Police Week begins on May 15, McCarthy voiced, “America must back the blue all year round.”The sacrifices of our law enforcement officers are a clear reminder that standing with law enforcement isn’t something we can do only during #NationalPoliceWeek.

(Al Drago/Pool Photo via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:27 PM PT – Friday, May 13, 2022Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has pumped the breaks on congressional leaders $40 billion rush to Ukraine. The Republican single-handedly blocked the quick passage of President Joe Biden’s Ukraine aid package.While speaking the Senate floor Thursday, the Kentuckian explained that the financial gifts to Ukraine are causing inflation and increasing national debt. He warned, they cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy.“My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation and no matter how sympathetic the cause,” said Paul. “My oath of office is to to the national security of the United States of America. “The House passed the $40 billion bill just hours after its official text was released. Paul noted, this is the second spending bill for Ukraine in two months, however, this version is much larger than the first. If this bill is passed, a US-Ukraine aid would reach $60 billion borrowed money.“America can’t afford to be the worlds policeman,” said Paul. “The US is trying to recover from $1.6 trillion we spent on wars in the Middle East. Not to mention the $5 trillion borrowed from COVID. We should not forget the Soviet Union collapsed in large part…because it ran out of money.”My oath of office is to the U.S. Constitution, not to any foreign nation. Congress is trying yet again to ram through a spending bill – one that I doubt anyone has actually read – and there’s no oversight included into how the money is being spent.— Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 13, 2022He then suggested lawmakers install a special inspector general to oversee how the Ukraine military aid is spent.“Congress should evaluate the cost of continuing down this path,” Paul concluded. “The biggest threat to the United States is debt and inflation.”Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will now take procedural steps in an attempt to overcome Paul’s objection, which could take several days.","Sen.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:08 PM PT – Monday, May 16, 2022Republican governors across the country are increasingly expressing excitement at the likely prospect the Supreme Court will overturn the landmark case Roe v. Wade.On Sunday, Oklahoma’s Republican Governor Kevin Stitt said that he was excited for the state to enforce its fetal heartbeat law, which bans all abortions after a heartbeat can be detected. This usually occurs around six weeks into pregnancy.“I represent 4 million Oklahomans,” said Stitt. “We believe life begins at conception and we’re going to protect life in Oklahoma. There were 5,000  just in Oklahoma alone. Five-thousand unborn children that were killed last year and we don’t believe in that in Oklahoma. Other states can do things differently.”Oklahoma abortion law wont be able to be enforced everywhere in the state. Much of the state is controlled by sovereign Native American tribes who can set their own rules for their territory.“The tribes in Oklahoma are super liberal,” Stitt expressed. “We think that there’s the possibility that some tribes may try to set up abortion on demand.”He was sparse on the details of what he wants to do, but he did say he wants protection for “pre-born babies” to be strengthened as much as possible. There is no exception for rape or incest in the law.I am proud to sign SB 1503, the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act into law.I want Oklahoma to be the most pro-life state in the country because I represent all four million Oklahomans who overwhelmingly want to protect the unborn. pic.twitter.com/XQr7khRLRa— Governor Kevin Stitt (@GovStitt) May 3, 2022The court is expected to release its official opinion before the end of June.","Oklahoma Gov.

The White House released a statement over the weekend, which announced Biden and the First Lady will visit the city on Tuesday to grieve with the mourning community.Jill and I pray for the victims, their families and devastated community from yesterday’s mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. Our hearts are heavy once again but our resolve must not waver; we must work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of this nation.— President Biden (@POTUS) May 15, 2022Biden addressed the shooting on Sunday and assured the Justice Department is investigating the incident as a hate crime. He also praised the actions of law enforcement and offered condolences to the victims as well as their families. Ten people lost their lives during the attack.  He also called on Americans to do everything in their power to end “hate-fueled domestic terrorism.”Meanwhile, New York Governor Kathy Hochul (D) said CEOs of social media companies should be held accountable for certain crimes. During an interview Sunday, the Democrat said these chief executives need to assure the public that they are taking every step possible to monitor risky information.Her remarks came after the suspected shooter reportedly posted a 180 page manifesto online, just one day before opening fire at the Buffalo supermarket. The act of violence left 10 people dead while the attack was live streamed for an online audience to witness.“Well this manifesto tells everything to us and that is what is so bone-chiling about it,” stated the governor. “There is the ability for people to write and subscribe to such philosophies filled with hate and white supremacist acts of terrorism that are being fermented on social media, and to know that what this one individual did has been shared with the rest of the world.”Hochul said violent hate messages need to be monitored and shut down the moment they are exposed. Meanwhile, the suspected gunman from the Buffalo shooting has been charged.

Sen. Scott consequently added, the organization must not have control over the health and lives of Americans.“The Biden administration wants to control through fear and mandate, so the government is touching every part of your life,” said Scott. “I wont stand for it, Americans wont stand for it. They know that the order is an over reach of power. The nation should be free to make choices that they feel are in their best interests for their own health and of loved ones.”Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) echoed his colleagues remarks while also taking to Twitter recently. The Arkansas Republican called the health agency “corrupt,” while asserting it’s controlled by Chinese Communist Party.The World Health Organization is corrupt and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. The last thing the Biden Administration should do is give the @WHO authority over Americans.— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) May 16, 2022The concern from GOP lawmakers comes as the World Health Assembly moves to create a global accord on pandemic response, which includes both prevention measures and preparedness actions. This would establish an intergovernmental negotiating body that would ultimately decide what measures are “deemed appropriate.”Both Republican lawmakers urged against the Biden administration allowing WHO to have authority over Americans, especially with such a strong Chinese influence. This comes as the world’s second largest economy has continued to falter due to an ongoing zero-COVID lockdown strategy.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:45 PM PT – Monday, May 16, 2022The Golden State is moving forward with a bill that undermines families medical decisions. The California bill allows children from ages 12 to 17 to receive different forms of healthcare without parental consent.The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee at the beginning of May and recently passed the Senate Health Committee. The vote was 21-7 with Sen. Ben Hueso (D-Calif.) and Melissa Hurtado (D-Calif.) voting ‘no.’The authors of SB-871 and SB-866, Scott Weiner (D-Calif.) and Dr. Richard Pan, are known for authoring radical vaccine bills.Mother and founder of the San Diego-based grassroots coalition Let them Breathe, Sharon Mckeeman noted the possibility of the bill being passed.“If this were to pass, there is going to be a mass exit from the public school system,” said McKeeman. “We are seeing that families are outraged and concerned that this responsibility is being put on their children’s shoulders. All this decision making, instead of staying in the family unit…especially during a time of uncertainty.” Golden State parent advocates have been fighting against these mandates in public schools and are concerned about the California Legislature undermining the family unit.Given that Democrats hold a veto-proof majority in both chambers and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) doesn’t have any issues proposing vaccine mandates, it’s a possibility the Golden State could see this bill come to fruition.Despite this, San Diego-based attorney and father, Scott Davison believes there is a path moving forward and “still hope for California.” “We really need these parents to speak out and get more involved with their school system, so that this doesn’t become a reality that we just push off into the future,” concluded Davison. The next step is for the California State Assembly to vote on the bill and for Gov. Newsom (D-Calif.) to veto the bill or sign it into law.","State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, addresses the state Senate at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif., Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022.

The Goldman Sachs executive added, elevated inflation may persist for a long time, which may worsen quality of life for millions of Americans.“Some of the supply chain shocks will go away, but some of it will be a little bit stickier and will be with us for a while,” he explained. “And while we’re talking about this in the macro sense, overall for individuals and certainly the individuals at the bottom quartile of the pie sharing, it’s going to be quite difficult and oppressive.”Blankfein went on to say he believes the US financial system will get through this crisis and risks will reduce after the Ukraine crisis is over. Meanwhile, economist Robin Woods, a former Chief FX Strategist at Goldman Sachs, echoed  Blankfein’s warning while suggesting a global recession is coming.Global recession is coming.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:48 AM PT – Monday, May 16, 2022Former First Lady Melania Trump said it’s “sad to see” what’s going on in America on President Joe Biden’s watch. In an interview Sunday, the former First Lady pointed out that a lot of people are struggling and suffering from problems both in the US as well as abroad.“It’s heartbreaking to see that they (Americans) are struggling and the food is not available for children in (the) 21st Century in the United States of America,” she noted. “What’s going on, it’s unthinkable. A lot of people are dying from drugs and it’s very sad to see.”Her remarks came after recent economic data put Americans on edge after the inflation report for April showed it increased 8.3 percent from a year ago. Last week, Biden spoke about the state of the economy while blaming everyone and everything but his own administration. Prior to the briefing, the President appeared to tout his economic plan while claiming it would lower the deficit and ensure wealthy Americans pay their fair share.Joe Biden is vacationing in Delaware while the crisis at the southern border gets worse, inflation is out of control, and Americans can’t afford to fill their gas tanks.— GOP (@GOP) May 15, 2022Last month, Biden appeared to continuously blame inflation on Russia and its invasion of Ukraine, although prices had been soaring for several months before the crisis. Most notably, gas prices soared significantly at the beginning of 2022. Despite his claims surrounding the state of the economy, Melania pointed out the Trump administration achieved a lot during its four-year term. She also did not rule out returning to the White House at some point. When asked about the possibility, she commented “never say never.”“I enjoyed taking care of the White House, it was my home for a while,” Melania stated. “I understood it is (the) people’s house and it was a privilege to live there.” The former First Lady also criticized mainstream media over what she asserted is partisan bias and dishonest reporting. Melania said the American people can see through the media lies.","FILE – In this March 10, 2020, file photo first lady Melania Trump speaks at the at the National PTA Legislative Conference in Alexandria, Va.

According to a poll by Swedish broadcaster SVT, 43 percent of Swedish men between the ages 18 and 29 are opposed to their country abandoning neutral status and joining NATO.Meanwhile, another 43 percent said they were in favor of joining NATO. The poll found people of older generations and women support joining NATO the most, while young Swedish men are the least supportive of the proposal.“I think that it put our security in jeopardy and then we’re also allying ourselves with less nice and trustworthy countries,” said Olof Bjork, a court employee in Stockholm. “We could increase other cooperation, military cooperation, and increase our own ability to defend ourselves, invest in a national conscription defense.”This comes as the Swedish ruling party abandoned its 73-year long opposition to NATO and voted to join the alliance in recent days. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson recently announced that her government has decided to formally apply.Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, via translator, explains decision to apply for NATO membership:“Despite the fact that non-alignment has served us well in over 200 years … it won’t serve us as well in the future … Sweden is best defended within NATO.” pic.twitter.com/awYLYARpgk— The Recount (@therecount) May 16, 2022Swedish politicians are citing the Ukraine crisis as the reason to join NATO, while Russia is saying such a move would make Sweden potential target for its military.","Sweden’s Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, right, and the Moderate Party’s leader Ulf Kristersson give a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden, Monday, May 16, 2022.
