12:00 PM PT",Pelosi: House to vote on sweeping abortion law,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) revisited an abortion law in the wake of the overturning of Roe. On Thursday, the top Democrat doubled down on her commitment to federalizing abortion policy throughout all 50 states.“A woman’s right to choose is a kitchen table issue,” Pelosi voiced. “Contraception, birth control — they are kitchen table issues.”House Democrats planned on sending a bill to codify Roe to the Senate whether it is likely to succeed or not. Pelosi proclaimed both congressional Democrats and Joe Biden support enshrining the procedure into national law and that the act is intrinsically American.“This is something that is core to who we are,” she said. “It’s about freedom. It’s about health care. It’s about respect for women and that is something that the president is wedded to.”“Catholic” Nancy Pelosi Nationwide abortion-on-demand is “core to who we are” and about ""freedom"". pic.twitter.com/lZ4GsIQzuv— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) July 15, 2022Pelosi promised to bring a revamped version of the Women’s Health Protection Act to the House floor, once again. This will codify several aspects of Roe into law. The bill would make abortion access a right, while removing waiting periods and bans which would provide admitting privileges to hospitals to perform the procedure.Critics of the bill have claimed it violates states’ rights as state-level restrictions would be superseded by the new law. The House originally passed the bill, only for the legislation to be shot down in the Senate in a 49 to 51 vote.  However, Pelosi has refused to compromise on the bill’s proposals to vault the 60 vote filibuster threshold.Pelosi has not given up on making Roe the law of the land, even if the bill is stifled in the Senate. The California Democrat pivoted to making an abortion based campaign pitch that encouraged Americans to vote for Democrat candidates nationwide this November.“In fewer than 100 days people will be voting,” she stated. “We have to elect a couple more Democratic senators so that we can get around the filibuster. We have great candidates. Our country is at risk. Our democracy is at risk.”House Democratic women led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emerge on the steps donning green as the chamber prepares to pass (yet again) a bill that would legalize abortion nationwide and ensure women access to travel across state lines to get care pic.twitter.com/hU80KXcToA— Farnoush Amiri (@FarnoushAmiri) July 15, 2022Pelosi has vowed to bring the bill to a vote on the House floor as soon as Friday.","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks at her weekly press conference, Thursday, July 14, 2022, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Suffolk County Police said the fifth shark attack in under two weeks occurred Wednesday evening when a 49-year-old Arizona man was bitten on the left wrist and buttocks while standing waist-deep at Seaview Beach.Beachgoers captured cell phone video of a shark near the shore at field 5 of Robert Moses State Park beach on Sunday5 people on Long Island were bitten by a shark in the last 2 weeks2 alone yesterdayAt least 3 sightings today, including at this same beach @ABC7NY pic.twitter.com/SNEeFPsdqK— Chantee Lans (@ChanteeLans) July 14, 2022He was able to walk out of the water and was taken by helicopter to a local hospital for treatment in stable condition. This just 12 hours after 41-year-old attorney Shawn Donnelly was bitten in the calf by a sand tiger shark while surfing at Smith Point Beach.“It was definitely scary, not going to pretend like it wasn’t,” Donnelly said. “It hit me and knocked me off my board. I saw the fin and I saw the shark.”Shawn Donnelly has been surfing the waters off Long Island for decades. Never even SEEN a shark! Till now. 😬 He will be A-ok! But still…he was bitten yesterday, only 10 yards off shore at Smith Point in Suffolk County.

He was treading water around 200 yards from shore when a small shark approached and nipped his ankle. Mullins was able to make it to shore with only minor injuries.Notice for Smith Point Beach: Swimming has been suspended at this time due to dangerous marine life activity on Wednesday July 13, 2022.— Suffolk County Parks (@SuffolkParks) July 13, 2022Less than a week before another lifeguard was bitten in the chest and hand at the same beach, but escaped after thrashing with the creature near to shore. He returned to work Thursday and said that he’s lucky his injuries weren’t any worse.“I’m just grateful my injuries were minor in comparison to other instances,” voiced lifeguard Zach Gallo. “I think I can pass on some knowledge to fellow lifeguards and younger guards coming up.”The first recent shark encounter occurred three days before this when a 37-year-old swimmer was bitten on his right foot near Jones Beach. Shark deterring efforts, including the deployment of spotter drones and lifeguards on wave runners have been initiated. Authorities have warned beachgoers to only go to protected beaches with lifeguards and avoid going into the water without a partner.",SHARE,https://hnwebcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/oann/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/parler_white.png, Pelosi: House To Vote On Sweeping Abortion LawTOPICS:beachesbeachgoersincidentslifeguardLong IslandnewsOANOANNoceansharkswimmerwater SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/5-shark-attacks-in-2-weeks-prompt-long-island-beach-closures/

According to a preliminary report issued Thursday, DNA testing found the child’s father was driving the vehicle. Nine people were killed in the head-on collision in March after their pickup truck crashed into a van carrying men’s and women’s golf team members from the University of the Southwest.“A Dodge 2500 pickup was traveling southbound on FM 1788,” the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement. “A Ford Transit passenger van registered to the University of the Southwest in Hobbs, NM was traveling northbound on FM 1788.”One victim was Laci Stone, a freshman member of the women’s golf team who was majoring in global business management, according to a family member. The school identified the other students who died as 19-year-old Mauricio Sanchez, 19-year-old Travis Garcia, 22-year-old Jackson Zinn, 21-year-old Karisa Raines and 18-year-old Tiago Sousa. USW President Quint Thurman also confirmed the death of coach Tyler James.“Last night Laci’s golf team was involved in a crash leaving a golf tournament,” Laci’s mother Chelsi Stone posted on Facebook. “Our sweet Laci didn’t make it. Our Laci is gone! She has been an absolute ray of sunshine during this short time on earth.”The driver and passenger in the pickup truck also died. Investigators were able to identify the remains of the driver by his size. National Transportation Safety Board investigators said they found the presence of methamphetamine in the father’s blood.NEW reversal from NTSB: DNA shows a 13-year-old boy was NOT the driver but *actually a passenger* in the pickup that hit a University of the Southwest golf team van.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:47 PM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022Recently retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is returning to Harvard University to teach. Harvard announced the 83-year-old is re-joining its law school faculty in a statement on Friday, revealing his appointment as Byrne Professor of Administrative Law and Process.The college said Breyer will be teaching seminars and reading groups among other activities. Breyer is a Harvard Law School graduate who first joined the faculty back in 1967 and taught until President Clinton nominated him to the supreme court in 1994.“Justice Breyer is a historic jurist and a world-class legal scholar who also has a distinguished history as a member of this faculty,” Dean John F. Manning said in a statement. “His brilliance, experience, collegiality, openness and intellectual inquisitiveness will deeply enrich our community and advance our mission of teaching, scholarship, and service.”When I took administrative law from Breyer, he was a sweet man who also taught antitrust but was not Areeda. Now, of course, he is a giant — and still a sweet man.  Great news for @Harvard_Law & its students, but also for the American legal system. Hope he will help @FTC, too. https://t.co/WWr3U5ZcRU— Stephen Calkins (@scalkins2) July 15, 2022Breyer announced his retirement last January, clearing the way for President Joe Biden to nominate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to take his seat. Breyer’s retirement from the high court became effective on June 30 after the court released its last opinion in one of the most significant terms in decades. Jackson was sworn in the same day.In his last term, the 83-year-old justice found himself in dissent in cases concerning abortion, gun rights, the environment and religious liberty, as the 6 to 3 conservative leaning court jolted to the right with the addition of three of former President Donald Trump’s nominees. Jackson who was a former clerk to Breyer will not shift the ideological make up of the court, but at 51 years old she is likely to serve for decades.The retired justice said he is very pleased to return to the university.","FILE – Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, appointed by President Bill Clinton, sits with fellow Supreme Court justices for a group portrait at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, Nov. 30, 2018.

While speaking out on the efforts by Biden officials to improve the economy, she pointed out that inflation is unacceptably highDuring a news conference Thursday, Yellen asserted the Biden administration’s top economic priority is to bring inflation down. She claimed the labor market is currently very strong and in good shape, despite inflation hitting a 40-year record high this week.The Treasury secretary also said she would continue to push hard for a cap on the price of Russian oil to avoid future surges in oil prices. The official also said the administration is very supportive of the Federal Reserves efforts to lower inflation amid a number of recent interest rate hikes by the Central Bank.“Also the work that we’re doing to institute the price cap on Russian oil to avoid potential future spikes in oil prices,” Yellen noted. “We’re very supportive of deficit reduction and very much hope that Congress will pass the reconciliation bill that would help lower some of the important costs faced by consumers.Her remarks came after GOP senators expressed alarm about inflation during a press briefing on Capitol Hill Wednesday. Republicans said the Biden administration needs to stop the reckless spending and increase production of supplies including oil in the US.Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) contends Democrat policies and laws that have drastically increased daily living expenses for Americans are to blame for the current economic crisis.

Kathy Hochul speaks to reporters in the Red Room at the state Capitol, July 1, 2022, about legislation passed during a special legislative session, in Albany, N.Y. (AP Photo/Hans Pennink, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:59 AM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced new funding aimed at preventing gun crime. During a Thursday press conference, the Democrat announced her state is investing $220 million into preventing what she claims to be an influx of firearms entering in from other states. This includes $20 million for law enforcement despite her interest in removing the NYPD’s qualified immunity, which would force officers to pay for their own legal fees should they be accused of misconduct.” I said, you know what? Let’s triple that amount of money,” stated the governor. “Okay, let’s triple that. So that’s exactly the $20 million that we’re investing in snug type programs as well as money for law enforcement, for retraining and to help them have strategies to reduce crime because we are better off when we are partnering together to reduce crime overall, are we not?”Furthermore, Hochul said funds would be spent on establishing nonprofits and hospitals in areas where they have seen an uptick in gun related crimes. An additional $2 million will be used to to respond to the trauma experienced by gun crime victims.I’m in Brooklyn announcing funding to fight gun violence, support victims and survivors, and bolster our state’s response to this public health crisis.

She then went to double down on her efforts to circumvent the Supreme Court’s ruling, which struck down New York’s good cause provision for their concealed carry law.“So I will close by saying we’re going to continue changing our laws,” stated the governor. “We allowed more extreme risk order protections. You’ve heard about them. You know, they are when you know someone shows signs of doing danger, something harmful themselves and others. We actually are not powerless any longer that people can see. I see that. We’re going to have training across the state for teachers and businesses and law enforcement and organizations like yours.”In the meantime, New York has begun implementing new policies to make getting a concealed carry license difficult by having individuals turn over items and information such as their social media history.","FILE – New York Gov.

The Thursday hearing witnesses list included notable pro-life activists, academics and legal experts.The vastly different priorities of the two parties were evident as Democrats and the pundits they host present the repeal of federal abortion as a slippery slope towards absolute tyranny.“We are in the midst of an extreme right wing assault by an illegitimate Supreme Court majority on woman’s rights, reproductive rights, martial rights, family planning rights, civil rights, voting rights, labor rights, and the right to liberty and justice for all,” stated Rep.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) pointed out Justice Alito’s majority opinion provided no indication the court was eyeing to repeal gay or interracial marriage among the other issues Democrats cited.Republican lawmakers turned their attention to the recent attacks on pro-life pregnancy centers that offer education, free ultrasounds, prenatal vitamins and baby clothes to women seeking to give birth. This comes as more than 50 pregnancy centers nationwide have been vandalized since the momentous supreme court decision.Wow.  @cateici tells the Judiciary Committee that she had to hire private security guards to protect her after she received threats for testifying on pro-life issues before the Committee.

The industry has reportedly lost 20 percent of its workforce since 2017, which led to under staffing and longer hours for employees that stay.The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway is the largest Class I railroad in the country and is one of the two major freight railroads in Wyoming. It employs about 40,000 people and operates in 28 states on over 32,000 miles of track throughout its system.The railroad has been one of the major economic drivers and employers for many of the Wyoming communities it passes through. Many owe their existence to it. In February, BNSF instituted an attendance policy known as Hi-Viz, which drew immediate criticism from employees and railroad unions. Kevin Knutson is a Gillette-based conductor and union leader who has worked for the railroad for over 40 years. He said the policy is very stringent.“The attendance policy we had in the past, it would allow basically any person to take two weekend days and five weekdays per month off,” explained Knutson. “This policy that they have now, cut that in half and in half. For instance, if I took off every other Sunday, no other days, I would be dismissed by the end of the year.”BNSF said more than 50 percent of train crew employees work less than 40 hours on average","MIAMI, FL – MAY 24: An Amtrak train is seen as people board at the Miami station on May 24, 2017 in Miami, Florida.

(AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:12 PM PT – Friday, July 15, 2022A new suicide prevention lifeline is launching nationwide. Starting Saturday, the code 988 will be available for call or text as the Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline. The line will remain open around the clock and anyone who wants to talk about their struggles can speak to a trained counselor.“Our goal is to make 988 like 911,” Secretary Xavier Becerra said. “If you are willing to turn to someone in your moment of crisis, someone will be there. 988 won’t be a busy signal. 988 will get you help. That is the goal.” The 988 Suicide and Crisis Line launches tomorrow. Suicide is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 10 to 34. With this new, around the clock crisis line, countless lives will be saved. #988Lifeline pic.twitter.com/0mACjhQTfH— Rep. Alma Adams (@RepAdams) July 15, 2022At the same time, advocates hope the renewed focus on emergency assistance and the spending that has accompanied it will prompt expansion of other mental health services that are in desperately short supply in many communities.“I look at 988 as a starting place where we can really re-imagine mental health care,” said Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “We’re really looking at a fundamental tide shift in how we respond to people in mental health crisis.”The number of suicides in the United States rose steadily from 29,350 in 2000 to 48,344 in 2018 before declining to 45,979 in 2020, according to the National Center on Health Statistics. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and other factors, government and health officials agree that the country is in the grip of a mental health crisis, especially among younger people with sharply rising rates of depression and anxiety.The lifeline has been in operation under a ten digit number since 2005 and has reportedly taken over 20 million calls since. Officials predict those numbers are going to increase with the transition to a three digit number.","In this Sunday, Aug. 11, 2019, photo, a man uses a cell phone in New Orleans.

He urged Americans to remember what people have said about Biden for the last 40 years: that every foreign policy decision he’s made has been wrong.Meanwhile, Sen.

In a statement Friday, the Wyoming lawmaker noted, “President Biden is going halfway around the world looking for a solution found right here at home.President Biden is going halfway around the world looking for a solution found right here at home.

He acknowledged that a two-state solution will not be a reality anytime soon, but pledged to not give up on pursuing it.“There must be a political horizon the Palestinian people can actually see or at least feel,” Biden said. “We cannot allow the hopelessness to steal away the future that so many have worked toward for so long. So even if the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations, the United States and my administration will not give up on trying to bring the Palestinians and Israelis and both sides closer together.”This comes as the Biden administration announced Thursday that it is providing $316 million in additional aid to the Palestinian authority, including around $200 million for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees.The administration also proposed a multi-year contribution of $100 million for the East Jerusalem Hospitals Network, which provides medical care ranging from oncological care to emergency services for 50,000 local patients, though the funding would require authorization from Congress.Furthermore, Israelis are in the midst of more political chaos after the government’s collapse last month. The country is headed for its fifth election in under four years and the polls show yet another toss-up. That opens the possibility for a return to power for Benjamin Netanyahu, an antagonist to a peace deal that isn’t lopsided in Israel’s favor.","U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a joint statement with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Friday, July 15, 2022.
