1:15 PM PT",Biden signs bipartisan gun control bill into law,"President Joe Biden signed the most sweeping gun control bill in decades. On Saturday, Biden said while the bill doesn’t have everything he wanted, it includes actions he’s long called for that are going to save lives.“Lives will be saved,” the President said. “Their message to us was to do something. Well today, we did.”The house passed a compromise made by a group of bipartisan Senators on Friday, which included enhanced background checks for buyers under 21 and provides federal funding for states to implement “Red Flag” laws. Biden signed the measure two days after the Supreme Court’s ruling struck down a New York law that restricted people’s ability to carry concealed weapons.I just signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. While this bill doesn't do everything I want it to, it does include actions that I've long called for that will save lives.Today, we acted for the families that have lost their souls to an epidemic of gun violence. pic.twitter.com/QWg3orWuS1— President Biden (@POTUS) June 25, 2022“From Columbine to Sandy Hook to Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland, El Paso, Atlanta, Buffalo, Uvalde,” Biden voiced. “For the shootings that happen every day in the streets that are mass shootings we don’t even hear about.”It also gets rid of the so called “boyfriend loophole,” prohibiting those convicted of domestic abuse from owing a firearm. Most of the $13 billion cost will help bolster mental health programs and aid schools, which have been targeted in Newtown, Connecticut, Parkland, Florida and elsewhere in mass shootings.Tune in as I sign into law S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and deliver remarks on reducing gun violence and saving lives. https://t.co/evfofKN84e— President Biden (@POTUS) June 25, 2022“I know there’s much more work to do,” he stated. “I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”The new law does not include tougher restrictions long championed by Democrats, such as a ban on assault style weapons and background checks for all gun transactions. However, it is the most impactful firearms violence measure produced by Congress since enactment of a long expired assault weapons ban in 1993.Biden went on to say he will host an event for lawmakers and families affected by gun violence on July 11.TOPICS:boyfriend loopholegun lawsJill BidenJoe Bidenmass shootingmental healthnewsnewtonOANOANNuvaldeWhite House SHARETWEETPINSHARE","President Joe Biden signs into law S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act gun safety bill, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Saturday, June 25, 2022.

In Wisconsin, that means a statute passed in 1849 that created penalties with no exceptions made for cases of rape or incest.Last month, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin also said it planned to work with the organization’s Illinois chapter to arrange for abortion services in that state, where it is still legal up to the point of the fetus being considered viable.“Although abortion services are not available in Wisconsin for now, Planned Parenthood’s doors across the state are open and we are here to help patients get the care they need,” the PPH President voiced. “This includes helping patients access safe abortion care where it remains legal, offering travel assistance and providing appropriate follow-up care when they return home. Your health and the health of the community is our number one priority.”The Wisconsin Attorney General has vowed to not enforce penalties for administering abortions and has called on other law enforcement agencies to follow suit. 26 states are expected to restrict abortion access in response to the verdict.","Abortion rights supporters gather for a “pink out” protest organized by Planned Parenthood in the rotunda of the state Capitol Wednesday, June 22, 2022, in Madison, Wis.

The Congresswoman has broken with establishment Republicans by taking the words “shall not be infringed upon'” literally, as Democrat-backed policies have made the country less safe.“We’re not going to send police to protect you,” she voiced. “I will not give an inch of the Second Amendment of the rights of the people to keep and bare arms to protect themselves, especially when cries from this chamber are calling to defund law enforcement and our southern border is wide open.”The firebrand also has a less than conventional way of illustrating what a tyrannical government can do to a defenseless population. Boebert is especially passionate about the Amendment she exercises on the House floor, the right to free speech.The Coloradan has long been a critic of the administration’s policing of the COVID narrative and the DHS’s persecution of parents at school board meetings. In reaction to Biden’s so-called disinformation task force, Boebert and her colleagues introduced the “Protecting Free Speech Act” to ensure the United States does not follow in the footsteps of Maoist China and Stalin’s Soviet Union.“Now is when we the people make our voices heard,” The Congresswoman expressed. “We will not accept being called domestic terrorists for showing up to school boards and we sure as hack won’t allow these Bureaucrats to create a ministry of truth to gaslight the American people.”President Trump has formally endorsed Rep.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:47 PM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022Governor Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) forced the media to eat crow after his former opponent was indicted on federal charges. The DOJ charged Democrat Andrew Gillum with 21 counts on Wednesday.On Thursday, DeSantis was asked if he felt vindicated after being called a liar and a racist for bringing up the FBI probe into Gillum during the 2018 gubernatorial race. DeSantis responded by asking the media if they had any type of “mea culpa” for glorifying Gillum.“There were clearly a lot of issues there,” DeSantis voiced. “If you looked under the hood you saw it. What was presented to the public was that this guy was like the second coming. Never has a candidate been elevated that way by media outlets. Certainly not in the last 10 years or so. I can tell you if I had not won in 2018, this state would be in much worse shape and that’s not even a question.”According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Northern District of Florida, Gillum is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and making false statements to the FBI. Gillum served as mayor between 2014 and 2018. The 21 count indictment alleges that the crimes took place between 2016 and 2019, which covers most of the time Gillum was in office.“I have spent the last 20 years of my life in public service and continue to fight for the people,” Gillum said in a statement. “Every campaign I’ve run has been done with integrity. Make no mistake that this case is not legal, it is political. Throughout my career I have always stood up for the people of Florida and have spoken truth to power. There’s been a target on my back ever since I was the mayor of Tallahassee. They found nothing then, and I have full confidence that my legal team will prove my innocence now.”Andrew Gillum was indicted for stealing huge amounts of campaign money. This self-serving corruption is what campaign finance laws were passed to stop. I was prosecuted for giving away too much of my own money. Yet the leftists who shriek at me for this are silent about Gillum— Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) June 23, 2022Gillum entered rehab in 2020 after police found him in a Miami Beach Hotel with a male prostitute overdosing on drugs. An initial appearance is scheduled for Wednesday at 2 p.m. at the U.S. Courthouse in Tallahassee.","Florida Gov.

The DC circuit appeals court granted Juul’s request to stay in what the company called an “extraordinary and unlawful action.”The move came less than a day after the FDA said findings raised “significant questions” about potential risks from consumers using their products. The e-cigarette company said the decision lacks evidence and they are now allowed to continue selling products as the court further deliberates Juul’s case.In 2019, Juul was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating its fruit and dessert flavors after they became popular among middle and high school students. The next year, the FDA limited flavors in small vaping devices to just tobacco and menthol.Chief Regulatory Officer at Juul Labs Joe Murillo said in a statement to Axios that the company would seek a stay and explore other options “under the FDA’s regulations and the law, including appealing the decision and engaging with our regulator.”Juul said that the FDA cannot argue that there was a “critical and urgent public interest” in immediately removing its products from the market when the agency allowed them to be sold during its review.Meanwhile, the court noted their decision should not be interpreted as a ruling on the merits of the motion.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22175613121103.jpg," Ghislaine Maxwell Placed On Suicide Watch, But Isn’t SuicidalTOPICS:bancourtFDAJuullabsnewsOANOANNSmoking SHARETWEETPINSHARE",https://www.oann.com/federal-court-blocks-fda-ban-on-juul-products/

Mary Miller (R) in Illinois. At Saturday’s rally in Western Illinois, he came right out the gate to declare that the people of the state would help fire Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).“You’re going to elect a slate of rock solid conservatives up and down the ballot and together we are going to end Nancy Pelosi,” said Trump. “She’s crazy.

Trump said that they are proving that their are two systems of Justice in the country as the Democrats are running January 6 show trials, while keeping silent on judicial intimidation.“There can be no greater illustration of the two tiered system of justice,” voiced the former president. “We’ve never had anything like what’s going on right now. At the moment the radical Democrats are staging a ridiculous fake trial over January 6. Their party leaders are saying nothing about the violent intimidation of the united states Supreme Court.”Thank you President Trump! pic.twitter.com/RQjB5dFRDv— Mary Miller (@Miller_Congress) June 26, 2022According to Trump, the root of America’s problems goes right back to November 2020 when Democrats used COVID to rig the presidential election and force him out of office.“They refuse to mention the election fraud and all the irregularities,” he voiced. “There has never been anything like what took place in 2020. They used COVID to rig and steal an election.”He said that the best way to oppose Nancy Pelosi’s committee and the “RINO’s” who support it is to vote for Mary Miller to continue on in the 15th Congressional District. In a surprise to many, the president gave his full endorsement to gubernatorial candidate and State Senator Darren Bailey (R-Ill.). Bailey is running to unseat Democrat JB Pritzker. He believes Bailey is just the man to win where other ‘republicans’ may not.“No matter how big or powerful these corrupt radicals may be, you must never forget this nation does not belong to them, this nation belongs to you,” he declared. “We will make America great again!”BREAKING NEWS: President Trump's rally has reportedly broken attendance Illinois records for a political event.

(Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette via AP, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:00 PM PT – Sunday, June 26, 2022An incumbent Republican in Oklahoma is fighting for another term in Congress. Rep. Frank Lucas is asking the voters of Oklahoma for another term in Washington D.C. to advocate for taxpayers.The Congressman is the longest serving House member from the state and a ranking minority member of the science, space and technology committee. Lucas has been representing his constituents in public office since 1994.First serving in Oklahoma’s sixth Congressional District, then representing the third Congressional District since 2003. He touted that Oklahomans know they have a strong conservative voice in Congress when he’s in Washington D.C.“I believe in Frank Lucas, he’s a great man,” said a friend of the Congressman.Lucas is perhaps best known for being an advocate for farmers and ranchers. At a House committee hearing on financial services in March, Lucas illustrated how out of touch Democrats truly are with rural America. The Congressman emphasized in the hearing that when you increase the amount of money chasing goods and services, it drives up the price and it impacts farmers.“If you dramatically increase the amount of money chasing the same or fewer goods and services, then you drive up the price of the goods and services,” Lucas stated. “Farmers across the country are experiencing higher cost for chemicals, seeds, fertilizer, equipment, fuel and labor, among other increased input cost. The squeeze and uncertainty felt by farmers and ranchers right now will be felt for years to come. This means higher food prices we see now may be with us for some time.”The fifth generation Oklahoman received the official Trump endorsement in April. The former president affirmed that Lucas promotes American farmers, defends the Second Amendment, supports military Veterans and encourages innovation.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/farm.jpeg, Pres.

(United Nations Photo/Rick Bajornas via AP)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 4:00 PM PT – Sunday, June 26, 2022Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has been placed on suicide watch, though she’s reportedly not even suicidal. A letter filed by Maxwell’s attorney warns they’ll formally move for an adjournment on Monday if Maxwell is prohibited from reviewing legal materials prior to sentencing.“She is not suicidal,” said her lawyer Bobbi Sternheim. “A psychologist evaluated Ms. Maxwell and determined she is not.”The British socialite was convicted for helping recruit and sexually abuse girls for disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Each charge Maxwell faces carries a maximum prison term from five to 40 years in prison. Earlier this month, her attorneys wrote to the sentencing judge in a bid for leniency.Don’t let the Roe V Wade protests distract you from the fact that Ghislaine Maxwell was just placed on suicide watch.— Harrison Krank (@HarrisonKrank) June 26, 2022She is due for sentencing in a Manhattan Federal Court on Tuesday and attorney’s allege she hasn’t been able to properly prepare. If her conditions do not change and should she become sleep deprived and not have sufficient time to meet with her defense team, Sternheim said he would request that her hearing be postponed.“Ms. Maxwell has already experienced hard time during detention under conditions far more onerous and punitive than any experienced by a typical pretrial detainee,” her attorney stated. “She is preparing to spend significantly more time behind bars. Her life has been ruined. Since Epstein’s death, her life has been threatened and death threats continue while she is incarcerated. It would be a travesty of Justice for her to face a sentence that would have been appropriate for Epstein.”Officials said she was abruptly placed in solitary confinement and placed on suicide watch “without justification”.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ghislaine-Maxwell.jpeg, Pres.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:05 PM PT – Sunday, June 26, 2022Governor Kristi Noem said South Dakota will prosecute doctors who perform abortions in the state. On Sunday, Noem assured prosecution will only focus toward doctors who knowingly break the law and not the mother.“We’ll continue to have those debates on how we can support these mothers and what it means to really make sure we are not prosecuting mothers ever in a situation like this,” Noem said. “Prosecution will always be focused toward those doctors who knowingly break the law to perform abortions in our state.”In South Dakota, we value life.

There are no other exceptions, including for rape or incest.“These are very dangerous medical procedures,” Noem voiced. “We don’t believe it should be available, because it is a dangerous situation for those individuals .”She also plans to ban telemedicine appointments, in order to prevent abortion pills from being prescribed online and sent through the mail.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:48 PM PT – Saturday, June 25, 2022Trigger laws took effect in several states quickly after the Roe reversal. Republican-run states across the nation moved quickly to ban abortions following the Supreme Courts ruling.Thirteen states have passed “trigger laws” that ban abortions designed to automatically take effect once Court Justices struck down Roe v. Wade. At least eight enacted a ban the day of Friday’s ruling. Missouri’s Attorney General Eric Schmitt certified outlawing most abortions just minutes after the decision. He said the state was the first in the nation to effectively end the procedure.“The one thing about it is your not doing away with it either,” said Governor Mike Parson (R-Mo.). We may be in this state but there’s other places to go if people want to do that in time, but right now this is something some of us have all worked hard for. I hope people respect this one and behave accordingly.”🚨BREAKING: With the Dobbs decision just handed down and a stroke of my pen — Missouri became the first state to effectively end abortion and has become the most Pro Life state in America. pic.twitter.com/8asHJKMIdo— Eric Schmitt (@Eric_Schmitt) June 24, 2022Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and Alabama followed suit. All of those states allow abortions in cases of medical emergency, which makes those performing it a felony punishable by years in prison. Women undergoing the procedure cannot be prosecuted. In Texas, Tennessee, North Dakota, Mississippi and Idaho trigger bans are expected to take effect in the coming weeks.“With it now in place we don’t need a special session to be called,” stated Amy O’Donnell, Author at Texas Alliance for Life. “We don’t need the attorney general to make any kind of statement. It simply is the law. It doesn’t take effect immediately, it actually takes effect 30 days after the  final judgment is rendered.”According to the Washington Post, abortion has been legal and will likely remain protected in at least 20 states and the District of Columbia. Meanwhile, tens of thousands continue to protest as the overturn of Roe sent shockwaves across the nation.",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22176633007421.jpg, Va.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 6:00 PM PT – Saturday, June 25, 2022Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin (R) vowed to find middle ground when it comes to the issue of abortion. On Friday, Youngkin spoke to the Washington Post and said he’ll push an abortion ban after 15 weeks. He admitted the divided state legislature would likely pass a ban after 20 weeks. Youngkin asked four Virginia lawmakers who are all anti-abortion Republicans to craft legislation.“Virginians elected a pro-life governor and he supports finding consensus on legislation,” Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter said in a statement. “He has tapped Senator Siobhan Dunnavant, Senator Steve Newman, Delegate Kathy Byron and Delegate Margaret Ransone to do so and prioritize protecting life when babies begin to feel pain in the womb, including a 15 week threshold.”My statement on Supreme Court’s Dobbs Ruling Announcement: pic.twitter.com/JA6N2UGDxi— Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) June 24, 2022Youngkin welcomed the high court’s ruling as an “appropriate” return of power to the states. Youngkin’s policy announcement is his most explicit policy statement to date. This was an issue that he tried to avoid during last year’s campaign. It only seemed to aggravate the partisan divide.“Virginians do want fewer abortions as opposed to more abortions,” Youngkin voiced. “I am not someone who is going to jump in and try to push us apart, there is a place we can come together.”In D.C. and Maryland Democratic leaders criticized the ruling and pledged to safeguard abortion access rights. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said via email that his state passed laws 30 years ago to protect access to abortion.“I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and the laws of Maryland,” Hogan declared. That is what I have always done and will continue to do as governor.”Youngkin added that he supports exceptions for rape, incest and if the mother’s life is in danger",,https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/AP22172637164794.jpg, D.C.
