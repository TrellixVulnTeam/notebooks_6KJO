8:38 AM PT",Uber Files: Biden lobbied by tech giant despite illegal actions,"The Biden administration is embroiled in a scandal over alleged unethical lobbying practices by ride-share company Uber. The Guardian obtained more than 124,000 confidential internal documents from Uber that show the company attempted to lobby Biden and other global leaders while hiding information from law enforcement.The leaked documents show Uber breached laws and regulations to enter the taxi market between 2013 and 2017. In addition, the company’s executives met with Biden, who was vice president at the time, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.“Joe Biden and something like a dozen of former staffers of the Obama administration, some of them quite senior, were the embrace of the Uber model, which by definition offends labor protections and labor rights was striking to me,” stated Dean Starkman, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Uber CEO: “I’ve had my people let him know that every minute late [Biden] is, is one less minute he will have with me.”So Uber's CEO recognizes the value of waiting time after all!

In a Senate floor speech Monday, the Kentucky lawmaker accused Democrats of wanting to redesign the economy along purely partisan lines through reconciliation.McConnell also called out Democrats for seeking to raise taxes on “pass through” firms, which he asserted comprises 95 percent of all American businesses and three-quarters of small employers. The top Republican contended that Democrats are floating “ruinous policies” when the country is already on the brink of a recession.“Democrats created a runaway inflationary tax hike with their reckless spending last year, 2021, and now they want to come after the American people a second time with a huge, new tax hike,” he stated. “In other words, Democrats have already picked the American people’s pocket once and now their solution is to pick your pockets a second time. First, with inflation and now with tax hikes.”﻿McConnell also warned Democrats passing partisan tax hikes would “paralyze” the Senate putting bipartisan proposals on China and other issues in jeopardy.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks with reporters following a closed-door caucus lunch, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 22, 2022.

According to reports, the US official made a last minute stop in Tokyo and met with current Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to pay tribute to the late politician.Ahead of his trip, Blinken noted that the US Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and has never been stronger. This comes as Abe was assassinated by a gunman in broad daylight while he was giving a speech last week.“We saw in him something rare, a man of vision who had the ability to realize that vision,” Blinken stated. “But mostly, I came at the President’s behest because more than allies, we are friends. And when a friend is hurting, other friends show up. We try to help ease the burden, share the sense of loss.”Shortly after Abe was pronounced dead, Blinken met in Bali with Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa and South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin to review strategy mainly related to North Korea. He added that Abe’s death had shaken the G20 meeting and left many of his foreign minister colleagues expressing shock and distress at the news.Per pool: Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he shares ""the very deep condolences of the United States"" with his Japanese counterpart, adding, ""this is shocking… he [Abe] brought the relationship between the U.S. and Japan to new heights during his time in office.""

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:55 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Texas officials came to an agreement on releasing surveillance video from the Uvalde school shooting. On Monday, state and local agencies reached a compromise regarding the images from the May 24 mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers.“I can tell people all day long what it is I saw, the committee can tell people all day long what we saw, but it’s very different to see it for yourself,” Texas Rep. Dustin Burrows (R) stated.Law enforcement officers and the mayor of Uvalde have been arguing for weeks on how to handle the delicate matter. They ultimately agreed that some parts of the video should be available to the public.“This video would be of the hallway footage from Robb Elementary School,” he said. “It would contain no graphic images or depictions of violence. The video would begin after the shooter enters the room and end before a breach of that room, while giving stark insight into what officers did for more than an hour before confronting the gunman that day.”BREAKING REPORT: Uvalde mayor says he BACKS PLAN to release 77-minute hallway video showing how elementary school massacre unfolded while cops stood by and did nothing…— Chuck Callesto (@ChuckCallesto) July 9, 2022Questions still remain about the time officers arrived on the scene that fateful day and why they waited 77 minutes before breaching the classroom. Over the weekend, Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin accused Uvalde-area District Attorney Christina Busbee of misleading family members about McLaughlin’s support for releasing certain footage that showed the police response during the rampage.“We do not believe the video’s public release would harm our investigative efforts,” the Public Safety Department’s Deputy Director of Homeland Security Operations Martin Freeman wrote in a letter to Burrows. “In fact, releasing this video would assist us in providing as much transparency as possible to the public.”It’s 105 degrees in Uvalde and there hundreds of people marching. pic.twitter.com/nPPbbAbxIj— Jose Arredondo (@sportsguyjose) July 10, 2022Burrows has not said when the video would be released.","Family and friends of those killed and injured in the school shooting at Robb Elementary take part in a protest march and rally, Sunday, July 10, 2022, in Uvalde, Texas.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:05 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022The ever-growing crisis at the southern borders reached new highs. A new Breitbart report showed Texas Border Patrol agents apprehended around 26,000 migrants in less than a week who crossed into border towns.The recent spike in arrests prompted Governor Greg Abbott (R-Texas) to sign an “invasion” executive order allowing the Texas National Guard and Texas DPS to send those migrants back to the border where they can return to Mexico. He and other GOP politicians have piled blame onto the Biden administration for failing to secure the southwestern border.“While President Biden refuses to do his job and enforce the immigration laws enacted by Congress, the State of Texas is once again stepping up and taking unprecedented action to protect Americans and secure our southern border,” said Abbott. “The cartels have become emboldened and enriched by President Biden’s open border policies, smuggling in record numbers of people, weapons, and deadly drugs like fentanyl.”The arrests took place in the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, Del Rio, Big Bend and El Paso sectors. According to Monday’s report, of the 26,000 migrants apprehended 10,000 were in the Texas border town of Eagle Pass. The Del Rio border sector saw the largest share with 12,000 migrants being apprehended by border agents there.“As the challenges on the border continue to increase, Texas will continue to take action and address those challenges,” he stated.I issued an Executive Order authorizing the Texas National Guard & Texas Dept. of Public Safety to return illegal immigrants to the border.Cartels have become emboldened by Biden's open border policies.Texas is taking unprecedented action to STOP this criminal enterprise. pic.twitter.com/ag08ACYP3Y— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) July 7, 2022In addition, 70 percent of the migrants apprehended in Texas were single adults.","FILE – A line of Texas Department of Safety vehicles line up on the Texas side of the Rio Grande with Mexico visible, right, near an encampment of migrants, many from Haiti, on Sept. 22, 2021, in Del Rio, Texas.

In the New York Times and Siena College survey released Monday, 64 percent of respondents said they would prefer the party have a new presidential nominee in 2024.Respondents cited Biden’s age and job performance as the top two reasons for wanting another nominee.The poll also notably found 94 percent of respondents under the age of 30 believe Democrats should nominate someone other than Biden who is the oldest president in US history. This comes as Biden continues to face tough criticism over his behavior, in turn, sparking new concerns about his mental fitness for office.Joe Biden reading off the teleprompter: ""…end of quote. Repeat the line.""This is getting embarrassing for our country. pic.twitter.com/SWh0cJqzOI— Brian Mast (@BrianMastFL) July 8, 2022In a Truth Social post on Sunday, 45th President Donald Trump noted there are a lot of people Biden’s age and older who are as good and sharp as ever. However, Trump said Biden is not one of them. Trump stressed that Biden’s cognitive and mental problems have nothing to do with his age and he quipped life doesn’t truly begin until 80.To add fuel to the fire, it appears Biden has become the most hated president in the past 75 years as America faces deepening economic and social crises. According to FiveThirtyEight polling Monday, Biden’s approval rating of 38 percent is the lowest among all presidents since 1945 except Harry Truman.Back in 1946, Truman’s rating was 33 percent. This can be compared to Trump’s rating of 42 percent at the same point in his presidency along with Richard Nixon’s rating of 54 percent and Dwight Eisenhower’s rating of 70 percent. The poll also shows Republican presidents fared better during their second year in office than their Democrat counterparts.","President Joe Biden speaks during an event to celebrate the passage of the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” a law meant to reduce gun violence, on the South Lawn of the White House, Monday, July 11, 2022, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Monday, July 11, 2022Vice President Kamala Harris suggested American citizens should not have access to certain firearms and called for further restrictions. In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Harris was asked about the recent assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.“I was shocked for so many reasons,” Harris said. “Beginning with the fact that Prime Minister Abe was a great friend to the United States through many administrations. Our President Joe Biden is very, very fond of him and knew him well.”She offered condolences and addressed the troubling nature of his death, but did not comment on Japan’s strict gun laws. Instead she steered the conversation to the US and declared that no American would own a high powered rifle unless they had plans to murder people.“Assault weapons were specifically and intentionally designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly,” she stated. “It is a weapon of war. If you’ve ever looked at, if I may be so blunt, an autopsy photograph to see what it does to the human body. The fact that we can’t get Congress to renew.  It’s not like we’re pulling something out of our hat. We’ve done it before as a nation to renew the assault weapons ban, is outrageous.”We cannot allow our nation to live in fear of gun violence anymore.

The time for change is now. pic.twitter.com/2K1Q0UyOfO— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 9, 2022The Democrat went on to suggest that if the weapons weren’t legally available mass shootings wouldn’t happen. Although Democrats control both chambers of Congress, any major gun reform legislation would require 60 votes in the Senate. That means that at least 10 Republicans would have to sign on to legislation for it to be viable.“We have to stop allowing those weapons to be available to civilians living in communities who have a right to believe that they are not in a war zone,” she voiced.The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is long overdue.This law will take reasonable steps to help prevent gun violence in America. And it will save lives.— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 11, 2022The Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, specifically outlawed 19 types of semi-automatic firearms, as well as other rifles, shotguns and handguns that possess two or more of a certain set of features. This included pistol grips, detachable magazines and sound suppressors. The maximum capacity of a magazine was also set at 10 rounds. The vice president went on to speak about her experience visiting Highland Park in Illinois where the tragic July 4 mass shooting took place.“You can support the Second Amendment, I support the Second Amendment,” she expressed. “But we should agree we should not have weapons of war on the streets of America. Sadly a toddler lost both his parents. When I got to the scene I was greeted by the mayor, the chief and the first responders who told me that story. I can’t even imagine what this is going to mean for the life of that child.”The call for common-sense gun violence legislation is long overdue. Today we celebrate the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. https://t.co/YhxKmfvBHX— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) July 11, 2022Harris said recent suspects have been able to slip past “red flag” laws simply because guns are available.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:22 AM PT – Wednesday, July 13, 2022Senate Republicans are addressing concerns over a potential attempt by Democrats to revive their Build Back Better agenda. While speaking to the press Tuesday, GOP leadership addressed the matter while asserting their colleagues on the left are attempting to solve the economic crisis by spending more money.“We’ve got rampant, runaway inflation,” stated Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). “The American people are paying the price and what is the Democrat prescription? To double down, to spend more and to tax more.”The alleged new spending package could supposedly cut the initial cost by $1 trillion and aims to focus on health care costs and energy. However, this would require raising taxes, which would primarily hit business owners and corporations.“Now they want to pour fuel on the flames by making it more likely that we go into a recession by raising taxes on all of these businesses,” explained Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “The vast majority of businesses in America, which will only cause them to reduce the number of employees.”Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who was said by Democrats to have killed the bill last year, has reportedly been in talks with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recently. Democrats are looking at reducing the cost of prescription drugs within the revised package, which is a priority Manchin supports. However, Sen. Thune said Democrats real “prescription” won’t benefit the American people.“We’re talking about higher taxes on the American people, higher taxes on businesses, higher prices and lower wages,” stressed the South Dakota Republican. “That’s the Democrat prescription.”According to reports, Democrats hope to pass the revised bill before September by using the budget reconciliation process. However, Republicans are worried there could be long lasting effects if a spending package like this is passed.“The American people have had enough,” Thune stated. “And I hope there are a couple of wise Democrats who will sink this really bad idea and make sure that we don’t go down a path that leads to even more economic tumult the American people are already feeling.”LIVE: The Senate Republican leadership team speaks to the press.

This comes as the Biden administration has begged authoritarian governments in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for oil instead of America’s allies. Meanwhile, Lopez Obrador stressed he’s saving Americans in border towns some money by letting them cross the border to buy cheaper gas.“While prices of gasoline goes down in the United States, I hope that Congress approves your proposal of (lowering gas prices),” he stated. “In the meantime, while we’re waiting for gasoline prices to go down, we are allowing Americans who live near our border to fill up their vehicles (with gasoline) on the Mexican side at lower prices.”Additionally, the Mexican president slammed the state of the US-Mexico border. He said the Biden administration needs to take steps to transform the border and move away from the status quo. Lopez Obrador proposed the Biden administration to create new pathways for Mexican and Central American nationals to gain legal entry into the US. He explained that he hopes this will reduce “irregular migration patterns while opening up new economic opportunities.”Last week, there were over 13,000 illegal crossings in the Del Rio sector and 8,400 in the Rio Grande Valley.Our border is porous, and thousands are flooding across. Yet Biden still wants to end the Remain in Mexico Policy and Title 42.We need a competent border policy.— Chuck Fleischmann (@RepChuck) July 12, 2022 The Biden administration has seen record levels of illegal immigration, resulting in the exhaustion of border patrol resources and the deaths of migrants. Just last month, more than 50 migrants were found dead in a tractor trailer in San Antonio, Texas. Lopez Obrador confirmed most of those migrants were Mexican nationals and stressed the need for better border security is urgent.“Regularize now and give certainty to migrants who, since many years, work in an honest manner and contribute to the development of this great nation,” he stressed.The socialist president also praised Mexican citizens, touting their work in America bolsters the economies of both the US and Mexico.“I just want to tell you that I love you very much, that love is repaid with love,” stated Lopez Obrador. “That tomorrow at the White House we are going to talk about the rights of migrants and that we love you very much for all that you do, because you work here and you send money to your families. And thanks to that, our economy is getting back on its feet.”In the meantime, the two presidents agreed on a $1.5 billion package to improve “smart technologies” at America’s southern border. Biden also claimed he has launched a multi-lateral operation to take down human and drug smugglers that he claims has already led to the arrests of more than 3,000 smugglers. Lopez Obrador highlighted the importance of cooperation between the US and Mexico.","President Joe Biden listens as Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, July 12, 2022.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:04 PM PT – Tuesday, July 12, 2022The White House held an event touting its efforts to significantly tighten gun control laws. President Joe Biden celebrated increased restrictions on the Second Amendment while signing bipartisan legislation, which narrowly passed through CongressWhile speaking on the White House Lawn on Monday, Biden praised his signing of a gun control bill, which tightens background checks for anyone under the age of 21. The move came after the US recently bore witness to mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York.“This new law requiring requires young people under 21 to go into enhanced background checks before purchasing a gun,” Biden stated. “How many more mass shootings do we have to see where a shooter is 17, 18-years-old and able to get his hands on a weapon and go on a killing spree? You know, it closes the so-called boyfriend loophole.”Additionally, he claimed to be a supporter of the Second Amendment, despite making past statements about the amendment not being absolute. Biden also justified his actions by citing a report from the CDC, saying gun violence is the leading cause of death for children in the US. Critics have pointed out flaws in the assessment, noting it doesn’t discriminate between different age groupshttps://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1546665940879900674Biden then went on to encourage an assault weapons ban while also calling on Congress to pass legislation making gun owners liable if they don’t secure their firearms in their homes.“I’m not going to stop until we do it,” he stated. “We should have safe storage laws requiring personal liability for not locking up your gun…responsible gun owners agree no one else should have access to it. So lock it up. Have trigger locks. And if you don’t and something bad happens, you should be held responsible.”The action we take today on gun violence is a step designed to make our nation the kind of nation it should be.It's about the most fundamental things: the lives of our children and our loved ones. pic.twitter.com/GRL2KhBDcA— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 11, 2022","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks during an event to celebrate the passage of the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,” a law meant to reduce gun violence, on the South Lawn of the White House, July 11, 2022, in Washington.
