11:45 AM PT",Rep. Boebert looks to put America first for two more years in Congress,"Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) is running for re-election to continue fighting for Colorado’s Third District in Congress. Since being sworn into office in January of 2021, Boebert has been both a champion for the “Save America Movement” and a staunch opponent of the progressive policies of the Biden administration.We're less than a week out from primary day – votes are already being cast!Help me win this race & continue to fight for our rights. When we're in a majority next year, Biden's agenda is going to screech to a halt!Donate today – help this campaign win!https://t.co/ORFn5nQFsl— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) June 23, 2022She has been quick to point out the inconsistencies in Democrat COVID policies such as masking small children in schools, while allowing migrants to flood into the country with a single COVID test or vaccine card. The Republican isn’t just worried about the people coming across the southern border. In order to combat the nation’s leading cause of death for those aged 18 to 45, Boebert has introduced legislation to classify Fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.“Take my home state of Colorado,” said Boebert. “In 2019 there were 222 deaths, in 2020 there were 540 and now in 2021 there were more than 900 fentanyl related deaths. Moms, dads, sons, daughters, fentanyl does not discriminate and we need to take serious steps to combat this.”Inbox: “Rep. Lauren Boebert Introduces Legislation to Classify Fentanyl as a Weapon of Mass Destruction” pic.twitter.com/6To6NJrPXh— Adam Kredo (@Kredo0) June 13, 2022Boebert is also an avowed defender of the Second Amendment. The Congresswoman has broken with establishment Republicans by taking the words “shall not be infringed upon'” literally, as Democrat-backed policies have made the country less safe.“We’re not going to send police to protect you,” she voiced. “I will not give an inch of the Second Amendment of the rights of the people to keep and bare arms to protect themselves, especially when cries from this chamber are calling to defund law enforcement and our southern border is wide open.”The firebrand also has a less than conventional way of illustrating what a tyrannical government can do to a defenseless population. Boebert is especially passionate about the Amendment she exercises on the House floor, the right to free speech.The Coloradan has long been a critic of the administration’s policing of the COVID narrative and the DHS’s persecution of parents at school board meetings. In reaction to Biden’s so-called disinformation task force, Boebert and her colleagues introduced the “Protecting Free Speech Act” to ensure the United States does not follow in the footsteps of Maoist China and Stalin’s Soviet Union.“Now is when we the people make our voices heard,” The Congresswoman expressed. “We will not accept being called domestic terrorists for showing up to school boards and we sure as hack won’t allow these Bureaucrats to create a ministry of truth to gaslight the American people.”President Trump has formally endorsed Rep. Boebert’s re-election campaign. He called her a “fearless leader” and a fighter against “loser RINOs” and “radical Democrats.”","Rep.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:47 PM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022Governor Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) forced the media to eat crow after his former opponent was indicted on federal charges. The DOJ charged Democrat Andrew Gillum with 21 counts on Wednesday.On Thursday, DeSantis was asked if he felt vindicated after being called a liar and a racist for bringing up the FBI probe into Gillum during the 2018 gubernatorial race. DeSantis responded by asking the media if they had any type of “mea culpa” for glorifying Gillum.“There were clearly a lot of issues there,” DeSantis voiced. “If you looked under the hood you saw it. What was presented to the public was that this guy was like the second coming. Never has a candidate been elevated that way by media outlets. Certainly not in the last 10 years or so. I can tell you if I had not won in 2018, this state would be in much worse shape and that’s not even a question.”According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Northern District of Florida, Gillum is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and making false statements to the FBI. Gillum served as mayor between 2014 and 2018. The 21 count indictment alleges that the crimes took place between 2016 and 2019, which covers most of the time Gillum was in office.“I have spent the last 20 years of my life in public service and continue to fight for the people,” Gillum said in a statement. “Every campaign I’ve run has been done with integrity. Make no mistake that this case is not legal, it is political. Throughout my career I have always stood up for the people of Florida and have spoken truth to power. There’s been a target on my back ever since I was the mayor of Tallahassee. They found nothing then, and I have full confidence that my legal team will prove my innocence now.”Andrew Gillum was indicted for stealing huge amounts of campaign money. This self-serving corruption is what campaign finance laws were passed to stop. I was prosecuted for giving away too much of my own money. Yet the leftists who shriek at me for this are silent about Gillum— Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) June 23, 2022Gillum entered rehab in 2020 after police found him in a Miami Beach Hotel with a male prostitute overdosing on drugs. An initial appearance is scheduled for Wednesday at 2 p.m. at the U.S. Courthouse in Tallahassee.","Florida Gov.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 2:00 PM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022Justice Clarence Thomas said Dobbs could set precedent to overturn several landmark cases. In his concurring opinion issued on Friday, Thomas said all cases dealing with substantive due process precedents should be reconsidered.“In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,” voiced Thomas. “Any substantive due process decision is demonstrably erroneous. We have a duty to correct the error established in those precedents.”Thomas mentioned that the three cases are all landmark decisions that established certain constitutional rights. In Griswold v. Connecticut, the court ruled in 1965 that married couples have a right to access contraceptive. In 2003, the court said in Lawrence v. Texas that states could not outlaw consensual gay sex. The Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.He noted cases favoring contraception, same sex marriage and “homosexual conduct” could be overturned. This comes after the Supreme Court handed down an opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, arguing the right to an abortion is not a form of liberty under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.“I join the opinion of the Court because it correctly holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion,” he said. “Respondents invoke one source for that right. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Court well explains why under our substantive due process precedents the purported right to abortion is not a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. Such a right is neither deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition nor implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”In a solo concurring opinion, Thomas says the court should reconsider rulings that protect contraception, same-sex relationships, and same-sex marriage. pic.twitter.com/zcQNko6NVR— Matt Ford (@fordm) June 24, 2022Thomas claimed that it is the duty of the Court to correct these errors.","FILE – In this Feb. 15, 2018, file photo, Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas sits as he is introduced during an event at the Library of Congress in Washington.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 10:45 AM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022The Biden administration expressed frustration with the Supreme Court’s decision allowing Americans to carry handguns in public.“We are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s ruling,” stated Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre. “The Second Amendment, as you’ve heard the President (Joe Biden) say, is not obsolete and permits common-sense gun regulation.”In a press briefing Thursday, she said Biden is still calling on individual states to continue enforcing anti-gun policies. She cited New York as an example where a concealed carry law from the year 1911 was upheld by the Department of Justice.“Am I disappointed…I’ll answer this one question and I was just talking to the governor of New York about this,” stated Biden. “I am disappointed in the Supreme Court gun decision. There is one little bit of solace in the minority making up the majority opinion has laid out that it effects not every state, it effects only 40 states.”Republicans have said the Biden administration has no respect for the Supreme Court or other US institutions, adding Democrats seek to impose their own agenda by all means necessary.I'm deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court’s ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. This ruling contradicts common sense and the Constitution, and should deeply trouble us all. I remain committed to doing everything in my power to reduce gun violence.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 23, 2022Their remarks came after the US Senate advanced the bipartisan gun reform bill, clearing the way for its full approval by the end of this week. The Senate voted 65 to 34 on Thursday to break a filibuster on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, despite concerns it may violate the Second Amendment.“This bipartisan gun safety legislation is progress and will save lives,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “While it is not everything we want, this legislation is urgently needed.”The last significant federal gun control legislation was passed in 1994. It banned the manufacture for civilian use of assault rifles and large capacity ammunition clips.The bill will increase background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21. It also closes legal loopholes in buying firearms and will provide funding for mental health programs and security in schools. The blueprint will also call for funding to incentivize states to implement red flag laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat.This comes as the Supreme Court ruled to expand gun rights the same day, allowing American’s to carry firearms in public for self defense. However the National Rifle Association,  rejected the deal.“We will oppose this gun control legislation because it falls short at every level,” the NRA said in a statement. “It does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law abiding gun owners.”Proponents of the bill hope to get it passed before the July recess.","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Thursday, June 23, 2022.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 8:37 AM PT – Friday, June 24, 2022A gun activist in Chicago praised the Supreme Court’s ruling on a New York law, which restricted the carrying of handguns in public. While speaking to reporters on Thursday, Rhonda Ezell, the founder of the organization Chicago Guns Matter, spoke about the impact the court’s decision will have on gun rights.Ezell founded the organization after she won an appeal in her federal lawsuit against Chicago over the city’s ban on gun ranges. Prior to this, the Supreme Court struck down New York’s conceal carry law in a six to three decision.“This means a lot because our rights have been trampled out for decades,” said Ezell. “Even up to this day, they were still trying to impose more racist gun control measures that does nothing to stop the violence. All they want to do is disarm America for their little utopia of socialism and communism. In this case, here put a stamp onto that, it’s not going to happen and that they have to respect what the Second Amendment is.”The Second Amendment advocate then went on to describe how she felt about her court victory being referenced during the justice’s deliberation.“So, for our cases to be cited in this New York state rifle and pistol case, it means a lot to me as much as it does to anyone else in this country,” she noted.  “But it’s for everyone, it’s for all of us, because it’s going to set a precedent across this nation that we are not standing for tyranny from the political powers that be.”In the meantime, Ezell spoke about what she has in store for the future of Chicago Guns Matter.“I’m looking for someone to invest and bring a gun range in the city of Chicago, so that we can further educate the Black community — any community, all communities — because we want to get over the stigma of it’s taboo when you talk about firearm ownership in the Black community,” she continued.To everyone that likes to talk down on Chicago, today would be a great day to honor the work we've put forth in fighting to keep our freedoms in this country.Real Talk. https://t.co/3XzVYYnCbK— Ms. Ezell (@ms_ezell) June 23, 2022Meanwhile, the Senate passed a bipartisan gun control bill, which incentivizes funding for state red flag laws.

As the challenges confronting Biden intensify, his predictions of a rosy political future for the Democratic Party are growing bolder. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 5:44 PM PT – Thursday, June 23 2022The Biden administration struggled to convince consumers that they’re really attempting to bring down gas prices. On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris claimed officials were working to get gas prices under control.“Let me just tell you that the president and I, and our administration, is absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to bring down the cost of gas at the pump,” voiced Harris. However, President Joe Biden does not seem to be quite as optimistic.“The idea we’re going to be able to click a switch and bring down the cost of gasoline is not likely in the near term,” said Biden.Critics recently mocked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre for saying Biden is doing what he can to “alleviate” gas prices.“The President has been very clear in making sure that he does everything he can to alleviate the pain that American families are feeling when it comes to gas prices,” the secretary expressed.Despite this, the White House said they’re going to suspend the federal gas tax for 90 days in an effort to help consumers, which will allow families to feel a little bit of relief. A whole 18 cents per gallon of gas. However, critics have derided the move as they state even former President Barack Obama criticized the idea of a gas tax holiday during his presidential campaign in 2008, calling it a “gimmick” at the time.“For us to suggest that 30 cents a day, for 3 months is real relief, that that’s a real energy policy,” stated Obama. “It means that we are not tackling the problem that has to be tackled.”Additionally, Biden has called on states to provide relief to consumers by suspending the state gas tax, while continuing to blame the conflict in Ukraine for high gas prices and inflation. According to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Ukraine is not the driving force behind rising inflation.“Given how inflation has escalated over the past 18 months, would you say that the word Ukraine is the primary driver of inflation in America,?” questioned Powell. “No, inflation was high certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out. I’m glad to hear you say that the Biden administration seems to be intent on deflecting blame and recently this past Sunday spread the misinformation that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is the biggest single driver of inflation. I’m glad that you agree with me that’s not the truth.”Critics said the real problem with Biden’s gas prices and rising inflation are his own policies. A recent poll by I&I and Tipps showed 53 percent of Democrats believe Biden’s policies are to blame for inflation. Two-thirds of the poll’s respondents showed 66 percent believe too much federal spending has worsened inflation. Somehow despite it all, Biden refuses to take the blame.","FILE – President Joe Biden speaks at United Performance Metals in Hamilton, Ohio, May 6, 2022.

The Governor voiced that he is dedicated to providing Oklahomans relief amid skyrocketing gas prices, high taxes and runaway inflation.He insisted that Oklahomans need “relief right now,” not just a check for a tank of gas that will come in December.” This comes after Stitt called for a special session of the legislature back in May and demanded more solutions. He said Oklahoma is one of only 13 states taxing groceries and that he’s committed to changing this in his inflation relief package.“My inflation relief plan includes eliminating the state grocery tax and cutting personal income tax for every single Oklahoman,” he stated. “This will save the average Oklahoma family $453 each and every year.”The Governor was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, who also highlighted the Biden administration’s inability to provide real relief with it’s current budget plan. He reminded Oklahomans they should not have to wait for the Federal Government.“The only tax reform that’s currently in the budget is motor vehicle tax,” the governor uttered. “That’s not real relief. It only helps those who can afford a new car or  truck in the first place. Cutting the new car sales tax does nothing for families who are struggling to afford price for food, gas and everything in between.”If President Biden really wants to help lower energy costs for Americans, he should stop following the socialist Democrats’ energy playbook and start following Oklahoma’s.My response response to the president's proposal for a three-month federal gas tax holiday: pic.twitter.com/8wESy7MoOv— Governor Kevin Stitt (@GovStitt) June 22, 2022In addition to inflation relief, Stitt said he will always “back the blue” and ensure state law enforcement receives a pay increase.“Something I’m really excited about is pay increases four our law enforcement, he expressed. We will always back the blue in Oklahoma.”Stitt is now seeking re-election for his second term and his campaign got a major boost. He got backed with the backing of Trump. He called the incumbent Governor a “fearless defender” of the Second Amendment and “fighter for the incredible people of Oklahoma.”","FILE – Oklahoma Gov.

On Friday, Youngkin spoke to the Washington Post and said he’ll push an abortion ban after 15 weeks. He admitted the divided state legislature would likely pass a ban after 20 weeks. Youngkin asked four Virginia lawmakers who are all anti-abortion Republicans to craft legislation.“Virginians elected a pro-life governor and he supports finding consensus on legislation,” Youngkin spokesperson Macaulay Porter said in a statement. “He has tapped Senator Siobhan Dunnavant, Senator Steve Newman, Delegate Kathy Byron and Delegate Margaret Ransone to do so and prioritize protecting life when babies begin to feel pain in the womb, including a 15 week threshold.”My statement on Supreme Court’s Dobbs Ruling Announcement: pic.twitter.com/JA6N2UGDxi— Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) June 24, 2022Youngkin welcomed the high court’s ruling as an “appropriate” return of power to the states. Youngkin’s policy announcement is his most explicit policy statement to date. This was an issue that he tried to avoid during last year’s campaign. It only seemed to aggravate the partisan divide.“Virginians do want fewer abortions as opposed to more abortions,” Youngkin voiced. “I am not someone who is going to jump in and try to push us apart, there is a place we can come together.”In D.C. and Maryland Democratic leaders criticized the ruling and pledged to safeguard abortion access rights. Maryland Gov.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 1:15 PM PT – Saturday, June 25, 2022President Joe Biden signed the most sweeping gun control bill in decades. On Saturday, Biden said while the bill doesn’t have everything he wanted, it includes actions he’s long called for that are going to save lives.“Lives will be saved,” the President said. “Their message to us was to do something. Well today, we did.”The house passed a compromise made by a group of bipartisan Senators on Friday, which included enhanced background checks for buyers under 21 and provides federal funding for states to implement “Red Flag” laws. Biden signed the measure two days after the Supreme Court’s ruling struck down a New York law that restricted people’s ability to carry concealed weapons.I just signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. While this bill doesn't do everything I want it to, it does include actions that I've long called for that will save lives.Today, we acted for the families that have lost their souls to an epidemic of gun violence. pic.twitter.com/QWg3orWuS1— President Biden (@POTUS) June 25, 2022“From Columbine to Sandy Hook to Charleston, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland, El Paso, Atlanta, Buffalo, Uvalde,” Biden voiced. “For the shootings that happen every day in the streets that are mass shootings we don’t even hear about.”It also gets rid of the so called “boyfriend loophole,” prohibiting those convicted of domestic abuse from owing a firearm. Most of the $13 billion cost will help bolster mental health programs and aid schools, which have been targeted in Newtown, Connecticut, Parkland, Florida and elsewhere in mass shootings.Tune in as I sign into law S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and deliver remarks on reducing gun violence and saving lives. https://t.co/evfofKN84e— President Biden (@POTUS) June 25, 2022“I know there’s much more work to do,” he stated. “I’m never going to give up, but this is a monumental day.”The new law does not include tougher restrictions long championed by Democrats, such as a ban on assault style weapons and background checks for all gun transactions. However, it is the most impactful firearms violence measure produced by Congress since enactment of a long expired assault weapons ban in 1993.Biden went on to say he will host an event for lawmakers and families affected by gun violence on July 11.TOPICS:boyfriend loopholegun lawsJill BidenJoe Bidenmass shootingmental healthnewsnewtonOANOANNuvaldeWhite House SHARETWEETPINSHARE","President Joe Biden signs into law S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act gun safety bill, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Saturday, June 25, 2022.

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President Tanya Atkinson announced the decision to halt abortions at their clinics on Friday, following the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v.

Wade. pic.twitter.com/5NQRNrZz2C— Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin (@PPAWI) June 24, 2022The ruling devolves power back to the states, which re-establishes criminal penalties for abortion providers in Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, that means a statute passed in 1849 that created penalties with no exceptions made for cases of rape or incest.Last month, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin also said it planned to work with the organization’s Illinois chapter to arrange for abortion services in that state, where it is still legal up to the point of the fetus being considered viable.“Although abortion services are not available in Wisconsin for now, Planned Parenthood’s doors across the state are open and we are here to help patients get the care they need,” the PPH President voiced. “This includes helping patients access safe abortion care where it remains legal, offering travel assistance and providing appropriate follow-up care when they return home. Your health and the health of the community is our number one priority.”The Wisconsin Attorney General has vowed to not enforce penalties for administering abortions and has called on other law enforcement agencies to follow suit. 26 states are expected to restrict abortion access in response to the verdict.","Abortion rights supporters gather for a “pink out” protest organized by Planned Parenthood in the rotunda of the state Capitol Wednesday, June 22, 2022, in Madison, Wis.
