Updated 7:35 AM PT",Federal Govt. adding 87K IRS agents to payroll,"The population of Sioux City, Iowa is 85,617.Jordan-Hare Stadium, home of the Auburn Tigers, seats 87,451.Eighty-seven-thousand is the same number of IRS agents Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi just added to the federal government payroll.Ronald Reagan said the most fearful nine words in the English language are: “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.”We live in scary times.FBI agents raided President Trump’s home.Now, the IRS is adding 87,000 agents, claiming they’re needed to process claims.Right. They’re here to help.Big government exists to extract money from your pocket. If they run out of cash, they print more, regardless of out of control inflation.Why aren’t politicians hiring that many border patrol agents to stop illegal immigrants from coming to America? These additional IRS agents still surpass the 64,272 total employees in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.The fentanyl crisis plaguing every corner of our country is the direct result of drug dealers crossing illegally, killing Americans.Almost 92,000 people die from overdoses in America every year. Yet instead of hiring 87,000 Border Patrol agents to stop the flow of fentanyl at the border, they added that many IRS agents.If the Feds have no fear of raiding President Trump, don’t think for one second that you’re not next. I’ll let you know if I’m audited next year for writing this. At least they’ll have more bureaucrats to process my audit faster.TOPICS:IRSJoe BidenJordan-Hare StadiumNancy PelosiOANOANNRonald ReaganStefan Mychajliw SHARETWEETPINSHARE",(AP Photo),https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AP4979664632904703.jpg,,https://www.oann.com/federal-govt-adding-87k-irs-agents-to-payroll/

(Josh Galemore/Casper Star-Tribune/via Associated Press)OAN NewsroomUpdated 7:32 AM PT – Monday, August 15, 2022GOP Rep. Liz Cheney is facing tough competition against Harriet Hageman in Wyoming’s upcoming primary election. This comes as Cheney has deviated from representing Republican values multiple times during her current term. She has been at the forefront of congressional anti-Trump Republicans, notably voting with Democrats on gun control, the CHIPS Act and former President Trump’s second impeachment. In her campaign video, Cheney argues claims suggesting the 2020 election was rigged are lies.“It is a door Donald Trump opened to manipulate Americans to abandon their principles, to sacrifice their freedom, to justify violence, to ignore the rulings of our courts and the rule of law,” Cheney stated in a campagin ad. “This is Donald Trump’s legacy. “The Republican has continuously used her campaign to target Trump, despite the overwhelming amount of votes he received from Wyoming in the last two elections. The 45th President has pushed back, calling Cheney a RINO and claiming she “has gone crazy.” This came after he was also one of two House Republicans who voted for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) January 6 Committee.Next year, we'll elect a Congresswoman focused on Wyoming. Someone who fights our fights. Someone to actually REPRESENT us.

According to a recent court filing, the family is asking for $25 million in personal injury claims and $10 million for Guillen’s wrongful death.The lawsuit alleges the 20-year old suffered mental anguish, fear, emotional distress, physical injury and death as a result of sexual harassment and rape. A lawyer for the family said if the US Army denies their claim, they plan to file a federal lawsuit in California.“Let a jury decide if what happened to Vanessa was okay because that is where everything is going to happen, all the information is going to be heard, all the evidence is going to be displayed and everyone’s going to learn how the army and DOD protected itself rather than it’s soldiers,” stated Natalie Khawam, attorney for the Guillen family.BREAKING: the family of slain Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the U.S. government.

(Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)Daniel Baldwin, OAN White House CorrespondentUpdated 8:05 AM PT – Monday, August 15, 2022Former President Donald Trump alleged that the FBI took privileged “attorney-client” documents during its raid on Mar-a-Lago in a post on Truth Social.“Oh great! It has just been learned that the FBI, in its now famous raid of Mar-a-Lago, took boxes of privileged “attorney-client” material, and also “executive” privileged material, which they knowingly should not have taken,” Trump wrote. “By copy of this TRUTH, I respectfully request that these documents be immediately returned to the location from which they were taken. Thank you!”The claim was originally reported by Fox News. Attorney-client privilege is protected under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the right to counsel. The search warrant and property receipt for the August 8 raid of Mar-a-Lago were unsealed by Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart Friday. They revealed the warrant was approved on Friday, August 5 and the FBI had until August 19 to execute the warrant. The property receipt revealed the FBI took documents labeled “Executive Grant of Clemency re: Roger Stone,” “Info re: President of France,” “Various Classified/TS/SCI documents,” “Handwritten note,” “Binder of photos,” and other miscellaneous things. ","A crest of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is seen 03 August 2007 inside the J.

Susan Walsh/APOAN NewsroomUpdated 1:21 PM PT – Friday, August 12, 2022House Republicans on the Oversight Committee are urging the Justice Department to provide them with more information on the search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home. During a press conference Friday, Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), expressed concern over the events that led to the raid.“We are also very concerned about the disturbing reports that there was an informant, perhaps someone even undercover, at Mar-a-Lago or around former President Donald Trump and today we are also sending a letter to Director Wray demanding that he disclose to us the process by which that informant was utilized or that informant was placed,” Turner stated. “What is the relationship between the FBI and the person that has reportedly been utilized in this process?”House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) criticized the timing, while noting Trump is Joe Biden’s likeliest opponent in 2024 and it is less than 100 days before critical midterm elections.“House Republicans are committed to immediate oversight, accountability and a fulsome investigation to provide needed transparency and answers to the American people regarding Joe Biden and his administration’s weaponization of the Department of Justice and FBI against Joe Biden’s political opponent,” she stated.While they all condemned the attack on the Ohio FBI field office and the reported threats against federal agents, they highlighted the dwindling trust among Americans in these federal institutions.Turner said even when the documents around the raid are made public, questions will still be left unanswered. The lawmaker also explained as members of Congress, their role is to provide appropriate oversight as the American people deserve answers.“We have serious questions concerning the actions taken by Director Wray and ordered by Attorney General Garland…both of them are subject to oversight by Congress, and it is our job to ensure that they are not abusing their discretion…"" – @RepMikeTurner pic.twitter.com/sNfDg72xsb— House Republicans (@HouseGOP) August 12, 2022Turner then touched on the main reported reason for the search, inappropriately handled classified documents, and said the former president carries more classified information in his head than on paper. He added, the term “classified information” is often used as a blanket statement.“Many of them you can find on your own phone as we as we stand here,” he noted. “And if they fall within that category, they’re not an imminent national security threat that would rise to the level of you have to raid Donald Trump’s home and spend 9 hours there.”As Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) put it simply, it would be naïve to assume that the American people would not wonder, is this political?","Rep. Elise Stefanik, backed by, from left, fellow Reps.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) criticized his Democrat challenger Mike Franken over his support for open border policies. During a recent interview with Breitbart News, the Republican called Franken a radical who would be a rubber stamp for Joe Biden’s far-left agenda.His remarks came after Franken, earlier this year, said the border wall is “idiotic” and that illegal immigration is not a crime. Grassley said the wall works and Franken’s radical stances are extreme.“My opponent is not only extreme on saying the wall is idiotic, he also made a statement that he wants Iowa to be more progressive than California,” he stated. “Another statement that he’s made (is) that Biden is doing a fabulous job. I heard him say that during a debate. So, this guy is really far out.”Grassley hopes he has demonstrated over the years that he works hard for the American people. He added, if Republicans win back the majority, he’ll have seniority as Senate President pro tempore. That would be useful in helping resolve various issues including runaway inflation, high gas prices and the up-tick in crime in the country.","WASHINGTON, DC – OCTOBER 04: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol October 04, 2018 in Washington, DC.

The exercises involved the Chinese Navy and Air Force.Top officials in the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) claimed the U.S. delegation, led by Massachusetts Sen.

A few U.S. politicians connive with the separatist forces of Taiwan independence and attempt to challenge the one-China principle,” Webin stated. “This goes beyond their own abilities and is doomed to failure.”In the meantime, Sen.

The President stressed that the island is committed to maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, while pointing to current world events that some suggest could foreshadow Taiwan’s future.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year has highlighted the dangers that authoritarian states pose to the world order,” stated Ing-wen. “Not long ago, China conducted a long-term military exercise in the waters surrounding Taiwan, which also seriously disrupted regional stability and peace.”This visit comes nearly two weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) visited the country and as China continues to conduct military drills around the island. In the meantime, the US still maintains its One-China policy, recognizing the People’s Republic of China as the sole government of China.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks during a news conference, Friday, April 29, 2022, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

In a recent formal filing, Taiwan’s opposition party whip demanded a government disclosure about any of its potential business dealings with Paul Pelosi Jr. It also asks for the city of Taipei to explain whether Pelosi’s recent visit involved any business interests in Taiwan. This comes as Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party is coming under fire for jeopardizing the island’s sovereignty for partisan interests.“Tsai Ing-wen does seem to be gaining a lot in terms of notoriety as well as wide support from the so-called Western partners,” said Joanna Lei, Taiwanese politician and international relations expert. “However, people in Taiwan, especially those who are opposed to her policy or her administrative measures, have now been sacrificed. With Nancy Pelosi coming to Taiwan touting the achievements of the DPP government, it’s stamping on all the hopes and dreams of the people who are still fighting those injustice measures.” This comes after Fox News and the Daily Mail reported Paul Pelosi Jr. is invested in lithium business in Taiwan or in China after he accompanied the House Speaker on her contentious trip. Taiwanese politicians say if any of this is true then the island’s security was put at stake for Pelosi’s business interests.",Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen is pictured.

Thousands of American and Afghan allies were abandoned, billions of dollars of military equipment were left behind, and 13 U.S. service members tragically died.We cannot forget about this failure.— Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) August 15, 2022Americans are calling today a day of lamentation as they reflect on the day the Afghan government started to fall. On Sunday, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) gave his assessment on the botched withdrawal a year later. He stressed, there was a severe disconnect from what the Intelligence reports were saying that a Taliban takeover was imminent and would happen swiftly in comparison to what the White House and State Department was saying.McCaul said State Department and White House officials saw the conflict in a more rose colored lens and thought they had time to get all Americans and allies out of the country. This vision came despite not having enough resources for an effective evacuation plan.“There was no plan and there was no plan executed,” stated the Texas lawmaker. “Even beforehand, I think the State Department probably didn’t have the resources they needed to carry out an evacuation of this size and enormity. They had 36 consular officers trying to process hundreds-of-thousands of people. They were overwhelmed, but there were so many mistakes.”McCaul went on to stress the State Department promised those in Afghanistan working with the US would be able to escape the persecution of the Taliban. However, that has not happened and those allies are being hunted down and tortured.It has been one year since Joe Biden’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal.5 veterans sit down and share their thoughts in Not in Vain One Year Later. Stay tuned: pic.twitter.com/gB1eLhg0tl— GOP (@GOP) August 15, 2022Strategic analyst, General Jack Keane said the Taliban has now resurrected its severely draconian laws restricting women’s dress and behaviors as well as economic policies, in turn, running the country into the ground. The general stressed this would not have happened if President Joe Biden had listened to the experts, but he took a different path instead .“Still, it was an acceptable stalemate as far as many policymakers were concerned,” Keane explained. “The President thought he knew better and he was very defiant and he rejected all of their advice. Then he presented a false narrative to the American people, which I find very disturbing. He said my choice is get out now or have t out thousands of American troops back in here to fight the Taliban and take casualties doing that. We have not been in direct combat with the Taliban since 2014…that was a completely false narrative that he presented to the American people.”Meanwhile, other operators and Americans who served during the war in Afghanistan believe there were several problems leading to the withdrawal. Navy SEAL turned author Jack Carr has repeatedly said accountability was lacking during the fight, in turn, resulting in ineffective military officers to fail up. He also said in the final days of the withdrawal the military and State Department “rushed to their death,” which is something he said he learned not to do while in the SEALs.Retired Army General and former Director of the CIA, David Petraeus further lamented in a recent op-ed that America’s commitment to supporting the Afghan government was shaky throughout the conflict. Petraeus went on to say within years after the initial invasion in 2001, leaders shifted focus elsewhere to conflicts like in Iraq while taking resources away from the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. This allowed those terrorist groups to grow stronger. He also says even when the military was more aggressive in its tactics against terror groups, those efforts were short lived and didn’t have enough force to keep those groups at bay.“So there were alternatives,” Petraeus  noted. “It would not have removed all of our boots on the ground to be sure, but we would have kept bases in Afghanistan, which are important not just for Afghanistan but for the regional counterterrorism campaign. And it certainly would have avoided what I think is quite a devastating situation for Afghanistan and the Afghan people, whom we tried to help for 20 years and have literally left behind.”Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger suggested Afghanistan could be indicative of a larger problem among the US security establishment. He said top military leaders and diplomats are “responding to the emotion of the moment.” In his analysis, this seems to not only have led to the development of a stronger Taliban, but it is also leading America towards wars with Russia and China without knowing how they are going to end.One year ago today the U.S. Embassy in Kabul was evacuated and Afghanistan fell to the Taliban.  Joe Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan led to chaos and 13 service members dead.Today the White House will try and rewrite history.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUpdated 11:00 AM PT – Monday, August 15, 2022During an interview with Breitbart News on Saturday, Republican Senate candidate Kelly Tshibaka asserted that it’s time to unseat incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Alaskans cannot trust her.The Trump-endorsed candidate argued that Murkowski flip-flops by saying one thing in Alaska and then often does the exact opposite when she goes to Washington, D.C.“She ran ads just a couple months ago saying that she was a fierce defender of the Second Amendment while she was colluding with the Democrats and Joe Biden to vote for gun control and our gun rights,” said Tshibaka. “This is the thing that cost her (Murkowski) her NRA endorsement. So now she’s dropped in her rating with them and I have the NRA’s highest rating. We are very much pro Second Amendment and against those red flag laws she voted for.”The Republican added that pro-choice voters can’t trust their current senator either. Murkowski voted against efforts to codify Roe v. Wade, even though she claimed she supports abortion rights.“She was the one who introduced the bill for late term abortions, and she’s consistently voted to fund national abortion providers with tax payers’ money. This is the kind of thing she does all the time,” claimed Tshibaka. “This is why everyone across this state is saying that it’s time for change. We can’t trust her.”This comes a few days after Project Veritas exposed Murkowski by releasing footage of her campaign staffers saying the senator secretly supports Alaska Ballot Measure 2.BREAKING: Project Veritas Action Press Secretary RC Maxwell Questions Sen. @LisaMurkowski on Secret Support of #RankedChoiceVoting and Effort to Ensure Re-Election by Campaign Staffers Affiliated with Ballot Measure 2MURKOWSKI: “Nothing can guarantee an election.” pic.twitter.com/YCPJ1WdhxI— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) August 11, 2022To voters, the video was depicted as an initiative to change several of the state’s election policies, including to get “dark money” out of campaigns.Murkowski echoed that the measure required gathered signatures across the state, but sidestepped when being asked about staffers who said they were strategic when creating the measure to ensure her re-election.","ANCHORAGE, ALASKA – JULY 09: U.S. Senate candidate Kelly Tshibaka greets the crowd during a “Save America” rally at Alaska Airlines Center on July 09, 2022 in Anchorage, Alaska.
