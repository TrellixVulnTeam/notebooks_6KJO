2022-09-14,3:53 PM PT,Sen. Paul: GOP majority to reveal Fauci’s ties to Big Pharma,"Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) grilled National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony Fauci yet again over his questionable push for mass-vaccination.During a Senate hearing today on Wednesday, the Kentucky Senator pointed out that the government’s vaccine guidelines do not include data on previous infection which provided natural immunity. Paul stressed that the vaccine guidelines do not respect the science on natural immunity. The Senator added that he will shed light on efforts by government officials that have resulted in windfall revenues for vaccine manufacturers.Rand Paul to Fauci: ""You refuse to answer whether anybody on the vaccine committees gets royalties from the Pharma industry… When we get in charge, we're gonna change the rules and you will have to divulge where you get your royalties from. We are going to learn about it."" pic.twitter.com/4CKH9z6ibk— Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 14, 2022“We’ve demanded them through Freedom of Information Act and what have you said? We’re not going to tell you. But I tell you this, when we get in charge, we’re gonna change the rules and you will have to divulge where you get your royalties from (and) from what companies,” Paul said. “If anyone in the committee has a conflict of interest, we’re gonna learn about it. I promise you that.”Senator Paul stressed that Fauci has denied the ‘very fundamental premise of immunology’ and that previous infection provides immunity in an apparent boon to vaccine-makers and the Big Pharma.","Sen.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., speak with reporters after watching a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy live-streamed into the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, Wednesday, March 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 6:02 PM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022House Republicans held a press conference where they slammed the Democrats failing policies. GOP members claimed that those policies hurt the nation. At the press conference they also discussed the Democrats failed leadership and how it has resulted in making Americans ”less safe.”When speaking to reporters on Wednesday, New York Representative Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) slammed the uptick in violent crime that the Big Apple State has experienced under Democrat leadership. She asserted that the Democrats were aware of their political shortcomings but they double-down on failing policies.“The lawlessness and rampant violent crime continue in our communities due to Democrat’s soft on crime policies,” Stefanik said. “And the sad part is Democrats know the consequences of their radical policies and they continue to double-down.”Stefanik went on, adding that Americans should not be subject to policies which aid the rich and hurt the middle and lower classes.“The American people cannot afford another year of failed Democrat one-party rule in Washington,” she said. “It’s time for leadership, which listens to the concerns of every American, which House Republicans are doing every day.”The New York firebrand was followed by California Representative David Valadao (R-Calif.) who pointed to the Democrat’s recent shortcomings in the Golden State. Valadao said he spoke with working class families whose concerns have yet to be alleviated by the White House or California’s liberal leadership.“I spent the last month back home talking to a lot of different groups of people, and the biggest concern which kept coming up in all these conversations was just how expensive it is to live,” Valadao said.The California representative said the rising costs for fuel, groceries and just about everything else is the biggest issue facing his constituents. Valadao also said blue-collar companies want to invest in California but have been barred by liberal policies and a power grid which can’t even support the residents who live there now.“I hear from businesses across all different types of industries who want to invest in new technologies to create jobs in California, but they don’t have the required electricity needed to make these investments worth it,” Valadao mentioned. Valadao said that Joe Biden has refused to issue permits to companies to invest in the State. He also mentioned that the permits he has issued have been hindered by California Governor Gavin Newsom who shuts down the industry in order to protect the environment. The California Representative was followed by New York Representative Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.). She echoed criticisms highlighted by Representative Stefanik.Malliotakis reiterated that the biggest issue facing her constituents is violent crime. She claimed that the uptick in crime has been fueled by lax-prosecution under New York’s soft-on-crime leaders.“Everything from rape, robbery, felony, assault, burglary, grand theft auto, transit crimes, sex crimes, they’re all up,” Malliotakis said. “And people in my city do not feel safe. And there a number of policies which have led to this.” The Representative said that she has put forward numerous proposals aimed at curbing crime. This includes legislation which weigh’s offenders’ criminality. All of her proposals have been shot down by Democrats. Malliotakis then gave several examples of career criminals who have flaunted the city’s no-bail policies as they continue to repeat their crimes without discipline. She later spoke on the deadly impact the open-border has had on her people. There, she asserted that fentanyl was streaming from the border without hindrance.“In my district, fentanyl deaths are already up 13% this year, and we know that it’s coming from our southern border,” Malliotakis announced. “So, it’s a combination of the federal policies and the state policies under one-party Democrat rule which have proved a disaster. And its leading to my constituents and so many Americans across the nation being less safe.” The presser concluded with Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). He blasted the Biden administration’s fiscal policies which, according to him, have flushed the market down the drain.“President Biden and Nancy Pelosi continue to show how out of touch and tone deaf they are by throwing a party yesterday at the White House to celebrate inflation at the exact same time that the market’s crashing because of inflation that President Biden and Speaker Pelosi created,” Scalise said. Scalise said he expects Democrats to put forward legislation to address some of the pressing issues facing the nation, an expectation which he says has yet to be met. He then criticized the crisis at the border. The Republican asserted that the administration has repeatedly lied about the true situation in southern states which he said is ”out of control”.The Minority Whip said Republicans have tried to put forward legislation to address the problems, but have been shot down by democrats in office.“I wish we had bills on the floor to address those here, we’ve laid out to Speaker Pelosi what those bills are, that would lower gas prices, that would provide a stable energy supply, that would lower inflation or secure our border,” he said. “But they won’t bring any of those bills to the House floor because they want to continue doubling down on their inflation-ridden policies, raising taxes, raising spending to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.”","House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of La., left, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calif., and Rep.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 2:36 PM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has called Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-S.C.) Bill that would ban abortions after 15-weeks an ‘extreme’ piece of legislation.During a press briefing on Tuesday, Jean-Pierre claimed the South Carolina Senator’s Bill is “wildly out of step with what Americans believe.” The Biden White House official also accused Graham of placing no exemptions for health in his legislation. However, Graham’s Bill notably includes exceptions for rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk.Karine Jean-Pierre: ""I'm going to quote Lindsey Graham from August 7, 2022, and he said, 'I've been consistent. I think states should decide the issue of marriage and states should decide the issue of abortion.' That's from his own mouth and now he wants to do a national ban."" pic.twitter.com/V9W7nWXvVF— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 13, 2022Jean-Pierre also sought to cast the White House’s advocacy for abortion as progress.“Republicans in Congress are focused on taking right away for millions, millions of women across the country,” Jean-Pierre stated. “While we are fighting for progress, they are fighting to take us back. President Biden and congressional Democrats are committed to restoring the protections of Roe, and they are committed to doing so in the face of continued radical steps by elected Republicans to put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians instead of women and their doctors.” Jean-Pierre’s attempt to paint Republicans as regressive comes as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he is not on board with Graham’s Bill.","Sen.

(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 1:37 PM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022A storm of criticism hit Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after she boasted that Democrats would retain the majority after the midterms. On Wednesday, the House Speaker claimed that Democrats will pick up House seats and stave-off a red wave.“There are some among you who belittle my political instincts and the rest, I got us here to the majority twice and I don’t intend on giving it up,” Pelosi said.Polling and Joe Biden’s approval rating suggest that Democrats will likely lose the House in the fall. However, Pelosi is ignoring those bellwethers. She also refuses to say whether she’ll seek another term as Speaker.Pundits are pointing out that Pelosi had the same optimism for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:44 AM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022Damning information from a second Hunter Biden laptop may be circulating around on the web. New York Magazine contributing editor Andrew Rice appeared on CNN to discuss the latest “laptop from hell.” Rice penned an article on the laptop saga alongside Olivia Nuzzi, verifying at least one personal electronic device has fallen into someone else’s hands.The editor confirmed numerous aspects of Hunter’s life were extracted, including emails, texts, transactions and explicit content. Given the younger Biden’s history of reported substance abuse, Rice said its entirely likely the initial laptop was not the only sensitive data cache he misplaced.“People close to him have propagated the idea that perhaps actually there is a second laptop out there that might actually trace back too, which goes back to the general point that Hunter Biden was capable of losing more than one laptop that potentially contained devastating information about himself during this time period in his life,” continued the contributing editor.In fact, laptop whistleblower Jack Maxey claims an additional 450 gigabytes of additional data was recovered from a hard drive allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden. The drive also contained 80,000 previously unseen images that Maxey described as more disturbing than what was contained in the initial leak.Additionally, the U.K. Daily Mail has released a video of Hunter confessing that Russian drug dealers confiscated another one of his laptop during a Las Vegas bender.Some have claimed laptop repair man John Mac Isaac could not positively identify the first son due to the fact that he is legally blind. While Rice acknowledged Mac Isaac is visually impaired, his affliction does not completely obscure his sight. Furthermore, Rice asserts the FBI would not have seized the initial laptop from Mac Isaac if it was little more than right wing disinformation.“He has a subpoena that the FBI served on him and they came and took away this laptop. In passed into the hands of the FBI, presumably because it had some kind of relevance they thought to the ongoing federal criminal investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances that status of which we really don’t know much about.”Federal prosecutors are currently considering leveling charges against the first son for tax violations and providing a false statement to purchase a firearm. Meanwhile, this story has barely made waves outside of non-mainstream bubbles while Democrat-aligned actors have worked to call the authenticity of the original story into question.Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have also been probing into Hunter Biden’s usage of his father’s influence to secure foreign business deals.","FILE – In this Oct. 11, 2012, file photo, Hunter Biden waits for the start of the his father’s, Vice President Joe Biden’s, debate at Centre College in Danville, Ky.

During an interview on Tuesday with the National Press Club, Adams said he believes it is ‘imperative’ to give migrants legal access to employment.Today @PressClubDC @ericadamsfornyc in conversation with @JenJudson pic.twitter.com/7ME9YZSXMq— Bill McCarren (@mccarrennews) September 13, 2022This comes as the process for people seeking permission to work in the United States takes about six months after an individual files an asylum application. Adams said that the federal government is expecting migrants to wait in the country for months without working.“The strange this is, particularly in New York and across the country, there’s such a demand for a need of employees,” Adams said. “Many of my industries are dying to get employees. So, if you are a nurse from Venezuela, why am I having you sit down and be not using your medical profession to help in the hospitals that we are, that we have a shortage of nurses. If you are an engineer, we have a shortage of engineers. If you are a teacher, we have a shortage of teachers, bilingual teachers. So, that six-month delay is creating a bigger crisis.”Adams went on to state that while illegal immigrants should be vetted before entering the country, there should be a pathway for them to receive housing and education.","New York City Mayor Eric Adams attends a Michael Kors fashion show during Fashion Week, Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2022, in New York.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:33 AM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022Come you masters of war says the Biden administration amid the conflict in Ukraine. In a press conference Tuesday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said momentum is on the side of Ukraine as it battles Russian forces thanks to American weapons producers. He added, the Ukrainian troops are getting the hang of the billions-of-dollars of military aid funneled into the country’s armories.“And I would also add that many of the systems that we’ve been providing in just the last few weeks and couple of months have proven instrumental and effective in the Ukrainians ability to to go on the offense and to be actually quite effective on the defense in the last several days and weeks,” Kirby stated. “To include, of course, those advanced rocket systems that were that we’ve talked about so much. They’re using and they’re using them with great effect.”Kirby went on to echo typical Biden administration derisions of Russian President Vladimir Putin while claiming since the start of the war, he’s tried to obscure it. He also claimed the Russian people are beginning to question the tactics as well as spirit of the invasion and are putting pressure on Putin. Kirby pointed out, Russia’s recent air strikes have been missing their marks while Ukraine continues is counteroffensive.“It looks like they were largely going after the power grid,” he explained. “Mixed success, I think not all their strikes hit the targets or at least damaged the infrastructure to a maximum degree. But that was certainly what we would anticipate or what we analyzed as a response to what the Ukrainians were doing up in the north. It remains to be seen what their next steps are going to be here as the Ukrainians remain on the offensive up in the north and to continue to pursue a counteroffensive down in the south.”Meanwhile, Biden’s Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is warning of possible turmoil along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border as conflict brews in the region. In 2020, Russia brokered a peace deal between the two countries after a six-week war broke out over contested territory, killing more than 6,600 people.On Tuesday, however, fighting broke out on the Armenian side of the border with leaders from both sides pointing fingers at one another regarding who started the fight. Armenia says Azerbaijan launched a barrage of artillery to start the skirmish while Azerbaijan claims it was responding to a “large-scale provocation,” also adding Armenian troops set up mines and fired upon military personnel. According to reports, 99 troops were killed in the fighting.This prompted fears from the international community that another large scale war would break out and Russia would call back its peacekeeping personnel to add bodies to the forces fighting Ukraine.“Well, always, always concerns because whether Russia tries in some fashion to stir the pot to create a distraction from Ukraine is something that we’re always concerned about,” said Blinken. “But if Russia can actually use its own influence, for good which is to again, calm, calm the waters, end the violence and urge people to engage in good faith on building peace, that would be a positive thing.”However, reports from the Kremlin stress Putin is doing everything he can to de-escalate the conflict, echoing calls for peace with the international community. In the meantime, NSC spokesman Kirby and other members of Biden’s National Security apparatus vow to continue lines of communication with counterparts in Ukraine to take orders on the country’s military needs.","FILE – Pentagon spokesman John Kirby speaks during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington, Wednesday, March 9, 2022.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) speaks during a Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security hearing. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 8:59 AM PT – Wednesday, September 14, 2022Violent crime has continued to rise in Memphis, Tennessee. This comes as Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) recently slammed soft-on-crime policies hindering the nation.“We in Tennessee have just been heartbroken over what has happened in Memphis with criminals being back on the streets,” stated the Republican lawmaker.Her comments came after recent attacks in Memphis, where it was discovered the suspects in two recent attacks had been released from prison before serving their full sentences for prior convictions.Eliza Fletcher, 34, was allegedly abducted during her morning run on September 2 and her remains were later found behind an empty house. The suspect, 38-year-old ex-con Cleotha Abston, also known as Cleotha Henderson, served only 20 years of a 24-year prison sentence for an armed kidnapping. He was released in 2020. Henderson has also been indicted on rape, kidnapping and felony firearms charges after allegedly sexually assaulting a victim in 2021.Additionally, the recent shooting in Memphis that killed four and injured three others is being tied to 19-year-old Ezekiel Kelly, which came after Kelly was previously charged with criminal attempted first degree murder. Kelly reportedly pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault in 2021, but walked free early only serving 11-months of his three-year prison sentence.Meanwhile, Tennessee state Rep. Cameron Sexton (R-Tenn.) recently said the Truth in Sentencing law could have kept Henderson and Kelly behind bars had it been enacted earlier than July 1 of this year. The law says if an individual is convicted of murder, they must serve their full sentence. If convicted of lesser crimes like aggravated assault, however, they only need to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.“If this law would have been in place back in 2000 or just a little bit ago for the other case, the Kelly case, those individuals would still be behind bars,” Sexton stated. “They wouldn’t have been out, they wouldn’t have had these victims, these individuals would not have been killed.”A recent survey by the Major Cities Chiefs Association found overall violent crime spiked 4.2 percent from January to June this year. However, in the case of Ezekiel Kelly, Democrat Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland is placing the blame on the judicial system.“The problem is not the Memphis Police Department, cause they’re arresting people,” said Strickland. “The problem is this judicial system that will not punish. That is our problem.”Political analysts say violent crime could be a driving force for voter turnout in the upcoming midterm elections.","Ranking Member Sen.

(Photo by Adem ALTAN / AFP) (Photo by ADEM ALTAN/AFP via Getty Images)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 11:58 AM PT – Thursday, September 15, 2022Democrats have reiterated that they’re not willing to negotiate their stance on abortion. On Wednesday, Democrat lawmakers came after Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-S.C.) proposed federal abortion law.The proposed Bill is an attempt to bridge a political divide on the subject by allowing abortions up to 15-weeks past the point of conception nationwide. The Bill allows exceptions to the time limit for cases of rape, incest and pregnancies that put the mother’s life in jeopardy.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused Graham of trying to outlaw the procedure while she was speaking out against the idea of each state deciding their own policy on the matter.“Senator Graham saying that this should be a states issue – boom, boom, boom, boom,” Pelosi said. “Everybody’s saying this should be a states issue. And then, probably at the insistence of the MAGA grassroots coming out and saying there should be a federal ban.”In a separate press conference, a trio of Democrat representatives characterized Graham’s suggestion as ‘government mandated pregnancies.’ Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said any negotiation on policy is off the table. He also claimed that Democrats only position is to enforce federal abortion enabling.“We support Roe v. Wade,” he said. “We support the Women’s Health Protections Act. Read the Bill. Republicans, if you’re unclear on our position, we all voted for it. That’s our position. But their position is a nationwide ban.”Jeffries was caught flat footed when a reporter pointed out that the Graham’s proposal does not ban abortions. The reporter noted that it simply aligns America’s abortion policy more closely to many European nations. The Democrat responded by spouting his unwavering support for the now-defunct Roe v. Wade court case.After being called out for “misleading” rhetoric, Democrat Caucus Chair Rep. Hakeem Jeffries repeatedly refuses to recognize ANY abortion limits, including until the moment of birth. pic.twitter.com/M7LfCNr89A— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) September 14, 2022While speaking on the floor of the upper chamber, Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) claimed that any restrictions on unmitigated abortion should galvanize a response.“This is an outright attack on women in this country. That is how I see it. That is how more and more women and those who support our right to make decisions about our own bodies,” Hirono said. “Madam President, I yield the floor, but clearly this is a literally a call to arms.”Abortion activists agree with Hirono’s sentiments. Dozens of pro-life groups and crisis pregnancy centers have been attacked since the leaked Supreme Court’s draft decision on Roe v. Wade.","US Senator Lindsey Graham holds a media conference at JW Marriott Hotel in Ankara, on January 19, 2019.

(Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun Sentinel via AP, Pool)OAN NewsroomUPDATED 9:37 AM PT – Thursday, September 15, 2022Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer was stunned after the defense team for the Parkland shooter unexpectedly rested its case. Lawyers for Nikolas Cruz made the surprise move Wednesday. Their move caught the judge off guard and left the prosecution unprepared for its turn to present a rebuttal.This comes after lead Defense Attorney Melissa McNeill initially said her team would call a total of 80-witnesses but stopped at just 26. The sudden twist prompted frustration from the judge.“I just want to say this is the most uncalled for, unprofessional way to try a case. You. You all knew about this,” Judge Scherer said. “And even if you didn’t make your decision till this morning to have 22 people plus all of this staff and every attorney march into court, be waiting as if it’s some kind of game. Now I have to send them home, the State’s not ready. They’re not going to have a witness ready. We have another day wasted. I just I honestly, I have never experienced a level of unprofessionalism in my career! It’s unbelievable!”The jury is considering the punishment that the 23-year-old should face in connection with the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The shooting left 17 people dead and 17 others injured.Cruz’s defense team is seeking to raise questions about his mental health. They hope to convince jurors to decide life in prison instead of choosing the death penalty. However, after resting its case without warning, the judge suggested the defense was “playing chess.”""I have never experienced a level of unprofessionalism in my career. It's unbelievable.""— Judge Elizabeth Scherer rips into the Parkland shooter's defense after it unexpectedly rest its case, leading to a heated exchange pic.twitter.com/SQ8lceOh1F— The Recount (@therecount) September 14, 2022“You can put make your record later. But you’ve been insulting me the entire trial so, blatantly, taking your headphones off, arguing with me, storming out, coming late intentionally if you don’t like my rulings. So quite frankly, this has been long overdue,” she said. “So please be seated.”A unanimous vote by the jury is required to sentence Cruz to death, otherwise he will be sentenced to life in prison. The trial will continue on September 27 with the prosecution’s rebuttal. It will be followed by closing arguments. Those remarks are expected to occur the week of October 10.","Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz is shown at the defense table after the defense team announced their intention to rest their case during the penalty phase of Cruz’s trial at the Broward County Courthouse in Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2022.

Parent Union drew attention to the presentation. The Union alleged that ‘food choice’ is the result of a false standard of health. Nutritionist, Kera Nyemb-Diop, and influencer Blair Imani, are featured in the video. The two ladies encouraged students to eat whatever they want as no nutritional choice is healthier than another.“Diet culture, fatphobia and systems of oppression have created false hierarchies of food, it shows up everywhere,” Nyemb-Diop said.“For instance, harmful thought patterns (include) like earning food though exercising or  that dessert is the reward for the “punishment” of eating vegetables,” Imani said. “Remember that you do not need to earn food.”The video’s content directly opposes the CDC’s dietary suggestions. The CDC encourages eating vegetables and limiting intake of processed sugars.This comes amid the fact that one out of every five children in the United States is obese.","CHICAGO – APRIL 20: A student eats lunch at Jones College Prep High School April 20, 2004 in Chicago, Illinois.

An expert on Chinese surveillance and social media claimed that TikTok is a disaster waiting to happen.Geoffrey Cain testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday. There, he claimed that TikTok’s software contains powerful surveillance and data collection capabilities. He also noted that the app is owned by a company that must comply with the dictates of the Chinese Communist Party.TikTok cannot be trusted. Chinese law requires its parent company ByteDance to partake in intelligence operations if it's requested. pic.twitter.com/EHMSeFy2P0— Geoffrey Cain (@geoffrey_cain) September 14, 2022“TikTok executives will, under Chinese law, face a minimum of 20 days detention if they refuse to turn over data on anyone in the world,” Cain said. “And this could be anybody, anybody in China, anybody who’s traveling through China, through Hong Kong. This is a documented legal situation, and it’s not something that TikTok, despite claiming to be an American company, can avoid.”Cain said TikTok uses a shell corporation in the Cayman Islands to throw up a red herring in order to distract from these obligations to the CCP. The American branch of TikTok, and its Chinese developer parent company ByteDance, both report to the same shell company in the Cayman Islands. The two branches are also both run by the same CEO. Cain said the Chinese government has made its ambitions clear and that data is its biggest target.“An authoritarian regime such as China will attempt to get access to that data and use it to build artificial intelligence capabilities, capabilities that might involve espionage, spying on military officials, government officials,” Cain announced. “This is a major, major Trojan horse that needs to be dealt with. Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) pointed out that TikTok is becoming increasingly more aggressive in its pursuit of your data.“One of the things that I’ve seen from TikTok even recently is the ability to be able to keep up with keystrokes,” he said. “If you use their app to be able to then go to other websites that they can then track your keystrokes. That would include credit card numbers, that would include passwords, user IDs, all of those things as well.”Data that the CCP may be harvesting from TikTok users plays right into the hands of China’s digital ambitions which poses a major National Security threat.",Chesnot/Getty Images,https://d2pd5v545ww278.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/4deb96f0-ef78-11e9-b9bc-85aa578317a3.webp, Trump says FBI and DOJ are targeting and harassing ‘dozens of amazing patriots who stand for America’TOPICS:appsByteDanceCCPNational SecuritynewsOANOANNpoliticstiktok. social media SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/expert-testimony-tiktok-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen/
