11:15 AM PT",Ohio takes step toward hardening security at schools,"Schools in Ohio may be a bit safer in the near future as the state legislature passes a bill allowing school employees to arm themselves with 24 hours of intense training.The Ohio Senate passed House Bill 99 on Wednesday. Critics argued the bill sends the wrong message to children in the wake of the tragic school shooting in Texas. Proponents said it would give schools an option to protect America’s children.“Last week I called on the General Assembly to pass a bill that would allow local school districts to designate armed staff for school security and safety,” said Ohio Governor Mike Dewine (R). “My office worked with the General Assembly to remove hundreds of hours of curriculum irrelevant to school safety to ensure training requirements were specific to a school environment and contained significant scenario-based training. House Bill 99 accomplishes these goals and I thank the General Assembly for passing this bill to protect Ohio children and teachers. I look forward to signing this important legislation.”Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle made their cases in support or opposition to the bill. Many Republicans said now more than ever it is time to act.“Our teachers didn’t sign up for this job to be sharpshooters,” voiced Michelle Mueller, a member of a gun safety group called Moms Demand Action. “They will tell you in their own voice. They are there to educate our children.”Others pointed to the fact that after major tragedies or threats, security has been boosted where those events took place but not in schools. The training would include how to stop an active shooter, how to de-escalate a violent situation, trauma and first-aid care, at least four hours in scenario-based or simulated training exercises and a completion of tactical live firearms training.“More guns in schools only increases the access that students have to guns,” high school student Katherine Hiland stated. “I would know best, I’m a teenager. We get up to a lot of trouble even when we don’t mean to.”https://twitter.com/GovMikeDeWine/status/1532738887344279552Slight changes made in the senate mean the bill will now head back to the House for a final vote. It will then be sent to Dewine’s desk to be signed. If signed, each school district will be able to decide if their staff can carry firearms and schools will be able to require more training if they find it necessary.","Ohio Gov.

On Thursday, the Democrat-led House panel met for an emergency session to discuss a package of measures called the Protecting Our Kids Act.Despite Republican lawmakers concerns that Democrats are politicizing mass shootings, committee chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) emphasized lawmakers must act swiftly.“You say it’s too soon to take action, that we are politicizing these tragedies to enact new policies,” he stated. “It has been 23 years since Columbine, 15 years since Virginia Tech, 10 years since Sandy Hook, seven years since Charleston, four years since Parkland and Santa Fe and the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. It has been three years since El Paso. It has been a week since we learned again that gun violence can reach any of our children and grandchildren at anytime.”Republicans on the panel argued it’s too soon. Specifically, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) emphasized protecting children is not a Republican or Democrat issue.Life is precious. pic.twitter.com/MARxT2oRKt— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) June 2, 2022Meanwhile, GOP congressman Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) called consideration of gun control legislation at this time “irresponsible.” He also said Democrats “have no idea” if the bill they are pushing would actually be effective.“It is reflexive and it is irresponsible to consider bills while we’re still trying to figure out what happened in some of these circumstances that you suggest animated the need for this hearing,” said the Florida Republican. “The chairman referenced Uvalde in the first moments of this hearing, but yet we’re still deciphering key elements of the law enforcement response of the physical plant of points of intrusion.”.@RepMattGaetz is spot on. “Democrats want to ensure that the government has the power to take your guns away without giving you due process.” pic.twitter.com/bAEZBG42DI— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) June 2, 2022The legislation would raise the aged for buying a semi-automatic rifle from 18 to 21-years-old and allow states to crack down on gun trafficking. It would also ban high-capacity ammunition magazines and the sale of ghost gun kits as well as require a firearms safe storage.In the meantime, as the debate in the House continues, the legislation faces a tougher path in the Senate as the bill will need at least 10 Republican votes in the upper chamber to move forward.","From left, Rep.

According to the agency, nine patients were taken to local hospitals after experiencing signs of overdoses over a span of around 36-hours last week. Additionally, El Paso police reported two people died from an accidental overdose last month.Carlos Briano, a spokesperson for the El Paso DEA, said an opioid epidemic is taking place in the community. He stressed using any substance not prescribed by medical professionals can be very dangerous.“The only substance that is safe to consume is one that is prescribed to you by a doctor or by a dentist and that you obtained from a licensed pharmacy,” Briano stated. “Anything else, you are playing with your life.”The spokesperson also pointed out that in 2021 the agency seized more fentanyl than the previous five years combined as cartels have continued to smuggle the deadly substance into the US.“Cartels are making fentanyl to appear to be a legitimate medication, in a side-by-side comparison they are almost indistinguishable,” he explained. “The way we can tell is through a laboratory analysis.”Briano said the agency’s ultimate goal is to disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations and warn the public of the dangers. The El Paso County Medical Examiner reported 64 overdose deaths involving fentanyl in 2021, which is a 45 percent increase from the previous year. As authorities in the region deal with the impact of the deadly substance, Colorado is also seeing a high amount of fentanyl flood the the state’s borders.On Wednesday, authorities in Colorado announced they have already seized more fentanyl this year so far than in all of 2021. The state patrol said they have seized over 2 million dosage units of the synthetic opioid across Colorado’s communities in 2022. This is approximately 400,000 more than 2021. Fentanyl overdoses have also risen in the state, swelling to 540 in 2020 and then doubling to 905 in 2021.Authorities have said their efforts seemed like a “drop in the bucket” compared to the criminal enterprises manufacturing and distributing the illicit drug.“It is now June 1 and we’ve seen about 225 pounds of fentanyl,” said Col. Matthew Packard of the Colorado State Patrol. “We talk about how deadly it is and we’re talking about the top of a pin, 225 pounds year to date that Colorado state troopers have taken out of cars being smuggled into Colorado. I think it’s collaborative law enforcement efforts, it’s harm reduction, it’s community engagement and it’s caring about your neighbor. It’s all of those things, the only way we’re going to be successful about this.” According to the CDC, more than 71,000 Americans died from fentanyl overdoses last year, which is an increase of around 14,000 from 2020.","Tablets believed to be laced with fentanyl are displayed at the Drug Enforcement Administration Northeast Regional Laboratory on October 8, 2019 in New York.  (Photo by DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images)",https://dzm0ugdauank9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/TABLETS.jpg, Biden’s USDA Pushes Transgender Agenda Or No School LunchesTOPICS:Carlos BrianocartelsCDCcrimeDEADrug Enforcement Administrationdrug overdosesDRUGSEl PasoFentanylHealthnewsOANOANNOpioid EpidemicpoliticsTexas SHARETWEETPINSHARE,https://www.oann.com/texas-colo-authorities-warn-of-spike-in-fentanyl-overdoses/

Ron DeSantis speaks at Miami’s Freedom Tower, on Monday, May 9, 2022. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier, File)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 7:54 AM PT – Friday, June 3, 2022Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) had a message for fathers as fatherhood awareness month kicked off. He declared society is in dire need of present, engaged and loving fathers.During an exclusive interview with the podcast “Solving the Fatherless Crisis,” DeSantis said the key to solving social problems in America starts at home. According to DeSantis, more than 18 million children do not have a father figure.“If every kid in America had a loving father in the home, we would have far fewer things we would have to deal with as a society,” said DeSantis. Governor DeSantis signs legislation that will provide more than $70 million to support fatherhood. https://t.co/uXDPga790v— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) April 11, 2022The governor has three children with his wife Casey. He claimed that building a family changed his perspective on life and opened his eyes to challenges parents face.“I think meeting my wife really changed my life, based off where I was going,” he stated. “Having the first child is really another one of those life altering experiences. It changes your perspective on life. Your living now to be able to raise these kids right. What I’m doing is trying to make sure we leave them a better world, a better state, a better country.”At a press conference last April, DeSantis signed groundbreaking legislation, which allocated $70 million to support involved fatherhood in Florida.“If you look over the last many decades, one of the worst social trends has been the decline of fatherhood,” the governor voiced. “We have a fatherhood crisis in this country. The fact of the matter is when you take kids that do not have a father present during their upbringing, the chances of them dropping out of school, getting involved with trouble with the law and having other issues increases dramatically.”According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, a loving and nurturing father improves outcomes for children, families and communities. Additionally, studies suggest that children with present fathers are significantly more likely to do well in school, have healthy self-esteem, show empathy and avoid criminal activity.","FILE – Florida Gov.

Investor Stephen Schork said rising prices on natural gas are driving fuel and heating prices, while also contributing to rising food prices. He believes “the war on natural gas is a war on the American consumer.”“So the inflation has not peaked…and this is the problem, runaway inflation at the gas pump and the grocery counter has been the lead indicator for recession of the last six recessions in the United States,” Schork explained.As a result, US consumers are facing shrinking incomes and worse quality of life. The US economy shrank nearly 1.5 percent in the first quarter, which has added to the fears of a broader economic downturn this year.","FILE – In this May 13, 2020, file photo, Tesla cars are loaded onto carriers at the Tesla electric car plant in Fremont, Calif.  the Golden State wants electric vehicle sales to triple in the next four years to 35 percent of all new car purchases.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)OAN NEWSROOMUPDATED 12:43 PM PT – Thursday, June 2, 2022President Joe Biden addressed the ongoing baby formula shortage as parents nationwide are struggling to feed their infants. While speaking to reporters at the White House Wednesday, he detailed his efforts to help get more formula onto store shelves.“We can’t let up in the infant formula market until its back to normal,” said Biden. “It’s going to take a couple more months, but we’re making significant process.”The shortage came after the Abbot baby formula plant in Michigan was shutdown. The shutdown, which took place in February, was due to two infant deaths linked to unsanitary conditions and practices at the facility.“We launched Operation Fly Formula, a major effort to airlift infant formula that meets Americans health standards and safety standards,” he stated. “Today, I’m proud to say that because of this flight, high quality formula is already on the way to American shelves. We’ve already conducted two flights with 1.5 million eight ounce bottles of Nestlé and Gerber’s hypo allergenic formulas for children with severe allergies.”  Biden also claimed he was not informed of the severe nature of the shortage until early April.“Here’s the deal, I became aware of this problem sometime in early April,” the president voiced. “We did everything in our power from that point on and that’s all I can tell you right now.”Despite his remarks, critics point out that he didn’t address the crisis until May. The president met with baby formula manufacturers for a virtual meeting Wednesday. During the meeting they told him they warned the FDA and his administration of upcoming shortages earlier this year.His push to alleviate the crisis comes as the White House recently announced United Airlines will now ship 3.7 million eight ounce bottles of the Kendamil infant formula from the UK. This will be Operation Fly Formula’s third mission.I’ve got an update on our efforts to bring more infant formula to the United States: We secured another 6.5 million bottles of safe infant formula from Nestlé. That means as of today, 94.5 million bottles of safe infant formula are heading to U.S. shelves. pic.twitter.com/1s4A5CphpB— President Biden (@POTUS) June 2, 2022The process will take three weeks to complete.","President Joe Biden listens as he meets virtually with infant formula manufacturers from the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington, Wednesday, June 1, 2022.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm (D) claimed high gas prices will justify a transition into supposedly clean energy. On Thursday, Granholm spoke at the Hillsborough River dam in Tampa to promote hydroelectric energy. During her speech, the former Michigan Governor laid out the Biden administration’s plan to replace fossil fuel.“We’re going to get to this clean energy economy,” Granholm declared. “One hydroelectric project, one solar panel, one wind turbine, one geo thermal project, one advanced nuclear reactor, one electric vehicle, one battery at a time.”However, the US relies on fossil fuels for more than 80 percent of its energy consumption. Granholm acknowledged that Americans are paying exorbitant gas prices and are unlikely to see much relief by the end of the year.“The Department of Energy has a energy information administration,” the secretary voiced. “Which is an objective entity that does analysis projecting the prices of gasoline. They said that things might stabilize by the end of this year, but the price of gas is likely to remain above four dollars a gallon.”Americans saw a 53 percent increase in gas prices over Memorial Day weekend compared to last year. The national average for a gallon of gasoline surpassed $4.60 that week, with motorists in downtown Los Angeles seeing pump prices of more than $8 per gallon. Rather than increasing fuel supply, the White House has stifled domestic oil drilling and production.⛽️ Gas prices reached another record high today$4.76 The Biden gas hike is not slowing down.— Nathan Brand (@NathanBrandWA) June 3, 2022Joe Biden used an executive order to effectively cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline on his first day in office. More recently, he cancelled the sales of drilling leases in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. Secretary Granholm believes the price Americans are paying today will pay off in the form of a so-called green energy future.“Ultimately, this price hike that we are seeing globally will likely remain high,” she said. “We want to make sure that at the same time that we are calling upon an increase in supply, that we are also accelerating our future to clean energy solution.”Biden expressed less apprehension towards foreign oil.

The letter came after officials released a record setting amount of oil from the reserve, in hopes to bring down record high gas prices.On Thursday, Repbulican’s accused the White House of draining the nation’s strategic reserves as a “stopgap measure” that did little to combat high gasoline prices.“The American people deserve to know more about DOE’s plan to backfill the SPR,”  said the letter signed by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee. “The SPR is intended for emergency supply chain disruptions, not as a stopgap to make up for the Biden administration’s war on domestic energy.” President Biden has tapped the nation’s strategic oil reserves, yet fuel costs continue to rise causing more pain at the pump for drivers across the nation.","FILE— High gas prices are shown in Los Angeles, Tuesday, May 24, 2022.
