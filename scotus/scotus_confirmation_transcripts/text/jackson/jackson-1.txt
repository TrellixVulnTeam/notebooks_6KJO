Today the committee will begin its consideration the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the 116th justice of the United States Supreme Court. Welcome, Judge Jackson, and congratulations to you and your family. KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: Thank you, senator. DICK DURBIN: This is a momentous occasion and you have much to be proud of. I know you have many family members and friends who want to -- you want to introduce, and we all look forward to hearing those introductions when you make your opening statement later.   At the outset, I want to note that I was sorry to hear that Justice Clarence Thomas was hospitalized yesterday. I'm sure I speak for all the members of the committee in wishing him a speedy recovery.   Before I turn to my own opening statement, I want to briefly discuss today's order of events and the ground rules for the hearing. Today each member of the committee has 10 minutes to make an opening statement. We'll go in seniority order, switching between Democratic and Republican senators.   After all members have made their opening statements, we'll hear from Judge Thomas Griffith and Professor Lisa Fairfax, who are here today to introduce Judge Jackson. Each introducer will have five minutes to make an opening statement. Finally, we will administer the oath to Judge Jackson and she will make her opening statement. And that will conclude today's events, and tomorrow we'll begin rounds of questions.   For those sitting in the audience, welcome. We are glad you could be here to witness this historic occasion. I ask all of our guests to be respectful and quiet during the hearing. Please do not stand up unless you're entering or exiting the room. And if you stand up, you will be asked by one of our distinguished members of the Capitol Police to sit down. If you refuse, you'll be escorted out of the room.   Let me be clear. We will not tolerate any disruptions from the audience. Any disruption will result in immediate removal. I also ask that our audience be respectful of the members of the Capitol Police who are here today to ensure everyone's safety. With that, we'll proceed to opening statements.   Judge Jackson, as I said, thank you again for being here today with your family and friends. The Supreme Court has a long and storied history. Its ranks have been filled by many superb justices whose contributions to the rule of law have stood the test of time. But the reality, the reality is that the court's members, in one respect, have never really reflected the nation they served.  When the Supreme Court met for the very first time in February of 1790 in the Exchange Building in New York, there were nearly 700,000 slaves without the right of citizenship in this new nation of nearly four million people. Neither African-Americans nor women had the right to vote. There was no equal justice under the law for a majority of people living in America.   In its more than 230 years, the Supreme Court has had 115 justices. 108 have been white men. [*]DICK DURBIN: Just two just -- justices have been men of color. Only five women have served on the court, and just one woman of color. Not a single Justice has been a black woman. You, Judge Jackson, can be the first. It's not easy being first. Often you have to be the best, in some ways the bravest. Many are not prepared to face that kind of heat, that kind of scrutiny, that ordeal in the glare of the national spotlight. But your presence here today, your willingness to brave this process will give inspiration to millions of Americans who see themselves in you. As I mentioned to you, I was at the steps of the Supreme Court this morning to see the rally in support of you. There were so many young African-American women and law students there seeing your pursuit as part of their dream. In other important ways, though, you're no different than many nominees who've come before us. President Biden nominated you because he knew your qualifications are outstanding. This committee knows you. You've appeared three previous times and each time you've been confirmed with bipartisan support, and your professional record and life experience. tell us what kind of lawyer, what kind of judge, and what kind of person you really are. The guiding principles can be found in your life and in your work that the Constitution must work for all Americans, not just the wealthy and powerful, that judges must show no favoritism, and that the judiciary must live up to the words emblazoned above the entrance, equal justice under law. So today's proud day for America; we've come a long way since 1790 and we know that we still have a long way to go to form a more perfect union. It's a moment that brings to mind something that the late Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, my friend said, to Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg at her nomination hearing. He said you face  --  you face a much harsher judge than this committee. And that is the judgment of history. And that judgment is likely to revolve around the question, did she restrict freedom or did she expand it? I return to the statement time and again because it asks a vital question, how will history judge us? Judge Jackson, I have no doubt that history will remember you as a justice who never stopped working to defend the Constitution. But I also ask the members of this committee as we begin this landmark confirmation process to consider how history will judge each Senator as we face our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent. This moment  --  moment also brings to mind something President Barack Obama, another trailblazer, said of a fellow Illinoian when the late Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement. President Obama said, while we cannot replace Justice Stevens' experience or wisdom, I will seek someone with similar  --  similar qualities, an independent mind, a record of excellence and integrity, a fierce dedication to the rule of law, and a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of America. Much like Justice Stevens, we cannot replace Justice Breyer, but with you Judge Jackson, we have a nominee who embodies the same qualities as both of these outstanding justices. You're independent minded and understand the critical importance of judicial independence. Your record is one of excellence and integrity from the championship debate team at Miami Palmetto Senior High School to Harvard and Harvard Law School, to your three judicial clerkships, your work as a federal public defender, a lawyer in private practice, a member of the Sentencing Commission, a federal district judge, and circuit court judge. Throughout your career, you've been a champion for the rule of law, determined to get it right even at the risk of public criticism. As a member of the United States, Sentencing Commission, a bipartisan group which reflected the spectrum of American thinking on law enforcement, you set out to make policy that truly represented Congressional intent when it came to making federal criminal sentencing fairer, and you did it by finding bipartisan common ground. During your tenure on that commission, 95% of the commission's votes were either unanimous or consensus. For example, the Commission implemented the Fair Sentencing Act, a law that I negotiated with then Senator Jeff Sessions that reduced the infamous 100 to 1 crack powder sentencing disparity. And you joined every one of your colleagues to make that change to the sentencing guidelines retroactive. You gave a powerful speech and I'm going to quote it, you said, there is no excuse for insisting that those who are serving exert  --  excessive sentences under the long disputed and now discredited prior guideline must carry on as though none of this has happened. The vote in favor of retroactivity was unanimous on the commission. Republicans and Democrats shared your view. And you've gone to great lengths to explain how the law affects real people. Indeed, with your nomination, we can be confident that the Court, its role, and its decisions will be more understandable to the American public. In your time on the bench, you've taken the time to explain your decisions and the consequences. When you were before this committee just last year for your DC Circuit hearing, you described how you quote "take extra care to communicate with parties". You added and I quote, "I speak to them directly and not just to their lawyers, I use their names. I explain every stage of the proceeding because I want them to know what's going on". As a result of that approach, you've made the law more approachable to litigants and American people, The cameras and the lights here today can make it easy to forget that at its core, the responsibility you seek is one of service. And I'm fully confident you'll serve Americans from all walks of life, all backgrounds, fairly and faithfully. Now there may be some who claim without a shred of evidence that you'll be a rubber stamp for this President. For these would be critics, I have four words: look at the record. Your complete record has been scoured by this committee on four different occasions. All of your nearly 600 written opinions, read and reread, 12,000 pages of transcripts, meeting minutes, and other materials for the Sentencing Commission, your sworn testimony before the committee less than a year ago, every published and reported word, you've written or spoken, your detailed answers to lengthy questions. For those who say they need more, I would answer that you sat down personally with every member on this dias [Ph]  --  of the committee, Democrats and Republicans. A fair review of all of this makes clear your values and your guiding principles. You have ruled for and against Presidents and administrations of both parties, you've ruled for prosecutors and for defendants, you've ruled for workers and for their employers, and you've been faithful to the law, not to any person or political cause. Now there may be others who allege that you're before us today as a product of the campaign of dark money groups. Once again, your record and the process that led to this nomination, belie that claim. To suggest that you're here merely because an organization supports you ignores your qualifications and the broad range of support you bring to this. In selecting you as his nominee, President Biden undertook a transparent selection process. He sought the input of Senators from both parties. Senator Grassley and I met in the Oval Room with the President. He invited us to proffer any nominees that we care to do. At the end of the day, the President alone chose you. He's put his faith in you to deliver justice to the highest level of the court. I share that faith. In announcing your nomination, the President spoke to many reasons that you deserve to sit on the high court. He noted the perspective you'll bring as a former member of the Sentencing Commission, as the first justice since Thurgood Marshall with considerable criminal defense experience, and as the only  --  the second current justice, only the second, to serve as a federal trial court judge. He also noted your upbringing and the fact that you come from a law enforcement family. Yet despite that shared family experience and despite your record, we've heard claims that you were quote "soft on crime". These baseless charges are unfair. A conservative National Review columnist called claims brought by one of my colleagues, quote "meritless to the point of demagoguery". They fly in the face of pledges my colleagues made that they would approach your nomination with civility and respect, and fact checkers, including The Washington Post, ABC News, and CNN have exposed some of these charges as falsehoods. Critics have even stooped to accusing you of sharing the views of the clients you represented, even though they know that your work as an attorney was in service to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution's promise of effective assistance of counsel. Would law enforcement officials and organizations, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, and the Fraternal Order of Police have endorsed your nomination if you were soft on crime? Of course, not. I'm confident the American people will see through these attacks and any other last minute attempts to derail your confirmation. In closing, I want to share the words of one more Illinoian if you mind  --  if you bear with me  --  a rather famous one named Abraham Lincoln. In August 1864, at the height of the Civil War, President Lincoln addressed 166 Ohio Regiment. Lincoln said to the soldiers. And I quote, "I happened temporarily to occupy this big White House. I am living witness that one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has". Judge Jackson, we are all just temporary occupants of the Senate, the House, even with a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. You Judge Jackson are one of Mr. Lincoln's living witnesses of an America that is unafraid of challenge, willing to risk change, confident of the basic goodness of our citizens, and you are living witness to the fact that in America all is possible. I now recognize my colleague and friend, the ranking member, Senator Grassley. [*]CHUCK GRASSLEY: Judge Jackson, congratulations. Welcome to you and your family. I thank you for taking time to visit with me in my office after the President nominated you. Since President Biden announced his nominee for the Supreme Court, I've been encouraging my colleagues to schedule meetings with you, Judge Jackson, and they have come off. In addition, I've continually emphasized the need for a thorough respect for access by the committee. Now I want to talk a bit about what everyone watching should expect from this hearing and what they should expect at the hearing. We will conduct a thorough, exhaustive examination of Judge Jackson's record and views. We won't try to turn this into a spectacle based upon alleged process fouls. Good news on that front. We're off to a very good start. Unlike the start to the Kavanaugh hearings, we didn't have repeated choreographed interruptions of Chairman Durbin during his opening statements like Democrats interrupted me for more than an hour during my opening statement on the Kavanaugh hearings. What we will do, however, is ask tough questions about Judge Jackson's judicial philosophy. In any Supreme Court nomination the most important thing that I look for is the nominee's view of the law, judicial philosophy, and view on the role of a judge in our constitutional system. I'll be looking to see whether Judge Jackson is committed to the Constitution as originally understood. We all know there's a difference of opinion about the role judges should play. Some of us believe judges are supposed to interpret the law as it was understood when written, not make new law or simply fill in vacuum. Those of us who share that view think that under our Constitution Congress and not the federal courts are given the authority to make law and to set policy. Now there are others who believe that the courts should make policy. They believe in a so-called living constitution. They think that the Constitution's text and structure don't limit what a judge can do. To them deciding what the Constitution means is really a quote unquote value judgment. Under that approach, judges can exercise their own independent value judgments. One of the leading advocates for this approach explained that as a judge you quote, "Reach the answer that essentially your values tell you to reach," end of quote. In other words, those who subscribe to this philosophy think that the founders really meant to hide elephants in mouse holes. Then with a bit of creativity these judges can always find that elephant. That sounds like a good job description instead for legislators and not for judges. But for at least four years, Democrats sys  --  systematically voted against many well-credentialed nominees that were diverse professionally, diverse geographically, diverse religiously, and rever  --  diverse ethnically. Was it racist or anti-women for them to do so? I don't believe that it was. Democrats did it because the nominees didn't agree with living constitutionalism, just as Republicans have opposed nominees based upon their judicial philosophy. There are lots of problems with living constitutionalism. In the Senate, we spend a lot of time writing legislation. We argue over the language. We negotiate over how broad or narrow certain provisions of laws should be. If we can't convince our colleagues to adopt all of our ideas we have been known to compromise every once in a while. We depend on judges to interpret laws as we write them. If judges impose their own policy preferences from the bench and essentially revise the laws we passed, it makes it harder for us to write good laws. Sometimes we need to include a provision that's very broad to get a colleague's support. If a judge rewrites the law later because of vague notions about fairness or equity or common good that unravels all of our work here in the Congress. More importantly, the American people should be able to read the law and know what it means. They shouldn't have to ask how a federal judge who disagrees with a law could reinterpret the words on that page. All of this leads to the conclusion as to why we must carefully examine federal judges' records, especially Supreme Court nominees. Judge Jackson has served as an assistant public defender, worked in private practice, and served on the United States Sentencing Commission. She also served as a federal district court judge from 2013 to 2021. She served on the DC circuit since June last year. I'm sure Senators will have a few questions for Judge Jackson about the two opinions she's authored since joining the DC circuit. As for her district court record, there have been some accusations that we cherry pick some of Judge Jackson's criminal cases. Well, don't worry. We're going to talk about other cases as well. I was disappointed that we weren't able to get bipartisan agreement to ask for Judge Jackson's documents from her time as Vice Chair of the Sentencing Commission. The commission is an independent agency created to advise and assist Congress and the executive branch in the development of effective and efficient crime policy. And that's a quote. Unfortunately, it sounds like we'll have to wait until those documents are required to be released and that will be about 20 years from now. Democrats have argued for time  --  Democrats have argued that Judge Jackson's time on the commission is an important part of her experience that she'll draw on as a judge. The Democrats are right on that point. That's why it would have been good to see what her views were as the head of the commission explained in a letter to Senator Durbin, the public documents turned over to this committee represent the consensus views of the commission and not necessarily Judge Jackson's own views. The Obama White House sent us roughly 68,000 pages of material, but more than 38,000 of the 68,000 pages are repeated copies of emails, threads that keep the track  --  keeping track of the tweets about the Garland nomination. Those emails contain just one tweet about Judge Jackson. More than 13,000 of the 68,000 pages are just a list of previous nominations. So that leaves only 16,000 of 68,000 that we received from the White House that aren't obviously useless like all the other documents received. But for comparison, the White House has still withheld 48,000 pages under the Presidential Records and FOIA exemptions. Now that's a lot of hiding. But the limited number of useful records that we received from the Obama White House show exactly why the Sentencing Commission documents would have been important. There are a number of dark money groups on the left that argue federal judges should make policy decisions based on judges' own values. I've talked about the troubling role of far left dark money groups like Demand Justice have played in this Administration's judicial selection process. When the de  --  Demand Justice isn't creating shortlists for President Biden to pick judicial nominees from or putting out new litmus tests, they're running ads campaign  --  ca  --  campaigns attacking the independence of the judiciary.[*]CHUCK GRASSLEY: They've strongly supported the so-called progressive prosecutors who are soft on violent crime in the face of rising crime waves in cities like San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, and New  --  Los  Angeles. Now, what does that have to do with the nominee before us? The Obama White House Records indicate that a co-founder of the Demand Justice played an important role in Judge Jackson's nomination to the Sentencing Commission and the District Court. The Demand Justice Co-Founder even interviewed Judge Jackson about the nomination to the Sentencing Commission. It would be helpful to know what Demand Justice Co-Founder learned from that process and why they strongly support Judge Jackson. However, it hasn't all been bad on the document front, I want to make clear. We'd ask for briefs that aren't available online for D.C. circuit cases Judge Jackson worked on as an attorney At first, we were told they might not be available for a few weeks, but to our pleasant -- pleasant surprise we received them early, apparently because the White House had asked for the documents as well. Judging by timetable, We were originally given to get the briefs, that request was made after she was announced. Now those documents concern Judge Jackson's time as assistant federal public defender. Democrats have accused Republicans of vilifying nominees who have represented criminal defendants. That's just not the case, and I think that's a very unfair accusation. Previous Supreme Court nominees have also represented criminal defendants on Appeals. Chief Justice Roberts was appointed by the Supreme Court to represent a defendant in an important criminal law case and he also helped represent an in --  inmate in a Florida death row. And Justice Barrett represented a criminal defendant appealing their conviction while she was in private practice. Now, I've distinguished between two types of nominees who have worked in criminal cases. There are Bill of Rights attorneys who want to protect defendants' constitutional rights. Then there are what I've called criminal defense lawyers who disagree with our criminal laws. They want to undermine laws that they have policy disagreements with and, of course, that's a very important difference. Just a year ago  --  no, maybe it's now two years ago  --  Democrats had no trouble opposing nominees based on arguments these nominees made on behalf of clients. I could read off quotes of Democrats doing that to Trump nominees, but we only have a few minutes For these opening statements, and I'd run out of time. On a final note, during Justice Barrett's confirmation hearing, Democrats said that she would quote/unquote judicial torpedo aimed at protecting  --  protections for preexisting conditions, We heard that argument repeatedly. Conservatives and anyone who actually looked at her record and laws said that that was strictly nonsense, but Democrats were sure otherwise. Well, when that case was finally decided, Democrats were proven wrong. I'm sure that won't deter any of my Democratic colleagues from making some confident predictions this time around as well. But the public record should remember their track record, and perhaps take those claims with a grain of salt. They were wrong in their strong declarations how Justice Barrett would rule. Judge Jackson, congratulations on your nomination. I look forward to hearing from you about your record, your views on the law and your judicial philosophy. Thank you. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Grassley. Next is the president pro tem of the Senate and former chairman of the committee, Patrick Leahy. PATRICK LEAHY: Well, thank you, Mr. Chair, and I  --  Judge Jackson, welcome. It is really good to see you again. You know, today and actually throughout this week, the committee and the country are going to hear from Judge Jackson. She's been nominated to be the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Any nomination, any nomination of the court is historic. There have only been 115 justices in our nation's history. Judge Jackson's nomination, of course, is historic in more ways than one. Her nomination pending a confirmation by the Senate will bring us one step closer to having a Supreme Court that is more reflective of our nation. One where diversity, race and gender, background, education and experience allow all Americans to look to their court and see in its justices a reflection of the American people. Judge Jackson, you know, with your presence here today, you are writing a new page in the history of America. A good page. Who the President nominates and the Senate decides to confirm to our federal judiciary, and especially our nation's highest court, that's extremely important. The American people, our constituents, and their faith  --  and their faith in the courts, that's central to our democracy, They lose their faith, then democracy loses. The decisions made in our courts and ultimately in the Supreme Court affect the daily lives of each one of us. Fundamental questions about, for example, access to healthcare, the integrity of our elections, the fairness of our criminal justice system, the preservation of bedrock environmental laws, protections for workers. These issues and many more are routinely decided by the court. Every American must believe that the court is going to be impartial. They must believe that our courts are not a mere political arm of the Executive or the Congress, but faithful only to the rule of law. The stakes in a democracy are simply too high. Let's make a few things clear. Judge Jackson is no judicial activist. She is not a puppet of the so-called radical left. She's been praised by Republican-appointed judges for her jurisprudence. Lawyers from the right and the left who appeared before her in court have called her judicious and evenhanded. Before I was in the Senate, I tried a lot of cases in trial court and then courts of appeal. That's what I wanted, somebody who was judicious and evenhanded. I didn't care what their politics were. Judge Jackson is not anti-law enforcement. She hails from a law enforcement family. She's also won the support of preeminent national law enforcement organizations, including the National Fraternal Order of Police. And no, she's not soft on crime. Her background as a federal public defender would bring an informed perspective of our criminal justice system to the Supreme Court. I'm proud of being a former prosecutor, but confidence in my prosecution of a case was strongest when I knew the defendant had the best possible representation. When both sides and the presiding judge have a real grasp of our criminal justice system, that's when justice is most likely to be done. So I would say that Judge Jackson's background is not a liability to the court. It's a much needed asset to the court. And since her nomination, again here today we've heard about the long distinguished record of Judge Jackson. Graduate of Harvard, Harvard Law School, a judicial clerk at the district, circuit, and Supreme Court level, a federal appellate judge, a federal district court judge, a member of the US Sentencing Commission, an attorney in private practice, and a federal public defender. What a resume. All these experiences and perspectives have provided her a mastery of our justice system. That's in particular the criminal justice system. If she is confirmed, she'd become the first ever justice to have served as a federal public defender. That's an important experience, given how much the court shapes our criminal justice system. I say that from my experience as a senator, but also my experience for nearly a decade as a prosecutor.[*]PATRICK LEAHY: And perhaps most of all, it is Judge Jackson's nearly ten years as an appellate and trial judge that underscore the experience she would bring to the Supreme Court. She was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in 2013 to  DC Circuit Court. She served with distinction for eight years. She issued more than 500 opinions. She presided over a dozen trials. In a bipartisan majority, the Senate confirmed her to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals last year. Let's be honest. She's a fair and impartial jurist with a fidelity to the law above all else. That's what Americans want to see in a Supreme Court justice. Years of so-called judicial wars have left Americans feeling like our courts have become increasingly partisan. The extreme interests of pressure groups on both sides of the political spectrum have left the American people wondering if they can get a fair shake in our courts. And yet in this moment, we have before us a unique opportunity to change that narrative. I'm under no illusion that we can mend this process overnight, but we have before us a nominee who was brought us together across party lines before and one I hope who can bring us back together again. The Senate can change course, return to how we fairly and objectively evaluate nominees. We can do that with the highly qualified nominee we have in Judge Jackson. Now, as Chair Durbin said, I'm the president pro tempore of the senate. I'm a former chairman of this committee. I've participated in 20 prior Supreme Court nomination processes, mostly into confirmation, a small handful not. In fact, the first justice I voted on was from your state, Senator Durbin, John Paul Stevens. I've supported nominees from both Democratic and Republican Presidents. And in Judge Jackson, I've found a distinguished nominee with an unassailable record that merits our respect regardless of party. I believe the American people will see her what I've come to learn in my review of her career and her life story. Her nomination is a reflection of the arc of our democracy, the arc bends toward justice, as Dr. King once said. Although in fits and starts, with every generation we have sought to become more inclusive, more representative. We have looked to citizens, civic leaders, elected representatives, and, yes, to judges to strengthen our democracy and to recognize that our strength comes from our diversity. Judge Jackson's story, her nomination today, is part of the evolving story of America. So, Judge Jackson, I want to congratulate you on this nomination. Despite all the darkness in the world and the political brinksmanship that has unfortunately become a hallmark of Congress in recent years, your nomination actually fills me with hope, hope for the court, hope for the rule of law, hope for the country. One need look no further than the chaos, the devastation, and the humanity  --  inhumanity halfway around the world in Ukraine to know how precious our democracy is and how precious a legacy we have in our independent federal judiciary. I need look no further than my own grandchildren, all of them, to know how necessary our fight for freedom, fairness, and equality is, the independence and impartiality of our courts and of the Supreme Court, our cornerstone of the great experiment that is the United States. And you, the American people, have a nominee in whom they can be proud. We have before us an historic moment, and I hope we can meet as senators. So, I look forward to your testimony. Thank you. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Leahy. Next is another former chair of the committee and senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, congratulations, a well-deserved honor here. You have worked hard all your life and you have much to be proud of. I have said in the past that I think it's good for the court to look like America, so count me in on the idea of making the court more diverse. And in the history of our country, we've never had an African-American woman serve on the court. But I also said, that didn't get much coverage, I want  --  I want the  --  I want the court to play a particular role in America. One is make it more look like the country, but also make it operate in the confines of the Constitution. That didn't make  --  didn't get a lot of coverage. So, the hearings are going to be challenging for you, informative for the public, and respectful by us. I hope we can meet that  --  those criteria. It won't be a circus. We're off to a good start. Chairman Grassley couldn't get the first word out of his mouth before they shut down the place, so that's off to a good start. Most of us couldn't go back to our offices during Kavanaugh without getting spit on. I hope that doesn't happen to y'all. I don't think it will.As to the historic nature of your appointment, I understand. But when I get lectured about this from my Democratic colleagues, I remember Janice Rogers Brown, the African-American woman. It was filibustered by the same people praising you. I remember  --  remember Miguel Estrada, one of the finest people I ever met, completely wiped out, didn't make it through the gang of 14, whatever gang I was in. I've been in so many I can't remember. He  --  he didn't make the cut, well-lived life just completely ruined. So, if you're Hispanic or African-American conservative, it's about your philosophy. Now it's going to be about the historic nature of the pick, and it's going to be about your philosophy. The bottom line here is, when  --  it is about philosophy. When it's somebody of color on our side, it's about we're all racists if we ask hard questions. It's not going to fly with us. We're used to it by now, at least I am. So, it's not going to matter a bit to any of us. We're going to ask you what we think you need to be asked. And Senator Hawley, you need to ask her about her record as a district court judge. You should. I hope you do. And we'll see what she says, very fair game. Now, President Biden had a choice here, and he has every right to make it. Elections have consequences. He had many qualified African-American women to choose from. He chose you. Michelle Childs, a district court judge from South Carolina, supported by Jim Clyburn, that was in the mix. I think it came down to about two, three, four people, don't know for sure, but that's what the press was reporting. And when it came to Judge Childs, this Arabella [Ph] group  -- Senator Whitehouse, you talk about dark money, you may be on to something. This Arabella group is funded by Soros and some other liberal billionaire. They've got so many groups within their group I can't name them all now. But they basically said if you  --  if you pick Childs, you may have a primary opponent. The AFL-CIO said Justice  --  Judge Childs was a union buster. The attacks from the left against Judge Childs was really pretty vicious, to be honest with you.So, you say, Judge Jackson, you don't have any judicial philosophy per se. Well, somebody on the left believes you do or they wouldn't have spent the money they spent to have you in this chair. So, we're going to find out how that statement holds up over time. A viewer's guide this hearing, she will be asked about her sentencing practices as a district court judge, and she'll have a chance to explain her reasoning. And you can make up for yourself what this means, but it's good to be asked. About her legal views, I'll ask her about the law of armed conflict and her view of the law of armed conflict. The fact you're representing Gitmo detainees is not a problem with me. Everybody deserves a lawyer. You're doing the country a great service when you defend the most unpopular people. But I do want to know about your amicus briefs after you're no longer a defense counsel weighing into the Supreme Court about how they decide law of war issues. That matters a lot to me. I think it does matter that the groups that came to your aid at the expense of Judge Childs, how  --  how did that happen and why were they doing what they were doing? What is it about your nomination that the most liberal people on the  --  the umbrella of arrow  --  Arabella threw in their money, their time, their support, and threatened Joe Biden if he picked Judge Childs? I want to know more about that. I want to know about your judicial philosophy, because people on the left, the far extreme part of the left, believe that you were the best bet, and I want to know why they reached that conclusion. Maybe there's no explanation you can give us, but let  --  we'll  --  we'll talk about that.[*]LINDSEY GRAHAM: Now, when we say this is not Kavanaugh, what do we mean? It means that Democratic senators are not going to have their windows busted by groups. That's what it means. It means that no Republican Senator is going to unleash on you an attack about your character when the hearing is virtually over. None of us, I hope, have been sitting on information about you as a person for weeks or months, you come into our offices and we never share it with you to allow you to give your side of the story. We wait to the very last minute when the hearings about to be gavel concluded and say oh, by the way, I've got this letter. And so happened that every media outlet in the country had the letter too. So the next morning were headlines all over the country really, accusing Judge Kavanaugh of being basically Bill Cosby. None of us are going to do that to you And if any of us does that to you all hell will break out. And it should. The media will be your biggest cheerleader. They're in your camp. They have every right to pick who they want to pick. There won't be this constant attack on you like Judge Kavanaugh and other conservative judicial appointments. There won't be any questioning of where you go to church, what kind of groups you're in in church, how you decide to raise your kids, what you believe in, how you believe in God. Nobody's going to do that to you. And that's a good thing. So you're the beneficiary of a lot. You're the beneficiary of Republican nominees having their live turned upside down. And it didn't work. So I am hoping that we can have a hearing that's respectful, that's informative, that's challenging. And President Biden has every right to pick who he'd like to pick. That comes with winning the White House. And I've been very inclined to support the picks of people that I would not have chosen. But this is a new game for the Supreme Court. And this game is particularly disturbing to me, cause there's been a wholesale effort of the left to take down a nominee from my state. And I don't like it very much. And if that's the way the game's going to be played, then I'll have a response. And I don't expect it to be --  reward that way of playing the game. Justice Child  --  Judge Childs would have gotten 60 plus votes. There have been people in my caucus that would have voted for her, even though we knew she would be a reliable liberal vote, because I and Senator Scott would have stepped up. Now we're pick  --  now we're facing a choice sponsored by the most radical elements of the Democratic Party when it comes to how to be a judge. They have the most radical view of what a judge should do. And you were their choice. And you will be asked do you support expanding the Supreme Court? I hope you give us an answer cause it shouldn't be hard. Either you do or you don't. Justice Ginsburg said no. She thought if you just change the number of the court every time somebody new came in power it would ruin the court in the eyes of the public and make it a joke over time. I agree with that. So I hope you can give us an answer to that question. Because I think the court would be better off if the judges stood up for the court. If the judges told politicians don't play this game with the court cause over time nobody wins. So congratulations. It's going to be a couple of interesting days and we're off to a better start than we have been in the past. And the one thing I can promise you, you will not be vilified. You won't  --  you will not be attacked for your religious views. You will not be accused of something that you could not defend yourself against until it was too late. Thank you. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Graham. Senator Feinstein. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by congratulating you, Judge Jackson, on this appointment. I've reviewed the records of a number of judicial nominees during my service on this committee. This is actually the 10th set of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee that I've participated in during my time in the Senate. And looking at your record, it's clear that you have the qualifications and the experience and the knowledge needed to serve on the Supreme Court. And as a woman, it makes me very proud of that. As we begin these hearings, we as Senators take seriously our constitutional duty to advise the President on his appointment of a new Supreme Court justice. In the current term alone, the Supreme Court is addressing cases on issues that are foundational to who we are as a country. Let me just give you three examples. The court is considering a woman's fundamental right to control her own body and make her own healthcare decisions. It is considering the legal authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to fight climate change. And it's considering whether states have the power to enact common sense gun safety protections. As a former mayor, I saw how these official  --  how these problems affect people, everyday people on everyday streets throughout my city and then subsequently the state of California. This is not your first time at this. In fact, it's your fourth time in front of this committee. The full Senate has already confirmed you on a bipartisan basis three times to serve as Vice Chair of the US Sentencing Commission in 2010, as a federal district court judge 2013, and as a federal appellate court judge in 2021. And you have done us proud. Each of the three times the Senate has considered your record your experience and your ability, senators on both sides of the aisle have determined that you have the qualifications and the temperament it takes to uphold the values of our judicial branch. As I see it, those values are knowledge, evenhandedness, impartiality, integrity, respect for the rule of law, and fundamental fairness to all. And your record actually shows that you exemplify these values. The Supreme Court is not a political institution. Rather the court stands above politics and above partisanship. And we look to federal judges to be independent and unbiased. Judge Jackson, in reviewing your record one thing in particular stands out to me. And that's your commitment to uphold justice under the law. This is one of the ultimate responsibilities of the Supreme Court. And your record suggests to me that you understand the weight of that responsibility. You've had several mentors early in your career who unders  --  who I understand were important in instilling these values in you as a young lawyer. One of these  --  those mentors were Justice Stephen Breyer, who you served as a law clerk, and to whose seat on the Supreme Court you have now been nominated. What a treat for you to see that happen, and I know for him as well. Justice Breyer has been a thoughtful and evenhanded judge throughout his career. So you have learned from the best, and you have brought those lessons and that dedication to equal justice with you throughout your career in the law. You have strong credentials. You're a graduate of both Harvard University and Harvard Law School, a former Supreme Court clerk, and you have served as a federal judge for nine years, most recently on the US Court of Appeals for the district circuit. These are impressive credentials and they are also familiar to those of us who have received  --  excuse me, who have reviewed numerous nominees to the court. But you also bring experiences that are less common, especially at the Supreme Court. The first is your service as a federal public defender earlier in your career. If you were confirmed, you would be the first ever federal public defender to sit on the court. And the first justice since Thurgood Marshall with significant experience representing low income defendants in criminal cases.[*]DIANNE FEINSTEIN: I believe this is very significant and important, because as a former public defender you understand the  power of our constitutional rights, including the Sixth Amendment, right to counsel, and the Fifth Amendment, right to due process. You also understand the effect of law and the law enforcement system on the most vulnerable. And I believe your eight years of expertise as a trial judge on the DC District Court is very valuable.  I trust that my colleagues on this committee will recognize that you are unquestionably qualified for this position. I wish you well. I look forward to learning more about you over the course of the coming days. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. DICK DURBIN: Thanks, Senator Feinstein. Senator Cornyn of Texas. JOHN CORNYN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Jackson, let me join my colleagues in extending a warm welcome to you and your family. Congratulations on your nomination. I enjoyed sitting down with you recently and talking about your experience as both a lawyer and a judge, and how that's molded your views of our judicial system.  This is number eight. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to the way the Senate conducts these proceedings, and so have the American people. One of the best things I think comes from this process is I think this is a teachable moment that will remind all of us about the wisdom of the founders who wrote a constitution that made sure that our rights would be fixed in certain.  Article III, as you know, vests the Supreme Court and inferior courts with the judicial power. But the framers were very clear; the courts are not vested with a policymaking authority. According to our Constitution, courts here cases and controversies and decide them. Nothing more, Nothing less.  Part of that judgment requires a judge to go where the law commands, whether or not you personally approve or not. And it starts with deciding cases as presented, and not cherry-picking the facts or the law and starting with a decision and then justifying it by the way -- by cherry-picked facts and provisions of the law.  Unfortunately, there are some driven by their ideology that want the Supreme Court to do more than what I've just described. These are some of the same people who tried to bully Justice Breyer into an early retirement. These activists demand that the court make policy and deliver results they can't achieve through the deliberation, compromise, and rough and tumble of legislative politics.  Dark money groups like Demand Justice have paid millions of dollars to promote -- promote court packing, and sew public distrust in the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, as you know, recently warned of the crippling effect of this politicalization [Ph] of the court and its decision-making can have.  That's why it's imperative that we explore your judicial philosophy during this hearing. I will say I was a bit troubled when you -- that you have not so far provided us with much clarity on that matter. Someone as accomplished as you are who spent years engaging and thinking about our Constitution and laws has surely formed a judicial philosophy.  As someone who has deep respect for the adversarial system of justice, I understand the importance of zealous advocacy. But it appears that sometimes this zealous advocacy has gone beyond the pale, and in some instances it appears that your advocacy has bled over into your decision-making process as a judge. DICK DURBIN: Thanks, Senator Cornyn. Senator Whitehouse, Rhode Island.[*]SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: Thank you very much, Chairman. Welcome, Judge Jackson. I could not be more delighted to have you here. This is a refreshing moment. We are holding a hearing for an accomplished, experienced, highly-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court who came to us not through a dark money fund turnstile, but through a fair and honest selection process, Judge Jackson has unparalleled breadth of experience both on and off the bench. She has already been confirmed by the Senate three times. She serves on what is often called the second highest court in the land. The DC Circuit handles some of the most difficult and consequential cases in the nation, often taking up questions that later come before the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson, that will enable you to jump right in once confirmed. Before the DC Circuit, Judge Jackson was a trial judge in the district court in the District of Columbia ruling on hundreds of cases and presiding over trials, including many jury trials. Judge Jackson, you have presided over virtually every kind of case a federal trial judge can hear across criminal and civil law. You have more experience actually trying cases in your courtroom than any other member of the court. As a member of the US Sentencing Commission you helped establish the policies and practices for federal courts when deciding criminal punishments. With commissioners from both parties, you helped implement our bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act. Complicated and consequential work. And we thank you. It matters to me, Mr. Chairman, that Judge Jackson was also a civil litigator and public defender. She wasn't groomed in partisan petri dishes. She learned practical courtroom experience in both civil and criminal law, how the judicial system works, and how it serves or doesn't serve different litigants. And I must say that in Rhode Island, we love that before you clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer, you clerked for Rhode Islander Bruce Selya, on the First Circuit. Judge Selya was nominated by Ronald Reagan. He is well-regarded by bench and bar and he thinks the world of Judge Jackson. She is absolutely everything you would want in a Supreme Court justice, he told The Boston Globe in February. She has all the tickets in terms of her intelligence, her education, her work experience, and her demonstrated judicial temperament. He actually said that waiting for the Supreme Court selection process to take place made him feel like a father waiting to hear his daughter's college admissions results, we very much appreciate that Rhode Island touch to this nomination. Judge Jackson is steadfastly committed to the Constitution and the rule of law and her record reflects the type of evenhandedness and independence that will make her such a good Supreme Court justice. Her guiding principle, she has said, is to consistently apply the same level of analytical rigor to a case no matter who or what is involved in the legal action. She says this means you can quoting again, "be consistent in the way you are analyzing the issues and you can set aside any thoughts about who is making the arguments and what advantages any side might take away from your opinions. If you have fidelity to the rule of law that is grounded in looking at only those inputs", she said, "then I think you can rule without fear or favor". Mr. Chairman, Judge Jackson will be an exemplary Justice both because of the qualities that she possesses and because she did not undergo a secret pre-selection process to get here. She is before us on the basis of her own merit, not on the recommendation of a secretive right wing donor operation hiding behind anonymous multimillion dollar donations and aimed at capturing the United States Supreme Court as if it were some 19th century railroad commission. The unpleasant fact is that the present court is the court that dark money built. Anonymous donations funded the Federalist Society while it housed the selection turnstile run by the dark money donors. Anonymous money funded the dark money group down the same hallway as the Federalist Society that ran the dark money political campaigns for the selected justices. And because of all that secrecy, Americans are denied any real understanding of the overlap of all that dark money with the political dark money funding the Republican Party, which could well explain the wreckage of Senate norms, rules, and procedures that accompanied the confirmation process of recent nominees. Judge Jackson's nomination and the process by which she was selected stand in sharp contrast. President Biden undertook a thorough and independent review of her record and she will proceed through a thorough and fair process here in the Senate. We will abide by the new precedent set by Republicans in recent years, but we will not be fabricating new ones. We've already seen dark money groups use dark money to run ads, charging that dark money swayed this selection. We are hearing that again today. Ironic when hundreds of millions of dollars in right wing dark money built the current court majority and still signals its wishes through flotillas of dark money front groups posing as [Untranslated]. I welcome the debate on these points and I look forward to hearing more from the excellent nominee before us. Judge Selya counted the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an old friend. I see some of the same qualities in Ketanji that I saw in Ruth, he said. Humility, the ability to inspire others in a quiet way, not at the top of her voice. Some people, he said, have the capacity to inspire by example and the force of their reason. Judge Jackson, I'm certain your capacity to inspire through force of reason will be on display here this week. Thank you. Chairman Durbin, for your leadership of the hearing. And thank you Judge Jackson for being with us today. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Senator Lee of Utah. MIKE LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge Jackson for joining us today. I appreciated the conversation you and I had in my office a few days ago and your willingness to engage in lively, interesting conversation during that; look forward to more of that this week. I've enjoyed also meeting your husband and your two lovely daughters. They're wonderful people. I'm grateful to you for your service  --  your service to the federal judiciary and as a member of the bar. You bring to the court, as I mentioned to you last week, a unique set of  --  of experiences. If you're confirmed, you will be someone who has served at all three levels of the federal judiciary. And as a result of that, you'll have a perspective that's different and that of most who have served on that court during the modern era. And I appreciate your willingness to be considered and to be here to talk to us about our questions. I echo what many of my colleagues have said today and that I am dedicated as I always have been to making sure that these hearings are respectful. Engaging in the politics of personal destruction is not something we should ever aspire to. It is something that has occurred on this committee in the context of Supreme Court nominations. I'm pleased to say that it has never been under Republican leadership that such attacks have occurred and I intend to make sure that this hearing is no exception to that. There are a few reasons for that. First and foremost, the most obvious is that respect to human beings requires it. Secondly, it's important because we if focus on personal attacks, that means we will be betraying our duty under the Constitution and to our constituents to make sure that we do our jobs fairly and properly. When we're focused on things that we have no business doing, like bringing forward spurious, last minute, uncorroborated accusations that are personal nature, we neglect the importance of talking about the jurisprudential role that they've  --  the philosophy that guides individual jurors and the document that we're all sworn to uphold and protect, the Constitution of the United States.[*]MIKE LEE: It's also important for an additional reason  --  a third reason, it has to do with the fact that having been nominated to this position, we know  you stand a very decent likelihood of ultimately being confirmed to this position, in which case you will serve as a member of the Supreme Court of the United States. And I think it's important that even when -- especially when we disagree with decisions issued by that tribunal, we as -- as a committee, as the Senate Judiciary Committee, not engage in speech or behavior that would undermine the legitimacy of the Supreme Court of the United States. You see, it's the legitimacy of the courts that gives them their potence, their power, their significance in our system of government. And we all have a duty to make sure that we don't undermine that very thing that we purport to be protecting. Let me tell you some of the things that I look for when reviewing a nominee and a few things that I intend to focus on in these hearings with you. One of them will involve any nominee's commitment to judicial self-restraint, to understanding the judicial role, for what it is and what it is not. Any judicial nominee these days will acknowledge that he or she understands that the role of the judge is to interpret the law based on what it says, rather than on the basis of a judge's personal opinion. This is all very true. It raises questions as to how exactly that goes about and what steps, what tools, what rhetorical linguistic devices the jurist in question might follow in order to do that. I'm looking for someone who is ideally going to echo something that Justice Amy Coney Barrett said in her confirmation proceedings, in which she likened the Constitution, this document written by wise men nearly two and a half centuries ago; wise men who I believe were raised up by Almighty God to that very purpose. To the extent we followed that document, it's helped foster the development of the greatest civilization the world has ever known. But she  --  she likened this and our commitment to it as a little like what Odysseus told his crew. She said, the Constitution is like how Odysseus ties himself to the mast to resist the song of the sirens. She then goes on to  --  to explain that he told the crew, do not untie me. No matter how much I beg or plead, don't untie me from the mast. He wanted to avoid the tempting call of the sirens. Attempting call of the sirens is inherent. In government itself, It's  --  it's understandable, and that's why we tie ourselves to it. Critical to that is the federal judiciary, the ultimate backstop, the  --  the backstop that's there to resolve disputes. Now, the Constitution isn't just something for the courts. It's not something that's owned exclusively and independently by the federal judiciary or the Supreme Court itself. But it does play an important role, because the court's there to resolve disputes that arise within the court's jurisdiction as to the meaning of a particular provision of federal law, whether in the Constitution itself or as enacted into law by Congress. So we need a jurist who's willing just to respect that rule and demonstrate judicial humility. What I mean by that is an ability to acknowledge that there are a lot of things not within the province of the courts that entail policy; that the job of the court of the judiciary is never to exert will or force. It is only judgment. It's discerning what the law says. A nominee also, I believe, needs to show a steadfast commitment to the principle of separation of powers. There are a couple of forms of separation of powers required by the Constitution along two axes. One operates along the vertical axis that we call federalism, that says most of the power of government within the United States  --  most powers that government might exercise are to be exercised at the state and local level. Power that's federal is the exception, not the norm, in our constitutional system of government. The other form of separation of powers operates along the horizontal axis. It's one that recognizes within the federal government, which is limited, we're going to have one branch, and our branch is Congress that makes the laws. Another branch headed by the President, the Executive Branch that enforces it, and the third branch which interprets them, resolving disputes between parties coming before the court's jurisdiction. Third, I think it's important that a jurist within our system of government acknowledge the importance of interpreting the law as it was written, as it was understood by the public at the time of its enactment, if a statute or if a provision of the Constitution at the time of its ratification. This is part of how we tie ourselves to the mast, making sure that we undertake efforts to make sure that we're interpreting it based on how the public understood those words, regardless of the subjective intent of any particular lawmaker or group thereof. The public meaning at the time it became law. This is how we maintain the rule of law. This is part of how we've  --  we've given force to this greatest civilization that human history has ever recorded. It's through the rule of law and tying ourselves to that mast. There are increasing threats to this. We've seen those threats arise with efforts to delegitimize the court. And I  --  I'm sickened every time I see or hear or experience one of those efforts to delegitimize it. We've heard some today, in fact, comments that I think by their very nature delegitimize the court. Another thing that can de-legitimize the court are arguments made in favor of packing the Supreme Court. This was attempted by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1937. It did lasting damage to the court. It didn't succeed as a legislative matter, but it's arguable that it left a mark, and not a pretty one. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires us to have nine and only nine justices. That is, under the Constitution, left to Congress's determination. But nine is a number that works. It's worked now for 152 years. It's not one that we ought to revisit, and it's one that Supreme Court justices of various ideologies, including your former boss Justice Breyer, whom I really enjoyed getting to know when serving as a law clerk on the Supreme Court. I enjoyed our conversations with him. He, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Thomas, and so many others have been against that. We must protect the court. We may not protect the court. We lose ability to protect the court if we allow arguments to take root that are focused on expanding that, and turning the court into a political body. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Lee. Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Chairman Durbin, and thank you, Ranking Member Grassley. Judge Jackson, welcome. We met recently in my office, and we have seen you in this committee before and we are so happy to have you back. If Senator Whitehouse is pleased that you once clerked for a Rhode Island judge, we in Minnesota are equally happy that you are wearing bold purple today, winning over both Prince and Minnesota Vikings fans the world over. I'd like to welcome your husband Patrick and your two daughters, and your other family members and friends. It is clear that your family, starting with your parents, who I got to meet who are sitting there in the front row, who once worked as teachers, that your family has been a constant source of inspiration and support for you. My mom taught second grade until she was 70 years old. So I know firsthand it's pretty great to have a parent who was also a teacher, and they never stop checking your spelling. As a lawyer who also balanced work with parenthood myself, I particularly enjoyed your story, Judge, about sitting with your dad. You had a coloring book and he was studying his law books. While these hearings are truly an opportunity, as my colleagues have pointed out, for Americans to get to know your legal acumen, we also learn about your background, your experiences, your values. And for so many of us, including people watching this hearing across the country, our values start with our family. There is something else particularly special about this hearing, of course. You've been nominated by President Biden as the first black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. That's historic. With 115 justices having served so far in our history, you're the first black woman and it's long past time. In fact, this entire hearing is about opening things up. The hearing room, we've opened it up with actual guests for the first time in a while.[*]AMY KLOBUCHAR: And you're opening up the Senate and the court by virtue of your very presence. You, Judge, are opening a door that's long been shut to so many. And by virtue of your strong presence, your skills, your experience, you are showing so many little girls and little boys across the country that anything and everything is possible. We're here to carry out one of this committee's most solemn constitutional obligations, to advise and consent on President Biden's nomination to the Supreme Court. But this is also a time for us to consider the Supreme Court's place in our democracy and how it impacts people. You've been nominated to Justice Breyer's seat. You clerked for him, and I know he's been and is a wonderful mentor to you, so I'd like to start with some of his words. Justice Breyer once wrote that the Supreme Court must help maintain public acceptance of its own legitimacy. He said it can do this best by helping ensure that the Constitution remains workable in a broad sense of the term. Specifically, it can and should interpret the Constitution in a way that works for the people of today, making it work for the people of today. Those words, his words, are highly relevant to the court. And Justice Breyer didn't just write about those values. In his 27 years on the court, he lived them. He approached cases with a pragmatic view of the law, and he understood that reference to the Constitution requires not just a respect for the past, although it does that, but also an eye toward the future. As we are here to confirm a new justice for his seat, I urge my colleagues to remember his words about how the court must consider the effect of its actions on people's lives, how it must be able to see the real people at the other end of its rulings, like Americans who are one Supreme Court decision away from Losing their health insurance or one court decision away from the ability to make their own healthcare choices, or the Dreamers who could lose the only country they've ever known, or the people who waited for hours in the rain one recent Election Day in Wisconsin, wearing garbage bags and homemade masks in the middle of what would soon become a global pandemic, just to cast a ballot, just to exercise their constitutional right to vote. The court decides cases with life-changing consequences for people. It makes decisions that dictate health and safety standards for workers, protections for seniors, whether we can have clean air and clean water. The Supreme Court issues rulings that can determine who can make their voices heard in our democracy and how they can do it. So, Judge Jackson, this week I look forward to hearing more on your views about the real world implications of the law and about how you will respect the Constitution and legal precedent, all the while striving to ensure we have a court that works for the American people. Judge, I believe you have exactly the sort of understanding of what the law means in people's lives that Americans would want in a justice. You're from a family that knows something about making it work. Both of your parents attended segregated primary schools and later became teachers. And when your dad set his sights on becoming a lawyer, your mom figured out how to support the family while he attended law school.After being a star debater in high school, you went on to graduate magna cum laude in college and went on to graduate with honors from law school. After law school, you clerked for federal judges nominated by both Democratic and Republican Presidents, and of course you had the honor of serving as a clerk to Justice Breyer.These aren't just lines on your resume. They show that you have worked to apply the law at every level of the federal system. And beyond those credentials, you have the perspectives of someone who has seen the law through the eyes of those closest to it. Your brother worked as a police officer in Baltimore. One of your uncles was a detective and another was the chief of police of the city of Miami. You know what it means for a person to put their life on the line to defend the rule of law. It is no surprise to me that you received the letter that Senator Durbin mentioned, the letter of support from the Fraternal Order of Police. And as a former federal public defender, you also understand that, for a justice system to be truly workable, it must account for those who lack the resources to defend themselves, and you would be the first justice to bring that experience to the court. Judge, I believe it is because of your experience and respect for the law that the Senate has confirmed you three times with bipartisan support as vice chair and commissioner of the US Sentencing Commission, judge on the DC District Court, and most recently the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.In each of these roles, you've lived up to that bipartisan support. As a commissioner, over 90% of the votes you participated in were either unanimous or voice votes. As a district court judge, you wrote nearly 600 opinions applying the law and precedent to the facts fairly and impartially without regard to your personal views. I will note that if you are confirmed, you will join Justice Sotomayor as the only other justice on the bench with experience as a trial court judge. As a circuit court judge, you have written decisions joined by judges appointed by presidents of both parties.And let's not forget you have nine years of judicial experience, more than four other justices currently on the court prior to their confirmations, not that we're counting. Judge Jackson, and I expect this to come through loud and clear during these hearings, you have the experience and record of a jurist who is dedicated to the fair application of the law, committed to consensus, and determined to make sure that the court and the Constitution work for the people of today.And one last point. Judge, your confirmation hearing comes at a moment in our history when the people of this country are once again seeing, this time in Ukraine, that democracy can never be taken for granted. Eternal vigilance, it's been said, is the price of liberty. Last week, I was at the Ukrainian-Polish border with refugees streaming through checkpoints, leaving everything they had behind with only a suitcase and a backpack, walking into the loving arms of their neighbors in Poland, a country with a long, hard history of having been invaded by Nazis and Russians and Prussians and Habsburgs.As our ambassador there told me, at this moment in history, the people of Poland are achieving the dreams their grandparents could never realize. They are saying to their Ukrainian neighbors we value freedom and respect your democracy. We value you so much that we will take you into our homes and into our hearts. We will open our doors and not shut you out. And this horrendous war against evil and the courage of the Ukrainian people is happening at the very same time our country is opening our minds after being separated through a two year pandemic from our neighbors, not only around the world, but in our own country, in our own towns. This moment bestows upon us a new opportunity to see one another again and to be part of our own democracy, to respect each other's rights and views, to see that we are not a nation of 300 plus million silos. Instead, we are a nation that must re-embrace the simple principle that unites us as Americans, and that is that our country is so much bigger in what unites us than what divides us. That's the pivotal moment we are in. That's your moment.It's a time for us to consider what the courts mean to our democracy, to recall how the framers envisioned the courts to work as a ballast in our system of government, and to rededicate ourselves to the sacred protection of our rights and the upholding of our Constitution. So, as we move forward with these hearings, let us be grounded in the central role of the court and the Constitution in our democracy, of what it means to our system of government that we can never take for granted and how we must always be vigilant that it is serving the people.Judge Jackson, I'm confident you will come to the bench as a justice with a bedrock appreciation of what the Constitution and the law means to America with the real world perspective we need. Thank you for your willingness to serve at this important time. DICK DURBIN: Thanks, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Cruz of Texas. TED CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Jackson, congratulations on your nomination. 11,107 men and women have served as members of the House of Representatives. 1,994 men and women has served as members of the United States Senate. Only 115 men and women have served as Supreme Court justices. The position to which you have been nominated is extraordinarily important.[*]TED CRUZ: And that is why the Senate is given the responsibility for advice and consent under the Constitution, because the job matters immensely. Supreme Court confirmations were not always controversial. In fact, Bushrod Washington, when nominated to the Supreme Court in 1798, was confirmed the very next day. So what changed? Well, what changed is starting in the 1960s, in the 1970s, the Supreme Court's role in our society changed dramatically. The Supreme Court became a policymaking body rather than a merely judicial body. Just a moment ago my colleague Senator Klobuchar said we should consider the Supreme Court's place in our democracy. Well, starting in the sixties and seventies, the Supreme Court decided its place in our democracy at least to many justices was to set aside the democratic decisions of the people and instead to mandate the policy outcomes they themselves supported. Our Democratic colleagues want the Supreme Court to be anti-democratic. Our Democratic colleagues get frustrated with the democratic process. When they can't pass gun control laws because the American people don't support them they want unelected judges to mandate those same laws instead. Law after law after law that they can't get through the democratic process, The Democrats have decided it's much simpler to convince five lawyers in black robes than to try to convince 330 million Americans. That is why Supreme Court confirmation hearings have be -- become so contentious is because the Supreme Court has arrogated to itself a responsibility the Constitution doesn't give it. Which is to make contested policy decisions and take them away from the American people. Now what should this hearing be and what should it not be? Well, you've heard a number of members on the Republican side of the aisle quite clear on what it should not be. This will not be a political circus. This will not be the kind of character smear that sadly our Democratic colleagues have gotten very good at. And it's important to note, you know, a couple of years ago I was doing my weekly podcast and I was on with a noted liberal intellectual who made a comment something to the effect of well, both sides do this. Both sides smear Supreme Court justices. And I was forced to laugh out loud and say look, I understand that's a pretty good talking point. It just happens not to be true. It is only one side of the aisle, the Democratic aisle, that went so into the gutter with Judge Robert Bork that they invented a new verb, to bork someone. It is only one side of the aisle that with Justice Clarence Thomas was so reprehensible that his  --  the President who nominated him, President George Herbert Walker Bush, wrote at the time quote, "What's happening to Clarence Thomas is just plain horrible. All the groups that tried to beat him up on abortion or affirmative action have now come out of the woodwork." "They are trying to destroy a decent man. This is an ugly process and one can see clearly why so many good people elect to stay out of public life." As Justice Thomas observed in that hearing, what happened there was to use his words a high tech lynching. And I would note the chairman who presided over that disgrace was Joe Biden. And then most of the members of this committee remember the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, one of the lowest moments in the history of this committee. Where Democrats on this committee sat on allegations, didn't refer them to the FBI, didn't ask for investigations, hid them, and then leaked them against the wishes of the complainant. And we began a circus that featured Spartacus moments, featured such nuts as Michael Avenatti, whom CNN breathlessly for some months described as a possible Democratic Presidential candidate. That's before presumably he became a felon in recent months. Judge Jackson, I can assure you that your hearing will feature none of that disgraceful behavior. No one is going to inquire into your teenage dating habits. No one is going to ask you with mock severity do you like beer. But that's not to say this hearing should be non-substantive and non-vigorous. In this hearing this committee has a responsibility to focus on issues, to focus on your record, to focus on substance. To do our very best to ascertain what kind of justice you would be. And a couple of straw men. It is no longer the case that Supreme Court confirmation hearings are merely about qualifications. There are some who say, well, if the justice is qualified the Senate should confirm. There was a time that was the case. Our Democratic colleagues have abandoned that standard long ago. Our Democratic colleagues, then Senator Joe Biden was perfectly happy to vote against John Roberts, someone who was unquestionably qualified for the court. He was perfectly happy to vote against Sam Alito, someone who was unquestionably qualified for the court. And indeed every member of our Democratic colleagues who was here at the time participated in the first ever filibuster of a Supreme Court justice on partisan lines with Justice Neil Gorsuch. They did so for someone unquestionably qualified, but they had a political agenda. And so every one of them happily filibustered Justice Gorshuch  --  Gorsuch. Likewise, it's not about race. We will see Democrats in the media suggest that any Senator that is skeptical of your nomination, that questions you vigorously, or that dares to vote against you must somehow harbor racial animus. If that were the standard I would note we are sitting on a committee where multiple members of this committee, the senior Democrats in the committee, happily filibustered Judge Janice Rogers Brown, a very qualified African-American woman nominated to the DC circuit. And they did so precisely because they wanted to prevent Judge Brown from becoming Justice Brown, the first African-American [woman]. Joe Biden was among the Democrats filibustering the first African-American woman nominated to the DC circuit. The senior Democrats on this committee also filibustered Miguel Estrada. As the staff for Senator Ted Kennedy said in writing at the time, the Democrats filibustered Miguel Estrada quote, "Because he is Hispanic." They were explicitly racial. If you dare  --  if you are Hispanic or African-American and you dare depart from their political orthodoxy they will crush you, they will attack you, they will slander you, they will filibuster you. So this is not about race. It is however about issues and substance. And I got to say I agree with Chairman Durban. Chairman Durbin quoted Paul Simon and he said history will judge quote, "Did she restrict freedom or did she expand it?" I agree with that. The reason the American people care about the Supreme Court is it is integral to protecting or taking away our constitutional rights. When it comes to free speech, this committee should inquire will you protect the rights of Americans to speak, to say unpopular ideas, to say ideas that the government doesn't want you to say that you nonetheless have a right to say? Will you protect freedom or restrict it? When it comes to religious liberty, will a justice vote to protect your right to live according to your faith and according to your conscience, or will a justice vote to crush religious liberty and strip those rights away? The second amendment. Will a justice vote to defend your second amendment rights to keep and bear arms, to defend your family, to defend your children, or will a justice roll over to the Democrats that want a disarmed citizenry? And the right to life. Will a justice protect the rights of the people, the rights of state legislatures to enact laws protecting innocent life, protecting unborn life, but  --  stopping abominations like partial birth abortion. Or will a justice view her job as a super legislator striking down all such rights? School choice. Will a justice protect the rights of kids to get a quality education or will a justice legislate from the bench and shut down school choice programs across this country? And crime. We are seeing murder rates, carjacking rates, crime rates skyrocketing across the country, in significant part because political Soros backed district attorneys, because of Democratic efforts to abolish the police. And part of the Democratic effort to abolish the police is nominating justices that consistently side with violent criminals, release violent criminals, refuse to enforce the law, and that results in jeopardizing in  --  innocent citizens. So all of those questions are fair game. Will you follow the law? What does your record indicate? Will you protect the rights of every American citizen regardless of race, regardless of party, regardless of views? That's what the focus of this hearing should be. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator. Senator Coons from Delaware. [*]CHRISTOPHER COONS: Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley. Judge Jackson, congratulations on your nomination. It is a joy and a blessing to welcome you and your family and your supporters here this morning, as both Senators Klobuchar and Cruz have laid out in great and forceful detail. The decisions of the United States Supreme Court have daily impact, regular bearing, on the lived experience of Americans. And that is in part why hearings for this important role are so contentious. I have been looking forward to this day since President Biden announced your nomination in February. And over the next several days, members of this committee will have the privilege of helping introduce you to the American people, so that they can gain the sense of confidence that I have in your values, your skills, your competence, and the necessity of confirming you to the Supreme Court. We'll be inviting you to speak directly to the American public and share the lived experiences, the strong qualifications, the judicial temperament, and the strength of character that made you not only an historic nominee to the Supreme Court, but an outstanding one as well.  I want to acknowledge upfront that President Biden selected you to fill the seat on the court being vacated by Justice Breyer, a justice whom I admire. And in the work he's done as a jurist over decades, has shown us a model of a Supreme Court justice. In his 42 years on the federal bench, 30 years on the Supreme Court, he's lived up to the highest ideals of American jurisprudence. He has served with wisdom, with fairness and respect for the Constitution, the laws of our nation and its people. He has a keen legal mind and a love of the law that are obvious to anyone who's heard him ask questions or read his decisions, and certainly to someone who clerked for him on the Supreme Court and who has had the benefit of his mentorship over many, many years. You've had broad experience in your stellar legal career that will make you a unique contributor to the Supreme Court. You've worked as a lawyer or as a judge in just about every level of our legal system, engaging in just about every area of federal law. Your experiences as a private practice attorney with large law firms, as a federal public defender; as vice chair of the US Sentencing Commission; and your near-decade of service as a federal judge have given you insights into the ways that our Constitution, our statutes, our sentencing guidelines and judicial decisions all come together to directly impact individuals, families and our communities. You're able to perceive the full sweep of our law without losing sight of the human beings, the individuals and families impacted by it, caught up in it. And it Is critically important in my view that we have justices on the Supreme Court with this practical and proximate view. You began your legal career with the invaluable experience of clerking for judges at the federal district court, at the circuit court, and for Justice Breyer on the Supreme Court; judges appointed by Presidents of both parties. You developed your career as a legal advocate in private practice and in the federal public defender service. As part of this work, you took on complex cases involving challenging and unsettled areas of the law. You worked pro-bono on behalf of clients without regard to their political views or the political consequences of those cases. And you helped ensure bedrock constitutional guarantees in our legal system held strong, even in times of great stress and crisis. The work you did In these roles distinguished you as a talented appellate litigator with a formidable legal mind. You helped to craft policy as counsel to the US Sentencing Commission, the independent agency within the judicial branch that establishes sentencing guidelines followed by all federal judges. And then years later, you served again on the commission as its vice chair. While on the US Sentencing Commission, You partnered with colleagues whose perspectives on the law spanned the ideological spectrum. And together you enacted meaningful reforms, designed to reduce unjust disparities And increase fairness in sentencing. In the days ahead, I expect to discuss tour Sentencing Commission experience with you in some detail. Nearly all the decisions you were a part of while serving on the commission were unanimous, and they grew out of a careful consideration of highly complex numerous factors, and involved commissioners working hard to achieve common ground. In at least one notable instance, you ended up joining two conservative commissioners to oppose an amendment because you thought the law required a different result, and you followed the law. Something that often gets lost in our debates and discussions about the Supreme Court is that many, in some terms a majority, of Supreme Court decisions are unanimous, or decided by very broad majorities. These decisions are every bit as critical to the rule of law and the functioning and legitimacy of the Court as the handful that are very contentious and widely discussed publicly. Your service on the Sentencing Commission and your time on the circuit court have prepared you to be a positive force for consensus among the justices in this challenging chapter in American history. I also think we will have some extended discussions this week about your record of service on the federal bench. You were confirmed to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia in 2013, and have written more than 500 published opinions. You were confirmed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals last year. And in your near-decade as a judge, you've authored opinions in cases spanning a myriad of complicated issues, from administrative law to civil rights, from criminal environmental matters, labor and employment law, national security and sovereign immunity, immigration law and many more. Your rich, complex, and deep decisional record gives us the best possible evidence of what kind of justice you will be. And I've concluded you are judicious and impartial; great qualities for a justice. In every case, you methodically consider the parties' arguments, the relevant facts and the Law, including, of course, the foundation of the Constitution, the text of applicable statutes and the precedents that apply. And ultimately from what I've seen, you come to a decision based on that methodology, not on any particular policy preferences or activism. This committee has also received a striking outpouring of support for your nomination from a very broad range of sources. I'm certain we'll be hearing about some of the more enthusiastic statements in detail in the coming days. But in several of the letters I've had a chance to review personally, I've been struck. These were letters from lawyers that held appointed positions in Republican administration  --  administrations, letters from prominent law enforcement organizations, federal judges appointed by Republican Presidents. They praise your qualifications, your character, your experience and your commitment to evenhanded and impartial judging, and the rule of law. This is the fourth Supreme Court nomination process in which I'm participating as a senator. And I know our role In confirming a justice to the highest court is among the most solemn obligations we have as senators. As we begin this week's hearings, I remain hopeful that we can come together as a committee and engage in respectful good faith bipartisan consideration of your nomination. I look forward to your testimony this week. I'm excited so many of my colleagues have had a chance to get to know you a bit, to meet with you, to talk with you one-on-one and get a sense of your  -- your character, your experiences and your background, and then will have the opportunity to question you to bring that out in more detail. I have every expectation that at the end of this week's hearings, it'll be clear to all that you are impeccably qualified in the law. And I think it will be plain to any American watching. You have a demonstrated record of excellence. As a jurist, you will decide cases as a justice on the basis of the facts and the law, and that you will be faithful to the Constitution. It's also my hope folks will get a chance to meet the family that shaped you. It was delightful to have a few moments to get to talk with your parents and your brother before we began today. And to reflect on how having parents, graduates of HBCUs, public school teachers, who then went on to great careers of accomplishment. Johnny Brown Esquire and Dr. Ellery Brown set a great standard. But frankly, to me, one of the most memorable sentences before this was in talking to your brother Ketajh who said, oh, I'm not surprised to be here at all. This was the sort of thing for which my sister was destined from the very start. Destined perhaps, but today you are beginning a process of walking through this door because of courage, humility, determination and a commitment to excellence. Just as another person in American history, Ruby Bridges, walked through a critical door in our history, with her chin held high, her back held straight, and a fierce determination to make a difference. So you, too, today begin the process of walking through this next open door with the sort of sparkling wit, brilliant mind, and commitment to excellence that will make its mark in American history. I look forward to your opening and to this week. Thank you, Your Honor. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Coons. Senator Sasse of Nebraska. BEN SASSE: Thank you, Chairman.[*]BEN SASSE: Chris is tough to follow. That was a -- a lo -- a good flourish at the end. Judge, congratulations on your nomination. Thanks for spending time in my office with me. Congratulations to your daughters and your family more broadly. This is a big day for -- for lots of folks in your --  in your family. Today the Senate takes up our constitutional duty to advise the President on his nominee to the Supreme Court. The Senate's advise and consent clause and our role is especially important these days when we all, Republicans and Democrats agree that the nine justices of the court exercise a lot of power over policy decisions. Surely much, much more power than our Constitution's framers ever anticipated. So let's talk about how we got into this mess. We're here in part because of decades and decades of recklessness by all three branches. Not just one, but by all three. Congress, the article one branch, fails to carry out our tasks responsibly and regularly. Rather than make tough policy choices we pass incredibly vague laws and then just push the details on down Pennsylvania Avenue to unelected bureaucrats in the article two branch. Then the head of the executive branch, meanwhile, whichever party he or she comes from, grabs more and more power with their pens and their phones. And finally, the Supreme Court at the top of article three, tends to overstep the bounds that the Constitution sets on judicial power. The court has ignored restrictions on its authority, inserting itself into policy debates that are supposed to be entrusted exclusively to the two political branches. And what do we mean by that? What do we mean when we say articles one and two are political. It means that the people are in power over articles one and two, but not in the long term over article three. The men and women in article one and article two are supposed to be answering directly to the American people, and importantly the American people get to hire us or get to fire us every two, four, or six years. But rather than honor the roles given to each branch, activist judges usurp the powers given to articles one and two, which articles one and two were complicit in this overreach. Many years of corroding our constitutional order have contributed to the polarization and the viciousness that are poisoning our politics more broadly. We all know that our civic health and our civic life is not healthy. And as was mentioned at the beginning of the hearing, it's at least good that this one got kicked off without a bunch of yokels having to be arrested and carried from the room. When Chairman Grassley tried to speak a couple years ago at one of these it took, like, an hour to get started. That kind of nonsense, the theatrics that happen at these hearings are because of a broader problem. As textualist and originalists have sought to return the court to its historic role, the Supreme Court nomination process has been increasingly punctuated with not just those theatrics but also with lots of personal attacks. That's not what this process is supposed to be. This process is supposed to be a careful, thorough investigation of a nominee's record to help the Senate make an informed decision on a nominee's fitness for a lifetime appointment. That's why these hearings are supposed to be different, not cause people act like jack wagons, but because the people before us, nominated by the President, are potentially going to serve for a lifetime. That office, Supreme Court Justice, is incredibly important yet it's also carefully circumscribed precisely because it's a lifetime responsibility. But we know that it's been a long time since this process has worked like that. Instead, this is often a staging ground for nasty evidence free personal attacks. We started down this road of character assassination in the 1980s with Judge Bork's hearings and Senators have been engaged in disgusting theatrics ever since. The most recent Supreme Court nominee was subjected to repeated accusations that were nothing more than unfiltered religious bigotry against her. The nominee before her was accused of serial rape, aided by members of this committee. If this process were conducted in good faith Miguel Estrada and Janice Rogers Brown might well be on the Supreme Court today. But their opponents lied and bullied rather than accepted principled minority judges. We've gotten so used to this kind of bullying that two years ago, the current Senate majority leader stood on the steps of the United States Capitol and screamed threats against two sitting justices of the Supreme Court that they would quote, reap the whirlwind if they ruled in a way that didn't align with Chuck Schumer's political preferences. That's weird. We should all be able to pause and say that's weird. That kind of behavior shouldn't happen. This process is broken, but it's a product of a broader brokenness in the erosion of our constitutional structure. A lot of people are willing to take a sledgehammer to the structure if it offers them a quick political win. And it's no coincidence that as more of us embrace an ends justifies the means philosophy of our jobs, which are supposed to be jobs of public trust, our politics becomes uglier, more brutal, and more pathological. Well, we have an opportunity today to do something different. And we can demonstrate that the Congress can carry out its constitutional duty responsibly without a lot of that past ugliness. Judge Jackson has served for the last nine months on the prestigious US circuit court of appeals for the DC circuit. And before that you spent eight years on the DC district court. She has a long record of public service and a long roster of colleagues and friends who will testify to her professionalism. The President believes that she should have a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, and it's the job of this body to evaluate that recommendation on its merits. So what should we be looking for? We should start with judicial philosophy. The Senate should have a good sense of the principles that will guide a nominee's decision making on the bench. A robust and thorough judicial philosophy can help us  --  help us understand how, when faced with difficult or unprecedented decisions as the court occasionally is  --  and I would just like to compliment Senator Coons a minute ago mentioning that a huge, huge share of decisions that come out of the Supreme Court are actually nine to zero. They just tend to not be the ones that make the headlines, but they're incredibly important. And the public trust that we need to restore in all three branches of government would be well served by us paying more attention to some of those nine zero decisions. But the ones that tend to be most contentious and the ones that tend to generate the most headlines are the occasions where judges have to figure out what they do in areas which are gray and ambiguous where the law might not be clear. And so it make  --  it's incredibly important for a judge to tell us how she or he works out those principles in times that are  --  are new and confusing. This will make their rulings more durable and sound and it will help rebuild public trust in the court and in the government more generally. Unfortunately too many of the court's decisions do not rest on solid constitutional foundations and reliable legal reasoning. Justices have too often written decisions to claim partisan policy victories and then retrofit bad legal reasoning or political decision making to justify that ruling. Some of the most divisive cases in the court's recent history fit that bill. It's for that reason that while we should all respect the Ginsburg rule, the idea that judges sitting before this panel should not weigh in on hypothetical cases that are likely to come before the court, nominees do nonetheless have a duty to be very clear about their judicial philosophy, their legal views, and their interpretive principles. The American people should not be asked to consent to any nominee who operates on principles that are obscure, confused, or concealed. That means that each of us has a job to do in these hearings. It is our job on the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask questions that help give the American people a clear view of the nominee. It's Judge Jackson's job to make her philosophy clear and well understood. And at the end of a constructive hearing, a nominee will have given us a good sense of how she thinks about the constitutional structure, what it does and doesn't do, and the key pillars that support it. Most fundamentally, the separation of powers and our carefully calibrated system of checks and balances. Throughout this process, we should all remember that a Supreme Court justice is not a lawmaker by another name. A Supreme Court Justice performs a crucial but limited function in our political system, namely to interpret and fairly apply the text of the law as written and as understood at the time it was adopted. A forthcoming nominee will make clear a commitment to uphold that purpose, which is the court's true purpose, not the purpose concocted for it by decades of political use, abuse, and overreach. A good nominee will show a commitment to the strict protection of enumerated rights, not the fabrication of unenumerated rights through contorted readings. An excellent nominee will offer a robust judicial philosophy that makes sound decisions more likely and more trusted by the public. Chairman, I look forward to hearing from Judge Jackson this coming week. DICK DURBIN: Thanks, Senator Sasse. Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Judge. Thank you for being here. Thank you to your family, and thank you to President Biden for his vision and wisdom and courage in nominating you. First, on a personal note for all of your extraordinary accomplishments and your immense distinction, you have shown two qualities that are rare among powerful accomplished people, kindness and humor.[*]RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: And you're obviously a good listener cause you're doing a lot of listening here today. As you've seen, we're likely to hear more than a few straw men today, worn talking points, imagined grievances. But this hearing really should be about you, not about us. Historic is a word often overused in this place where a lot of history  is made, but today seems truly to merit it. Certainly it is an inflection point, an inflection pinnacle, for our nation. The appointment of a Black woman to the United States Supreme Court, let's be very blunt, should have happened years ago. This day is a giant leap into the present for our country and for the court. The appointment of a Black woman to the court means that your service will make the court look more like America. Hopefully too, it will make the court think more like America. We will never know in detail all of the challenges and obstacles that you've overcome to be here today, but we know for sure that you will bring an important perspective, in fact a unique perspective, to a court that deeply needs it. Representation matters for the legitimacy and credibility of our judicial system. Judges are the face and voice of justice. People walking into your courtroom or any other in this country look to the human being, not just to the robes. Too often, our courts are isolated, seemingly sterile marble halls, lacking emotional intelligence or sensitivity to the impact they have on people, a fact that you clearly and dramatically understand. What really knocked me over in our meeting was the fact that you discussed your job as a judge in terms of the people who are affected by your rulings, the people whose lives are touched by the justice system, whether it's victims as criminal defendants or as people dealing with a personal or professional conflict. You will be the first public defender on the court. You understand our justice system uniquely through the eyes of people who couldn't afford a lawyer. They couldn't afford their own lawyer, and you advocated for them. You will also bring to the court extraordinary intellect and character as well as diverse personal and, indeed, professional experience. Your presence will ensure the court more fully and deeply understands the lives and experiences of everyday Americans. You grew up as the daughter of two public servants, public school teachers and administrators. You're the niece of uncles who have impressive law enforcement careers, including one as Miami's chief of police. And you also have family members who have struggled, as do every American. And you've advocated for defendants standing accused of serious crimes as well as sentencing defendants who have been convicted of such crimes. You are an immensely devoted parent who has achieved eye popping professional distinction. You've had a long career already as a distinguished jurist. In fact, you would bring more experience as a trial judge than any current justice on the Supreme Court. Now, I'd like to address directly the importance of your work as a public defender. I was a prosecutor and a law enforcement for a while, four years as US attorney and 20 years as Connecticut's attorney general. And as a prosecutor, I know the system works best when there are good lawyers on both sides. My worst nightmare as a prosecutor was a defendant representing himself. My second worst nightmare was an incompetent counsel representing a defendant, because I know effective representation on the other side means more likely an error free trial.I'd also like to address an issue that's been raised, first by Senator Durbin and then by Senator Graham. I'm likely to be followed by one or more colleagues who have raised allegations about your record that are simply unfounded in fact, and indeed irresponsible. They're unproven and unprovable. They're simply false.One of the first lessons that you learn as a prosecutor is never to promise a jury evidence that you don't have. There is simply no evidence to support these unfounded attacks. In fact, a commentary in the National Review  --  Review cited by Senator Durbin said about those allegations, they are meritless to the point of demagoguery.Importantly, your record as a jurist also reveals impartiality. You're a proven unifier and a consensus builder, someone who can build bridges among colleagues, even adversaries. Not surprisingly, you've been confirmed on a bipartisan basis three times by the Senate. You've received glowing endorsements from former judges who are stalwarts of the conservative movement. The court needs a bridge builder now more than ever. It has become more polarized, more politicized, more divided than at any point in our history, and it faces a crisis of legitimacy as a result. Dark money special interest groups have sought to radically reshape the court. Their recent selection of justices was, to a remarkable degree, outsourced to ideological groups with the express aim of remaking the court in the image of the far right conservative movement.This court has signaled that it will continue to overthrow well-established precedents after disingenuously promising us, members of this committee, that it would respect those precedent, and instead it threatens to adopt preferred policy views. I revere the United States Supreme Court. I clerked for a justice, myself, Harry Blackman. I've argued four times before the court. I'm deeply concerned that this court is careening toward a precipice that will gravely threaten its role in our history, that it is out of step with America and that it is losing the trust and respect of the American people that are essential to its authority.Trust in the United States Supreme Court is at a new law  --  a new low. The Supreme Court has no armies, no police force to enforce its decisions. Its authority depends on its credibility and the respect and trust of the American people. My hope is that you will help to restore that trust, that you will re-inspire the confidence of the American people in the court.I traveled, as did my colleague Senator Klobuchar, to Poland just a week ago. And I saw people fleeing bombs and destruction, people, mostly women and children, who wanted nothing more than the kinds of freedoms that we have in this country. We have an obligation to preserve them. And my hope is that your nomination will help us do so. Thank you. I look forward to your testimony. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. Senator Grassley just asked me what the plan is. The plan is to recognize two more senators and then  --  then take a 30 minute break for lunch. Is that okay, Judge? All right. We have Senator Hawley of Missouri. JOSH HAWLEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge, congratulations on your nomination. It's nice to see you again. Congratulations to all of your family. I know that this is a big moment for you and for them, and rightly so. I enjoyed our meeting a couple of weeks ago. You know, as I've said to folks who asked about it, one of the things I particularly appreciated about our meeting, besides how much time you gave me, was how candid and forthcoming you were, which I really respected. And I look forward to a candid conversation again in the days that come.And by the way, I'm admiring how you're sitting so stoically through all of this, all this senator talk, but I'm looking forward to visiting with you again. You did me the  --  the honor when we sat down of being very candid, and I hope I was candid with you. I've been candid since. I want to be candid with you today so you know exactly what it is I want to talk about and so you know exactly where my head is at. So, let me  --  let me say a few things that I'm concerned about, aspects of your record that  --  that trouble me. This'll come as no surprise. I've said it in public already, but I want to be, again, very candid in the interest of an open and honest discussion and specifics. So, here are, I hope in the next couple of days, some of the cases from your time on the  --  on the court  --  the district court, the federal district court, that I hope that we can talk about. Let me just run for you through a few of them so you know exactly which ones I mean. United States versus Hawkins; this was a child pornography case where the defendant distributed multiple images of child porn, possessed dozens more, including videos.[*]JOSH HAWLEY: The federal sentencing guidelines recommended a sentence of 97 to 121 months in prison. Prosecutors recommended 24 months in prison. Judge Jackson gave the defendant three months in prison. United States versus Chazen [PH], there it's -- that case, the defendant possessed 48 files of child pornography. The federal guidelines recommended 78 to 97 months in prison. The prosecutor recommended the same. Judge Jackson sentenced him to 28 months. United States versus Cooper. There, the defendant possessed dozens of images of child pornography and distributed -- I should say distributed dozens of images of child pornography, possessed over 600. The federal guidelines recommended 151 to 188 months in prison. That's a long time. The prosecutor recommended 72 months. Judge Jackson gave the defendant 60 months, which was the lowest sentence permitted by the law. United States versus Down [PH], that's a case where the defendant distributed 33 graphic images and videos of child sexual assault to an anonymous messaging app; unfortunately, a practice that's becoming more common. The federal guidelines recommended 70 to 87 months in prison. The prosecutor recommended 70 months in prison. Judge Jackson sentenced him to only 60 months. Again, that's the lowest level that was permitted by law In that case. United States versus Stewart, the defendant there distributed scores of images of children suffering sexual abuse. The guidelines recommended 97 to 121 months in prison. The prosecutor recommended 97 months in prison. Judge Jackson gave him 57 months. In the United States versus Sears [PH], the defendant distributed over 100 videos of child pornography. The guidelines recommended 97 to 121 months in prison. The prosecutor recommended 97 months in prison. Judge Jackson gave him 71 months. In the United States versus Savage, the defendant was convicted of traveling across state lines to engage in sexual intercourse with a child, and also possessed six separate thumb drives of child pornography. The guidelines recommended 46 to 57 months in prison. The prosecutor recommended 49 months in prison. Judge Jackson sentenced him to 37 months in prison. Now, those are seven cases that represent, as near as we can tell, all of Judge Jackson's cases dealing with child pornography from her time on the district court in which she had some discretion to hand down a sentence. There's some other cases in which the law  --  she didn't have any discretion. The law bound the sentence that she had to had to give. And what concerns me, and I've been very candid about this, is that in every case, in each of these seven, Judge Jackson handed down a lenient sentence that was below what the federal guidelines recommended and below what prosecutors requested. And so I think there's a lot to talk about there, and I look forward to talking about it. Now, I will note that some have said that the federal sentencing guidelines are too harsh on child sex crimes, especially child pornography. I've heard that argument a lot in recent days. The Chairman quoted someone earlier today who takes that point of view. I'll just be honest, I can't say that I agree with that. I mean, the amount of child pornography in circulation has absolutely exploded in recent years. Here's a New York Times report from 2019, and I'm quoting now. Last year, tech companies reported over 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused, more than double what they found the previous year. The report goes on to say this; 20 years ago, these online images were a problem. Ten years ago, they were an epidemic. Now, the crisis is at a breaking point. Unfortunately, it's even worse than that. Just last week, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported finding 85 million files of child pornography in 2021. And, of course, this committee has heard testimony from prosecutors and others who are grappling with the problem of how to get at this porn and those who distribute it, how to prosecute them and hold them accountable. Here's my point; I think it's difficult against this backdrop to argue that the sentencing guidelines are too harsh or outmoded, or that we should be somehow treating child porn offenders more leniently than the guidelines recommend. But I want to be clear about this, that those arguments that I've just been rehearsing, those who say that, those aren't  --  that's not what Judge Jackson has said. She hasn't had the chance yet to respond to this, and she deserves that chance. So others have made these arguments. I don't agree with them, but I think it's important we hear from Judge Jackson, and we'll have the chance to in coming days. And I think again the  --  the candor that Judge Jackson has shown previously, I look forward to, and she deserves the ability to speak for herself on this issue. So I will just say in closing, Mr. Chairman, some have asked why did I raise these questions ahead of the hearing? Why not wait until the hearing and spring them on Judge Jackson, as it were? And my answer to that is very simple. I'm not interested in trapping Judge Jackson. I'm not interested in trying to play gotcha. I'm interested in her answers, because I found in our time together that she was enormously thoughtful, enormously accomplished, and I suspect has a coherent view and explanation and set of thinking, way of thinking about this, that I look forward to hearing. And I think she deserves the chance to talk about it. I think the American people deserve the chance to hear her answers. So there are my concerns, Judge. There are the cases. I imagine there will be others that we can talk about on other subjects. But I'd like to talk about those, so you know exactly where I'm coming from. Thanks again for giving me the time a few weeks ago. Congratulations again. I look forward to finally hearing from you tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Hawley. Certainly, the judge deserves to be heard on that type of a charge. Senator Hirono. MAZIE K. HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Jackson, aloha to you and your family and all of your friends. I also note that there are members of the US House here to support you, as well as members of the public. So aloha to all of you. Congratulations, Judge Jackson, on all that you have accomplished throughout your life and career. I realize that a lot of your background and experiences have already been cited, but there are things that are worth repeating. So I'm going to repeat some of them. You were the national champion in speech and debate as a high schooler. You have undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard, each with honors; three clerkships in federal court, including one at the Supreme Court for Justice Breyer whom you have been nominated to replace. You have an accomplished career as a lawyer at the trial and appellate levels, both in private practice and as a public defender. Two stints at the US Sentencing Commission, including as vice chair; nine years as a federal judge, first in the DC District Court and currently in the DC Circuit Court. And now you've been nominated to the United States Supreme Court. I have enjoyed reviewing your record and getting to know you over the past few weeks. And now the American people will get to know you over the course of this week. Beyond your impressive credentials, here are a few other things I want the American people to know. You were born in Washington DC to two public school teachers. You moved to Miami, Florida, at a young age, so your dad could go to law school. And you were inspired to pursue a career in law by watching your dad study for his law classes at the kitchen table. You first considered attending Harvard, a thought that hadn't previously entered your mind, after attending a speech and debate competition on the Harvard campus during high school. And then you thought, this is possible. You've been confirmed three times by the Senate, all on a bipartisan basis. First, to the Sentencing Commission and later to be a judge on the DC District Court and the DC Circuit Court. You are the second generation in your family to get to go to college, and worked extremely hard to get to where you are today. You are a wife and mother of two children. Clearly, your life and your career have more than prepared you to serve on our nation's highest court, which is why it is no surprise that there is broad consensus across the political spectrum that you are an eminently qualified and fair person to serve on the circuit  --  on the Supreme Court. As former fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig, a George HW Bush appointee said, you are, quote, as highly credentialed and experienced in the law as any nominee in history, end quote. In history. That's over 200 years. Twenty-three attorneys general said, Judge Jackson is a highly qualified legal mind who has been at the forefront of the legal field for decades, and will serve our nation well as the first black woman to serve on the US Supreme Court. A group of law enforcement officers from across the country said, quote, "Jackson Bridges bridges a depth of character  --  brings a depth of character, public service, and judicial service that leads to but one conclusion. She is eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States," end quote.[*]MAZIE K. HIRONO: You are an accomplished jurist, having issued nearly 600 opinions that demonstrate a clear, evenhanded approach to the law. You have sided with workers, with employers, for and against the government, for prosecutors and for criminal defendants. Former DC Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee, summed it up best when you, Judge Jackson, quote, "Will adjudicate based on the facts and the law and not as a partisan," end quote. Having reviewed your record, I strongly agree with the statement. But you are not just extremely qualified to serve as a Supreme Court. Your nomination is, of course, an historic one. The Supreme Court has existed for over 233 years and of the 115 justices in the history of the Supreme Court, only five of them have been women, only two have been black, and not a single one has been a black woman. This is a court that has decided cases that have had sweeping effects on everyday life as my -- a number of my colleagues have pointed out, including decisions that have solidified rights for the LGBTQ plus community, decisions that have empowered women, that have strengthened unions and more. But this is also the same court that has throughout the course of history upheld slavery, Jim Crow laws, and the unlawful internment of Japanese Americans. For over 233 years the individual making decisions that have altered the course of this country have almost exclusively been white men. It's pretty remarkable when you consider the power that this court has and the historical lack of diversity of the people who exercise that power, the Justices. But instead of celebrating the long overdue diversity Just --  Judge Jackson would bring to the court, some of my Republican colleagues and public figures have attempted to undermine your qualifications through their pejorative use of the term affordiv  --  a  --  affirmative action. And they have implied you were solely nominated due to your race and not for other factors. Apparently some have even claimed that you need to show your LSAT scores to determine whether you are a top legal mind. This is incredibly offensive and condescending. Let me be clear, your nomination is about  --  not about filling a quota. It is about time. It's about time that we have a highly qualified, highly accomplished black woman on the Supreme Court. It's about time our highest court better reflects the country it serves. It's about time that black women and girls across the country can finally see themselves  --  who look like them sitting on the highest court making decisions that im  --  will impact their lives. And they will know that it is possible for them to do the same. One cannot overstate the importance of representation. Your experiences and your background as a trial judge, public defender, a mother, a black woman, and so much more provide you with a uniquely different perspective than any of the eight other justices on the court. Like your mentor Justice Breyer, I know you will encour  --  you will engage with the other justices both liberal and conservative  --  you are a consensus builder  --  to share their perspectives, challenge their views, and shape the court's direction for the better. With the personal and professional diversity you bring, you will expand the experience and knowledge of the Supreme Court and the decisions the court makes will be better as a result. Before I end, I also wanted to mention I was so glad to hear your reference Constance Baker Motley during your introductory press conference at the White House. Constance Baker Motley was an icon of the civil rights movement. As a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund she helped craft the argument in Brown v Board of Education that finally put an end to separate but equal. She was the first black woman to argue before the Supreme Court, ultimately arguing ten cases before the court and winning nine including the case that allowed James Meredith to enroll at the University of Mississippi. She became the first black woman appointed as a federal judge, serving on the Southern District of New York for 20 years. And in a world free from discrimination she may have been the first black woman to sit on the Supreme Court some 50 years ago. As you said at your press conference, you stand on Judge Motley's shoulders. I have no doubt there will be a generation of young girls who will stand on yours. I also have no doubt that you will respond forcefully to some of the allegations that have been lodged against you, Judge Jackson. I congratulate you and your family on this historic nomination. I look forward to hearing from you this week. Mahalo and aloha. DICK DURBIN: Thank you. Senator Hirono. Now we're going to break and return at 2:05 when you will hear this and we're back in business. The meantime, thank my colleagues and I particularly thank the judge for her patience.[*]DICK DURBIN: The Senate Judiciary Committee will resume. And next up is the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Cotton, for opening statement. TOM COTTON: I welcome Judge Jackson and her family and I congratulate her on her nomination. This an important occasion. The Biden administration is waging a war on the rule of law, the separation of powers and the Constitution. The lawlessness of the administration highlights the importance of judges who faithfully apply the law. To understand the ongoing power grab, let's consider President Biden's failed nominee to lead the Department of Justice's ATF. The man he nominated can only be described as a anti-gun zealot. Thanks to the courage of some of my Democratic colleagues, that nominee was withdrawn, but it's disturbing that the President was ever willing to nominate someone who planned to shred the Second Amendment and ban virtually every modern hunting rifle in America. Just a few weeks ago, the Biden administration tried to twist the authority of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a relatively obscure agency, designed to regulate things like ladder safety on construction sites, and use it as a weapon to force virtually every American to choose between getting vaccinated or losing their livelihood. Thankfully, the Supreme Court struck down that unlawful power grab. Or, look at the southern border where Joe Biden and his Secretary of Homeland Security steadfastly refused to enforce our laws. As a result, 2 million illegal aliens streamed across our borders just last year. And less than six months ago, the attorney general of the United States, himself a former judge, ordered that federal prosecutors, the FBI and even the National Security Division of the Department of Justice be mobilized against parents who dared question the entrenched teachers unions who are poisoning their children with racist vitriol known as critical race theory. As Justice Scalia was fond of saying, every banana republic has a Bill of Rights, but it's nothing more than a parchment barrier without free and fair elections, without separated powers, without the rule of law, and without an independent judiciary to uphold it all. Perhaps recognizing what Justice Scalia meant the progressive left is not just threatening the rights of Americans, but our very system of constitutional government. Those on the left, including some of my colleagues here in the Senate, including on this committee, want to pack the Supreme Court. I would hope that anyone nominated to the court would have no problem echoing the words of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer. Both of these liberal lions have said that expanding the Supreme Court to achieve favored legal and political outcomes is a dangerous idea and that the Court should have nine justices and no more. But for some, political outcomes on the court are exactly their goal. The Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, stood on the steps of the Supreme Court almost exactly two years ago and yelled at specific Justices quote, "You have unleashed the whirlwind and you will pay the price", and added, quote, "you won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions". End quote. The chief justice rightly condemned these words. Again, I hope any nominee to the Court would be comfortable condemning these words from Senator Schumer as well. The Supreme Court is not the only constitutional limit on power that the left would like to destroy. The associate attorney general of the United States has said that she believes that every single American, every single American and every single institution in this country are inherently racist. And the very concepts of the rule of law and equal justice for all are actually quote "code words"; that's what she said, "code words" for some kind of twisted secret racism. These threats to the rule of law are not merely theoretical. We are witnessing a breakdown of society. There are many Americans who no longer feel safe today. Parents are scared to walk down the streets that used to be free from crime. In 2020, anarchists, rioters, and left wing street militias raged across the country and murders increased at the fastest rate in history. And in the first year of the Biden administration, violent crime got even worse. It's no coincidence that this violence  --  violence came as localities and states pushed to defund the police and reduce the punishment for criminals. Career criminals are committing violent crimes and going free under the guise of a supposedly more equitable justice system. And liberal judges who have more sympathy for the victimizers than for the victims are a big part of the problem. The Biden administration is committed to be soft on crime policies like ending cash bail to create a catch and release system for violent criminals. Progressive Soros prosecutors who are supported by the Biden administration have nullified entire sections of law to destroy our criminal justice system from within. The consequences are obvious; skyrocketing violent crime, emboldened gangs, and drug overdoses reaching numbers never before seen in American history. If Judge Jackson is confirmed, her decisions will have a direct impact on the safety of the American people. So we're going to look at her past decisions and her statements because the best predictor of future performance is past performance. That brings us to today. We're asked to determine whether the President's nominee to the Supreme Court is able and willing to meet these vital challenges. I enjoyed meeting with Judge  --  Judge Jackson last week in my office. We had a good conversation, and over the next few days I'll have many more questions. Let's be clear about this. The confirmation hearing is not a test of how well nominees can filibuster or how many questions they can avoid answering. It's true that there is a tradition of avoiding any stances on how one might rule in specific cases, if confirmed, and there's good reason for that. But that's not a license to refuse to discuss one's views of the law, how one would go about conducting legal interpretation, or one's philosophy as a judge. Judge Jackson isn't nominated to be a district judge or a circuit judge this time around. So it is not enough to say that she will approach things with integrity and fairness and faithfully apply precedents set by higher courts. Just as you wouldn't hire a teacher who refused to say anything about their teaching philosophy, other than that they would look at the curriculum and appropriately teach the students, it's not enough to say only that one would look at the facts and arguments in the case and fairly apply the law. That wouldn't tell us anything about how one plans to do the job, how one interprets the law, how one understands our Constitution. It's no secret that I voted against Judge Jackson's nomination to the circuit court last year, but I want to give her the opportunity to show why I should vote for her this time. So I want to be clear about what would convince me to support any Supreme Court nominee. I'm looking for a Justice who will uphold the Constitution, not use it to invent new so-called rights. I'm looking for a Justice who understands that the Constitution means what it says and does not mean what it doesn't say. Someone who understands that is not up to nine unaccountable unelected politicians in black robes to decide some new evolving meaning of the Constitution based on public opinion polling or views of the legal elite. I'm looking for a Justice who realizes that a so-called living constitution really means that the Constitution is dead. Instead, we should have an enduring Constitution as Justice Scalia contended. I'm looking for a justice who understands that there is a process for updating the Constitution and that process is by amending the Constitution. I will not support anyone who seeks to rewrite the Constitution from the bench rather than through our constitutional amendment process. [*]TOM COTTON: I'm looking for a justice who understands that nobody is above the law and will not coddle criminals or put illegal aliens ahead of American citizens. Looking for a justice who will protect the right to life of innocent infants instead of caving to the abortion lobby, creating whole new swaths of law out of whole cloth. I'm looking for a justice who will make decisions based on the law, not based on their personal experiences or preferences, not on empathy, not on desired political outcomes, but on the law and the constitution. If Judge Jackson is confirmed, her job will be simple. Leave the legislating to Congress and to elected accountable officeholders in our states and our municipalities, zealously protect the separation of powers and don't overturn laws unless they violate the Constitution. I look forward to these hearings. Thank you very much. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Cotton. Senator Booker of New Jersey.CORY BOOKER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge, Your Honor. It's very good to see you. Forgive me. When you were in my office, you were focused on the hearings and a lot of the substance and had such great questions. I could not stop being just joyous that you were sitting in my office and I couldn't stop bringing up to you the historical nature of this. Forgive me, I grew up in a small black church where I was taught to make a joyous noise unto the Lord, and this is not a normal day for America. We have never had this moment before. And I just want to talk about the joy. I know tomorrow and the coming hearings, we're going to have tough hard questions. But please let me just acknowledge the fact that this is not normal. It's never happened before. The Senate is poised right now to break another bat barrier. We are on the precipice of shattering another ceiling, another glass ceiling. It's a sign that we as a country are continuing to rise to our collective share --  cherished highest ideals. I  --  I  -- I just feel this sense of overwhelming joy as I see you sitting there, as I see your family sitting behind you. You know the greatness of America is that these imperfect geniuses at our founding founded a nation different than any before in human history. It wasn't because we all prayed the same or looked the same. They put forth in a constitution the best hopes for humanity. And the story of America, I think is a testimony to this world of what diverse people can achieve. It's been said by so many of my colleagues about the fact that we have had 115 Supreme Court justices, and we shouldn't diminish the accomplishments of mostly these 108 white men. They were extraordinary patriots who helped shape this country. But now, we are seeing to the highest court in our land, a hopeful day like this that  --  that so many of the people, so much of the rich talent of our nation who could not scarcely ever dream of sitting on the Supreme Court. Now, we are showing that we will indeed go deep into the waters of our nation and pull forth the best talent. Extraordinary legal talent comes from all backgrounds. I know that in our nation, for the 200 plus years of our history, there have been extraordinarily talented black people, men and women, Muslim men and women, from the founding of our nation. We've seen extraordinary indigenous men and women all probably could have added to the greatness of our courts, but they were denied that opportunity. I believe we say these words justice for all, but there are many of people who feel those words have been diminished by the lack of representation, the lack of avenues for talented people to ascend to our courts. But fortunately, thanks to the sacrifices of all Americans, people on both sides of the political aisle, we have begun to see more and more diverse Americans slowly get on to our federal courts. My family celebrated that I was born in 1969, the year that President Johnson nominated Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to serve on the Supreme Court. It shook the wonderful foundations of our nations and he became a symbol to all of us, black and white, of what a Supreme Court justice can be. And then Ronald Reagan 1981 roughly 200 plus years since the founding of our nation put Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. That was not a normal moment. It was a moment to rejoice. And now, we've seen President Obama put Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic on the court. And what I'm seeing in this Congress, my colleagues and I doing is we are opening the doors of diverse talent to our federal courts in ways we've never seen before. Think about this. President Biden has nominated the first ever Article III Muslim judge to our federal courts. He nominated the first openly LGBTQ woman to serve on our federal court. He nominated Native American and Asian-American candidates who have appeared before this committee incredibly talented individuals worthy of their positions, now acting roles to the benefit of our whole nation. They herald the truth of who we are as a country, an inclusive multicultural nation that shows the world the promise of a true democracy. In all, over two thirds of the confirmed judges under the Biden administration have come from groups who historically have not been represented on our federal courts. So for this, those reasons and more today to me is a day of joy. I cannot tell you how happy I am. Today, we should rejoice because President Biden nominated someone that we've heard to be the 116th associate judge of the Supreme Court who is extraordinarily talented and who also happens to be a black woman. Something we've never seen before. Judge Jackson's nomination breaks an artificially confining mold of our past and opens up a more promising potential filled future for us all as Americans. It signals that this nation will draw more deeply from all of our talent and genius that will benefit all Americans. This is the America that most of our families speak of from all our diverse backgrounds, an America where anybody can achieve anything, not because of the color of their skin, but because of the content of their character. And God, I can't wait for America to find out more about your character. When the next generation behind us looks at the highest courts in the land, this ideal will be made more real and even just the faces of the nine. You bring this wealth of experience, that's exciting to me. You've seen so many parts of our legal system, but I just want to talk about your role as a public defender because that too is unprecedented. I have a friend that my  --  that just was at the prayer breakfast here in Congress, Bryan Stevenson. He has a saying. He says we have a justice system that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. I'm not sure if most Americans know that 80 percent of those who go before our nation's criminal courts can't afford an attorney. To this end, a public defender should be looked at as one of the most honorable roles within our judicial system, and yet we have never had a public defender or anyone who served as a public defender on our highest court, and it unfortunately is very lacking among all federal judges. You wrote Judge that the role of the public defender made you a better judge. You said it gave you a chance to quote help people in need and to promote core constitutional values. Well, the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel is guaranteed regardless of wealth and despite the nature of the accusations. I honor that more than you know as someone who started in legal clinics at Yale. I had my empathy expanded. I had my understanding of the struggles of my fellow Americans in ways that shaped my entire professional career. I love the fact that you have been a bridge builder in so many ways. You have the support of Republican appointed judges and Democratic appointed judges. Heck, you were confirmed by the Senate in a bipartisan manner three times. I love the fact that you have the support of civil rights lawyers and our largest police organizations like the FOP. It is a testimony to what this nation needs more of; people that will find ways not to accentuate the lines of divide, but try to find more ties that bind us together. Let me go one note more personal. Back to you sitting in my office. I can't tell you how before our meeting, how many people reached out to me with very emotional moments. You know, my mom's deltas, I heard from many linked sisters. I cannot tell you what it meant to me. So when you came to my office, rarely I was a little kind of nervous even. And  --  And then you started talking about your family and your parents. I want to tell your parents, you and I have something in common. We're both around the same age. Both of our parents graduated from HBCU's. My dad, Mr. Brown, Dr. Brown is also an eagle. He went to North Carolina Central just like you.[*]CORY BOOKER: And they came to DC. My mom worked in the DC public schools, Mr. Brown, just like you. And your story, the more you talked, Americans from all backgrounds know what it is to be underestimated and looked down upon when they told you you were too ambitious for wanting to go to Harvard. You were a mom that faced career challenges at your private law firm. How many women can relate to that? The more you spoke about your personal story, the more I know it is an American story that folks from all backgrounds can relate to, But there's something that really moved me. Behind you in your family is your daughter Layla. And when she was 11 years old -- I love this -- she wrote a letter to President Obama, urging him to nominate his -- her mother, you, to the United States Supreme Court. Wow. And in that letter, her recommendation put forward that you, Judge Jackson, would be, quote, a great Supreme Court Justice. I suspect after these proceedings, and please, God, after your confirmation to the Supreme Court, something new will happen in America; that that letter from your daughter will not be exceptional. Generations of little young girls and generations of little young boys, no matter who their parents are, will have the audacity to write the President of the United States, whether they're daughters of white parents or black parents or biracial parents, or Muslim and Jewish parents, Sikh or Hindu parents, we're going to see a new generation of children talking about their mamas, and daring to write to the President of the United States of America that my mom should be on the Supreme Court. Well, I want to tell your daughter right now, that that dream of hers is so close to being a reality. Some tough days ahead, but I think it can happen. And your grandparents' generation, literally this week back in 1965, when my parents were in Washington DC. And that week there was a man named Martin Luther King who began on this day a march from Selma to Montgomery. And when he finally made it on the 25th of March, he talked to people who were losing faith in America, that we can be who we say we are. And he says for those folks, how long will we have to wait? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, and it bends toward justice. Well, today, America is witnessing the literal bending of the arc and the conducting of one of the most sacred ideals of this country, justice for all. I think more people at the end of these hearings and after a Senate vote, more people will believe that we can be the nation we say we are when we put our hand on our heart. Indeed, I think you and your family are giving a lot more people faith that we will achieve a nation of liberty and justice for all. Thank you. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Kennedy of Louisiana. JOHN KENNEDY: Hello, Judge. If you are a lawyer or an American, I guess it doesn't get any bigger or better than this. Congratulations. In addition to honoring the wonderful state of Minnesota and unless you correct me, I am going to assume that you're  --  your purple attire is also meant to honor LSU in my state. And if I squint real hard, I might call it Marian blue, the colors of my Southern University in Louisiana. I want  --  I want to compliment you and the Biden White House for selecting Senator Doug Jones to advise you. Senator Jones knows the Senate and the Senate knows Senator Jones. And we know him to be quite the intellect. But more important, we know him to be a person of good judgment and goodwill. And I'm  --  I'm glad that you've been listening to him. I hope we will be able to use this hearing today to talk about, if not implicitly, at least implicitly, two subjects. The first is the legitimacy of the United States Supreme Court. Where does the court get its legitimacy? What can we do to enhance it? Judicial legitimacy is important. I don't need to tell you that. I'm rather fond of the Constitution. I know you are, too. When members of the United States Supreme Court interpret it, I want the American people to believe them. I want the American people to say, well, I may not agree, but the men and women who made that decision are intellectually honest and people of good faith. One of the primary roles of the United States Supreme Court is to uphold the rule of law. And sometimes justices have to uphold the rule of law when it's not popular. Sometimes justices have to uphold the rule of law when it's not popular with the majority of Americans. And boy, that's tough. It's also important. Sometimes, not generally but sometimes the majority can mean that just all the fools are on the same side, and that's what the court's there for. And I'm rather fond of the Bill of Rights, too, and I know you are as well. I've never believed that the Bill of Rights was there for the  --  for the high school quarterback or the prom queen. They're covered by it, but the Bill of Rights is there to protect the right to  --  of people who don't see the world exactly like everybody else or who don't look exactly like everybody else. Now, unfortunately through history, we have had people, some well-intentioned, who tried to delegitimize the Supreme Court. We had a president way back when who tried to impeach a Supreme Court Justice. We had another president Who wanted to pack the court. I remember the Impeach Earl Warren signs down in the Warren Court. And most of the people who want to delegitimize the Supreme Court believe that the  --  unlike our founders, in my judgment  -- believe that  --  that members of the Supreme Court ought to be and are politicians in robes. They believe that the United States Supreme Court ought to be a mini Congress. They believe that the law is not the law. The law is supposed to just be politics practiced in a different way, and they believe in court packing, and they're wrong. Number two, I hope today that we can use this as an opportunity to talk about, if not explicitly, at least implicitly  --  that's what I'm going to try to do  --  the appropriate balance between representative government and declarative government. Now, in representative government, as you well know, people through their elected representatives make policy. In declarative government, policy is made by the unelected, the administrative state, and the federal judiciary. Now, both are important. Both are important. I'm not saying this is a zero sum game or either/or. But what's just as important is we have the appropriate balance between representative government and what I'll call declarative government.[*]JOHN KENNEDY: I mean, we have an administrative state. Did any of us ever think it would get this big? Is that healthy? We need to ask ourselves that. Is it really healthy to arrive at a circumstance where the administrative state passes 35 laws a year to our one? Is it really healthy to have an administrative state that makes its own laws, interprets to its own laws, and enforces its own laws before courts with respect to which the administrative state appoints the judges. I think that's a fair question to ask. In terms of -- with respect to -- to --  to declarative government in the Supreme Court and  --  and the federal judiciary, Federal judges have enormous power. They have to. But they do, they have enormous power. You're appointed for life. You can't be unelected. Your salary can't even be reduced. And you have to have that power. Judicial power is important. So is judicial restraint. I believe that the appropriate role of the federal judiciary is the following. Federal judges don't make law. They don't tell us what the law ought to be. They tell us what the law is. Now, I said primarily because of course sometimes federal judges make law, I mean make the law of the case; you decide a case. You have to tell us what reasonable means in terms of searches and seizures. You have to help us define restraint of trade after we pass a statute. So of course, judges make law, but I'm talking about  --  you  --  about the  --  the proper balance. I'll leave you with these last thoughts. And then I'll yield back my time. I want you to hear the words of one of  --  and what my in my opinion is  --  is  --  is one of our most distinguished Supreme Court Justices. I'm going to read it  --  read his words. The American people love democracy. And the American people are not fools. The people know their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school, maybe better. Value judgments after all should be voted on, not dictated. I look forward, Judge, to getting to know you better. And congratulations, mom and Dad. DICK DURBIN: Thanks. Senator Kennedy. Senator Padilla. ALEX PADILLA: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Judge Jackson, welcome back to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now the last time you were before us, just less than a year ago, I recall that you mentioned that every once in a while you make it a point to walk a few blocks from your courthouse to the National Archives. As we all know, the National Archives is where the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are housed. You shared that you go there and reflect on the momentousness of the office that you hold. And it's a fitting place, these archives, to be reminded of our nation's highest ideals, our pursuit of a union that is more fair, that is more free, and that is striving to be more perfect. It's also place to see how for two and a half centuries our democracy has remained a work in progress. And that it's incumbent upon all of us, yes, as a nation, but each of us as individuals, to continue making that progress. Of the men who wrote our founding documents could never have imagined that you would one day be here. A former public defender, a proud graduate of a public high school, a working mom, and, yes, the first black woman nominated to serve on the nation's highest court. Colleagues, our founding fathers also could never have imagined that the Senators sitting before Judge Jackson would include the first women to represent California, Hawaii, and Tennessee, the first Jewish man to represent Georgia, the first Hispanic man to represent Texas, the first black man to represent New Jersey, nor could they have imagined that the list would include me. I'm here as a proud son of immigrants from Mexico who came to this country with little formal education, but with big dreams and a tremendous work ethic. And it's because of the decades of hard work and sacrifice by Santos and Lupe Padilla, my dad as a short order cook, my mom as a housekeeper that I have enjoyed tremendous opportunities in my life, and that includes the honor of representing the state of California and the United States Senate and of being the first Latino to do so. So like so many of us in this room, I'm blessed to live the American dream. Now looking around, you can see that the strides that our democracy has made towards strengthening our institutions by including more voices and more perspectives. Judge Jackson, if you're confirmed, we'll take another step towards making our government better reflect the America that it serves, towards making the promise of America more real. And we know that progress doesn't come easily. Breaking barriers and being the first means not just significant opportunity, but tremendous responsibility. But Judge Jackson, I also know that you're equipped with a tremendous record of experience and accomplishment and you are ready to blaze this trail; a trail that your grandparents may have found unfathomable, but one that your daughters, and my sons, and future generations will now see as a natural part of the American story. Judge Jackson, even before your next opinion or dissent, your appearance before us today already begins a new chapter in our nation's history. And I can say for certain that by the end of these hearings, those watching across the country will know of your outstanding qualifications, your experience, and your accomplishments, which bear repeating over and over again. A public education including graduating from Miami Palmetto High School, I see that smile, followed by degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, clerkships at the federal district court, the Federal Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court, two years as a federal public defender, two years as a staff member of the United States Sentencing Commission, and four years as its vice chair. You've been confirmed by this Senate, not once, not twice, three times, each on a bipartisan basis, including two lifetime judicial appointments. And you bring nearly a decade of judicial experience, which by the way is more than the combined total of four of the currently sitting Justices at the time they were nominated. So yes, you are clearly more than qualified to serve as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. And yes, you bring a wealth of other important experiences and perspectives to the court, including as a working mother and as a black woman. Now in these hearings, I look forward to speaking further about your background, your experiences, both on and off the bench, and your approach to the law. But based on our conversations already and my review of your record, I believe you have the expertise, the insight, and the heart to elevate the weighty the deliberations of the Supreme Court. Now every year the Supreme Court decides dozens of cases that shape the fundamental rights and lives of the American people. Only a small percentage of those cases will ever be highlighted in history books, make the front page of newspapers, or go viral on social media, but the choices of the Supreme Court will certainly shape the future of labor rights, voting rights, women's rights, criminal justice, immigration, technology, environmental protection, and so much more.[*]ALEX PADILLA: I also want to be clear about something important If you're confirmed, I don't expect to agree with every detail of every decision that you make. That's not my test. That is not our test. Our job on this committee is to make sure that the next justice will honor the rule of law and the principle of equal justice for all. We must ensure that the next justice will help the Supreme Court live up to its responsibility to the American people. And yes, America is watching. America is watching these hearings to see what the future holds, not just for themselves but for the court as well. Judge Jackson, like you, I believe in the greatness and the promise of this nation. I believe that we can continue building on our dream of a more perfect union. And that includes building a government that better reflects and represents the people that it serves. It's a dream that we've spent two and a half centuries struggling to realize. And while this hearing may not be the last step on that journey, it is a momentous step forward indeed. Judge Jackson, You're an outstanding nominee for our nation's highest court, and I thank you for your service and I thank you for sharing your faith in America's promise of faith that is stronger because you know how far our nation has come. And Mr. Chair, before closing and with your indulgence, I'd like to share a few words in Spanish on the importance of this nomination. [Untranslated] Judge Jackson, I look forward to your testimony over the next few days and I thank you, Mr. Chairman. DICK DURBIN: Muchas gracias, Senator Padilla. Senator Tillis of North Carolina. THOM TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. It's a real honor to now participate in my fourth Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process. And Judge Jackson, congratulations on your nomination. I do feel like you and your family have every reason to be very proud and your daughter apparently has pretty weighty letter writing skills. When we met together, I wanted to thank you for the time that we spent together. I asked about your family. You beamed with pride. I can understand why you have parents, brothers  --  I'm sorry, siblings, family members who are public servants themselves, and now you've gone on to do that, continue that legacy with your power  --  in your public defender role and as a judge. You should be very proud of that. And we should also recognize the historic nature of this event, the first African-American female to be put forth for confirmation for the Supreme Court as quite extraordinary. I also want to recognize that when we had the meeting in my office, I ask you why on earth are you doing this? Because this week is not going to be particularly fun every moment of it? Why  --  why on earth are you doing this? I mean, you're brilliant, you're well-educated, you're studied in the law. There are so many other things that you could do. And you said that it really is the pinnacle of your professiona and that I guess in many respects, this is a realization of a dream of yours. But I also think that it's probably putting within reach. For many young boys and girls, young men and women, the reality that they too someday could be here before the Senate being considered for confirmation to the highest court in the land. So you're not only fulfilling your dreams, you're making the dreams of others appear to be within reach. I think as we go through this hearing this week, we're also going to get an opportunity to see the content of your character demonstrated. I for one think you have a strong track record of ethical values, honesty, integrity, respecting others and endeavoring to be fair, just, and compassionate. You know, confirming a Supreme Court justice is one of the most important responsibilities I think I have as a US Senator. The outcome of our decision will impact millions of lives and the very structure in the future of our constitutional republic. Supreme Court justices must find answers to some of the most pressing, constitutional and legal questions of our time. They're confronted with complex questions. Many of them don't have good answers or at least easy ones. That's why it's critical whenever a can of  --  we confirm a Supreme Court justice. We understand the nominee's judicial philosophy and then reconcile it with our conception of the best mindset to bring to the bench. In my opinion, our justices job is to interpret the text and words of the Constitution as written and give them their original, meaning. I reject the notion that the Constitution is a living evolutionary document that changes based on the impulses of five unelected justices. A good judge must understand that his or her job isn't to legislate from the bench and read in their preferred policy outcomes into statute. If the words of the statute are clear, a good judge will reach a decision based on those words, and those words alone, even if it creates an outcome, they may disagree with personally. In other words, in the words of Chief Judge  --  Chief Justice Roberts, a good justice is one  --  has one job calling balls and strikes; nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes that leads to rulings that Republicans like and Democrats hate, other times it leads to rulings that Democrats like and Republicans hate, and sometimes it leads to rulings that everybody hates. But that's okay. That's really your job as a Supreme Court justice. I had the opportunity to meet Judge Jackson, I said earlier, and I also want to thank you for your indulgence. I may have done my interviews a little bit differently than other ones. I asked some questions and then I had all my staff ask a number of questions. I was quite impressed with how engaged you were with some of the former members of the other Judiciary committee and other staff. And I even scared one person who was just on the job a week and a half. I said, you've got a question for the Supreme Court, justice And he had a question. It was a good question, and you were very indulgent in your answer. I just thought you were honest and forthcoming. I want you to know that I've said that in the press. I think that you have the right temperament just based on how I've seen you react to the questions that are not the questions, but the statements today and also appreciate how your unique perspective, your upbringing, your family, and your experience as a former public defender have shaped your views. As I noted during your confirmation in the Supreme Court or to the circuit court, I do have some additional questions and concerns that I want to ask about to kind of waved about what we've together or reconcile my conception of the  --  the right mindset for a judge going to the Supreme Court. I'm concerned and we'll look into questions over the next couple of days And I will be here for the majority of the hearing to hear  --  to kind of put together the foundation that I need to make ultimately make a decision on your confirmation. So as I proceed with the hearing this week, I'll be at attendance most of the time except for breaks, and I'll focus on better understanding your writings. I'm in the middle of your thesis right now, I should be finished by tomorrow morning your political activities and opinions with the goal of determining your philosophy and whether or not it fits with my conception of the right philosophy for somebody that I would vote to confirm. I'll listen thoroughly. I'll keep an open mind as I do with every nominee before this committee. But at the end of the week, I ultimately have to conclude whether or not I'm comfortable with putting someone in a lifetime position, and whether that person is likely to have the kind of philosophy that I want. I've told Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Barrett that I hope and I expected that they would take opinions that would make me mad, and that's okay. I just want to know that they do it for the right reason. I don't want an activist at either end of the spectrum, although I think some people, some folks are okay with one end of the spectrum, not the other. If we're talking about preserving the integrity of the court, there's no place on the Supreme Court for judicial activism. And the best thing that we can do here is make sure that we have justices that are going to be stewards of the Constitution, respectful of the measures that we pass out of here, and call those balls and strikes. So I look forward to the hearing tomorrow. You're going to get a lot of questions asked. I do thank all of my colleagues in advance for being respectful, thoughtful and  --  and open minded And I look forward to hearing your opening statement. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Tillis. Senator Ossoff, Georgia. [*]JON OSSOFF: Thank you, Mr. Chairman Ranking Member Grassley. Judge Jackson, good afternoon. Good afternoon -- and to your family, congratulations to your family. Congratulations to you for your nomination, and welcome back to the Judiciary Committee. I engage in these proceedings with deep respect for the responsibility that the Senate has to advise and consent on the lifetime appointment of a Supreme Court Justice, who would be responsible for interpreting and applying constitutional and statutory law in the most complex and contested and nationally significant cases. The Constitution was a groundbreaking document when written, and still by today's standards as amended, considering the tyranny that prevails in much of the world. Its guarantees of liberty and privacy and due process are exceptional as a governing document. Often in our history, it has fallen to the court through its decisions to ensure the enforcement of those guarantees. Yet, our Constitution's guarantees of individual rights and equal protection under the law remain too often and for too many unfulfilled. For any colleagues who doubt this, I remind them of Ahmaud Arbery's murder in Glynn County, Georgia, just two years ago when a young black man was shot dead in cold blood on camera in the street, and the local authorities buried the case and looked the other way. Only a massive civil rights mobilization pressured state and eventually federal prosecutors to act. For any colleagues who doubt that those promises remain unfulfilled to too many, I remind them that in my state, you can predict how long someone must wait to vote by where they live and the color of their skin. In practice, the promises made in the plain text of our Constitution are still too often broken for too many of our fellow Americans. And so the court remains essential to that national process of becoming in real life what America is in text. Today's hearing, Judge Jackson, is evidence that this process continues. And above all, a testament to you personally that in a nation still striving to transcend the legacies of slavery and segregation and institutionalized racism, through your brilliance and resilience and hard work you have already rendered a great service to the nation as a federal judge. And as a black woman, you have overcome deeply rooted obstacles to earn nomination to our nation's highest court for the first time in history. Alongside our Constitution's exceptional guarantees of individual rights and equal protection is its exceptional system of checks and balances. Restraints on political power imposed by the diffusion of authority across three co-equal branches, between federal and state governments, with a president and a federal legislature directly accountable to voters and an independent federal judiciary whose judges must be confirmed by elected senators. This constitutional system has endured and developed for nearly a quarter of a millennium. It is resilient. But democracy remains the exception, not the norm, in history and around the world, and we cannot take the survival of our republic for granted. And so I look forward to engaging with you, Judge Jackson, to discuss your perspective on the separation of powers and the resilience of our Constitution when threatened by political actors who would ignore the rule of law or seek to seize power by illegal or extraordinary means. Among the court's most challenging tasks are to grapple with unsettled law when the stakes are highest or even existential for individuals and for the country, and to apply the Constitution faithfully over the long arc of history, as the world changes in profound ways and the text of faithful constitutional interpretation meets new facts, new contexts, and new technologies. Judge Jackson, should you be confirmed, you may serve as a Supreme Court Justice well into the middle of this century. You will rule on cases whose contours and complexity we cannot yet imagine. And so among several areas of interest, I look forward to learning how you will consider protections against unreasonable search and seizure in an age of ubiquitous surveillance. How you might approach disputes over war powers; where law remains unsettled between executive and legislative claims; how you will approach questions pertaining to freedoms of speech and of the press. And seek that confirmation that you will apply the law faithfully without regard for your own opinions, as my review of your extensive work to date demonstrates that I believe you will. This constitutional process of advice and consent is vital to the integrity and legitimacy of the court. And Judge Jackson, on behalf of my constituents in Georgia, I look forward to engaging in this process with you and my colleagues. Mr. Chairman, I yield. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Ossoff. Senator Blackburn of Tennessee. MARSHA BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Jackson, welcome. You are indeed to be congratulated and your entire family with you, and thank you for your time to visit. I appreciated so much that. And to your daughters, her best job is being Mama. She likes that one. And  --  but we've talked today a little bit about the momentous occasion that this is and bringing you forward, and indeed it is. Because unlike any other federal office, this is a lifetime appointment. And the decisions that you're going to make are going to impact rights and freedoms of every single American citizen. And, you know, President Biden thinks you're the right person for the job, but it doesn't end there. We do have that role of advice and consent, and it is up to us to carry that job out. So, as you have heard repeatedly, this is going to be a fair and very thorough and very respectful hearing. And we're going to work through this process with some tough questions, but do it in a manner the respect that you deserve. And we've talked some today about the treatment of Justice Thomas and Justice Kavanaugh. Justice Barrett, who was questioned about her faith and whether that made her suitable for the court. And I know your faith is important to you. We've also talked some about Janice Rogers Brown and the treatment that she endured here. So we are going to be pleased to move forward and focus on the issues that the American people want to focus on, because they want to know about you and how you're going to approach your job; and the decisions that you have made in the past, what you've written, what you have said. And I've got a few areas that I'm going to want to delve a little bit further with you, and we touched on some of these as we talked. Right now, when I talk to Tennesseans, one of the most important things that they bring up is the issue of parental rights, and wanting to be able to rear their children as they see fit. And moms and dads are very concerned about this progressive agenda that is being pushed in some of our public schools. Educators are allowing biological males to steal opportunities from female athletes in the name of progressivism. Just last week, an entire generation of young girls watched as those charged with protecting them allowed a biological male to compete and beat a biological woman at the highest level of collegiate sports. Some girls have been forced to share locker rooms with biological males. Rather than defending our girls, those in power are teaching them that their voices don't matter. They're being treated like second-class citizens, and Americans need a Supreme Court Justice who will protect our children and will defend parents' constitutional right to decide what is best for their own kids. And here we need a little clarity. At a time when these parental rights appear to be under assault by the radical left, your public comments about  --  and I'm going to quote you  --  the transformative power of progressive education, end quote. These are deeply concerning.[*]MARSHA BLACKBURN: You serve on the board of a school that teaches kindergartners, five-year old children that they can choose their gender and teaches them about so-called white privilege. This school has hosted an organization called Woke Kindergarten and pushes an anti-racist education program for white families. Your public endorsement of this type progressive indoctrination of our children causes one great concern when it comes to how you may rule on cases involving parental rights. Parents also know that it's only a matter of time before we have the next pandemic, and they're concerned about more mask mandates or lockdowns from unelected bureaucrats that would harm their children's mental health and stunt their development. The American people want a Supreme Court justice who will protect their family's freedoms, not allow government overreach into private family decisions. Now, moms that I'm speaking with raise the issue of crime, and you've consistently called for greater freedom for hardened criminals. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, you advocated an agenda quote for each and every criminal defendant in the DC Department of Corrections Custody should be released. That would have been 1,500 criminals back on the street If you had had your way. And you used the COVID-19 pandemic as justification to release a fentanyl drug dealer, a bank robber addicted to heroin and a convict who murdered a US marshal into our communities, but your efforts to protect convicts began long before the pandemic. You used your time and talent not to serve our nation's veterans or other vulnerable groups, but to provide free legal services to help terrorists get out of Gitmo and go back to the fight. You also have a consistent pattern of giving child porn offenders lighter sentences. On average, you sentence child porn defendants to over five years below the minimum sentence recommended by the sentencing guidelines. And you have stated publicly that it is a mistake to assume that child pornography offenders are pedophiles. Your philosophy, it appears is backward on these issues; restrictions on children and families and freedom for criminals. In fact, your philosophy or lack thereof may be the root of the problem here. I was concerned during our conversation earlier this month when you told me that you really didn't have a judicial philosophy. The American people deserve a Supreme Court justice with a documented commitment to the text of the Constitution and the rule of law, not a judicial activist who will attempt to make policy from the bench. Without a judicial philosophy, a judge is legally adrift and will be inclined to consider policy rather than law. You once wrote that every judge has and I quote personal hidden agendas end quote, then influence how they decide cases. So I can only wonder what's your hidden agenda. Is it to let violent criminals cop killers and child predators back to the streets? Is it to restrict parental rights and expand government's reach into our schools and our private family decisions? Is it to support the radical left attempt to pack the Supreme Court? You have praised the 1619 Project, which argues the US is a fundamentally racist country and you have made clear that you believe judges must consider critical race theory when deciding how to sentence criminal defendants. Is it your personal hidden agenda to incorporate critical race theory into our legal system? These are answers that the American people need to know. So we are going to look at past statements and decisions and seek clarification from this committee before we make our decisions. So let me close again by congratulating you on your impressive career and your nomination to the nation's highest court. Regardless of the outcome of the confirmation process, you and your family should be incredibly proud of all that you have achieved. Your story is a wonderful example of the American Dream fulfilled. You were able to sit here today because you were reared and built your career in a free country whose laws protect equal justice and opportunity for all. To ensure that future generations can expect the same blessings and opportunities you receive, we need justices who will be dedicated to justice and the rule of law. Our questions to you over the coming days are going to be tough, but they're tough by necessity because it is our duty to discern, determine whether you will first and foremost uphold the Constitution and our nation's founding principles. Thank you so much for joining us. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Senator Blackburn, All committee members have now completed their opening statements. At this point in time, we're going to have a little shuffle of the logistics. I'll ask that the two introducers please come forward to the witness table. Judge Jackson, you can take a brief respite from the glare of the spotlight. We're fortunate today to have two distinguished guests introducing Judge Jackson. We will hear from Judge Thomas Griffith, who served as a judge on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the district DC Circuit from 2005 to 2020 and Professor Lisa Fairfax, who serves as a Presidential professor and co-director of the Institute for Law and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, Carrie Law School. Judge Griffith, we will start with you Make sure your microphone is turned on. There's a red button. THOMAS B. GRIFFITH: How's that? DICK DURBIN: It's been a while since you've been here. Okay. THOMAS B. GRIFFITH: Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I come here today as a retired federal appeals court judge with 15 years of experience on the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I come here as a jurist appointed by Republican President, George W Bush. And I come here as someone who understands that there are few greater responsibilities under the Constitution than serving as a justice on the United States Supreme Court. It takes a jurist of high character, keen intellect, deep legal knowledge and broad experience to ensure that the judiciary plays its unique role under the Constitution to uphold the rule of law impartially and not to be in the words of Justice Stephen Breyer, partisans in robes. Today I have the high honor to introduce Judge Gitanjali Brown Jackson, a jurist who has all of those qualities. When President Biden introduced her to the nation a little over three weeks ago, the American people caught their first glimpse of Judge Jackson's character. You may recall that she began her remarks with an expression of her faith in God and her gratitude for this nation, which she rightly observed is the greatest beacon of hope and democracy the world has ever known. I first met Judge Jackson in 2013 after the Senate had confirmed her nomination to the federal district court as a trial judge. Eight years later, she joined the DC Circuit as an appellate judge after another Senate confirmation. I've had many opportunities to review  --  to review her work and observe her work over the years as a judge, and on several occasions, I reviewed her decisions on appeal. Although we did not always agree on the outcome, the law required, I respected her diligent and careful approach, her deep understanding and her collegial manner, Indispensable traits for success as a justice on the Supreme Court. About her collegial manner, that important feature of the justices work is often overlooked. Although appointed by different Presidents, the justices have genuine fondness and respect for one another. We saw some of that in their expressions of admiration and love for Justice Breyer when he announced his retirement. The civil manner in which the justices debate the large and vexing issues before them is vital not only to the success of the Supreme Court, but to the success of our nation. The Constitution requires that of all of us. It goes without saying that civility of debate and respect for the differing views of others are sorely lacking from our public life. Judge Jackson's life has modeled these qualities. Perhaps most important, Judge Jackson is an independent jurist who adjudicates based on the facts and the law and not as a partisan.[*]THOMAS B. GRIFFITH: Time and again, she has demonstrated that impartiality on the bench. Sometimes ruling in favor of the government, sometimes ruling against the government; sometimes ruling in favor of the individual, sometimes ruling in favor of the corporation. Her rule is simple: follow the law. Now, some think it noteworthy that a former judge appointed by a Republican President would enthusiastically endorse a nomination to the Supreme Court by a Democratic President. That reaction is a measure of the dangerous hyper-partisanship that has seeped into every nook and cranny of our nation's life, and against which the framers of the Constitution warned us. There should be nothing unusual about my support for a highly-qualified nominee who has demonstrated through her life's work her commitment to the rule of law and an impartial judiciary. My formal -- former colleagues in the federal judiciary, Michael Luttig, Michael Chertoff, David Levy and Andrew Guilford, each appointed by Republican Presidents and all highly-respected judicial conservatives, have also voiced their strong support for Judge Jackson's confirmation. There was a time not so long ago when bipartisan support of the President's nomination of a highly-qualified jurist was regular order. Antonin Scalia was confirmed by the Senate 98 to nothing; Ruth Bader Ginsburg by a vote of 96 to 3. The rule of law is a fragile possibility in the best of times. Today, it is literally under attack in Ukraine and is threatened around the world and in our own country by autocrats and their sympathizers who give lip service to the rule of law, but then work to undermine it at every turn. As Justice Scalia taught us so well for so long, an indispensable --  indispensable feature of the Republic the Constitution created is an independent judiciary of judges who have taken an oath not to a president or a party, but to the American people and to God, that they will be impartial. Judge Ketanji Jackson Brown has demonstrated her unwavering commitment to that oath. I applaud this exceptional nomination, which I encourage the Senate to confirm. Thank you. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Judge. Professor Lisa Fairfax. LISA M. FAIRFAX: Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, and members of the Senate Judiciary. My name is Lisa Fairfax. I am a Presidential Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law and Co-Creator of its Institute for Law and Economics. Prior to my academic career, I worked at corporate and securities law at a large law firm. But before that, I was roommate and a very dear friend at Harvard College and Harvard Law School of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who I am so very honored to introduce to you today and to the American people. Ketanji and I met during our first days of college nearly 35 years ago, Those first moments when you wonder if you belong, she's the friend that made sure we all did. A woman of deep faith in God and unyielding love for family, Katanga defines friendship. She's the friend you're immediately drawn to for their outgoing and friendly nature. As our circle of friends grew, she's the one who became the rock for us all. Even though we are the same age, she is the role model who makes you believe in what she said: You can do it, and here's how. And she showed us how by the power of her example of hard work, preparation, and excellence that transforms the seemingly impossible into the achievable. Together, we poured our souls into our studies, graduating college with honors, and then doing it all over again when we enrolled and graduated law school with honors. We became sisters, and saw each other's families as our own. We both met our husbands when we were students, and we were there for each other as we walked down the aisles, started our legal careers, and eventually our lives as working mothers. My husband Roger Fairfax, now Dean of America University's Washington College of Law, has described Ketanji's impeccable credentials that's distinguished her at every level of her professional career. He also knows her as one of our children's most favorite people in the world. Our college roommate Nina Simmons, a top corporate lawyer, has described Ketanji's unwavering work ethic. She puts her head down and gets it done, even and perhaps especially when no one is watching. Our other college roommate Antoinette Coakley, a distinguished business law professor, has described Ketanji as a coalition builder. We knew early on that she could be anything she chose to be, but also that she seemed destined to be a judge, because of her ability to see all sides and render fair and levelheaded decisions. But our tight-knit group of girlfriends also knows that there's so much more to Ketanji beyond her brilliant mind. There's her wonderful sense of humor, her gift of storytelling, her heart of gold that always shows up. From the first call you make for advice about your career to the first knock you hear on the door after learning you're diagnosed with cancer, you never have to ask. She is always there. Above all, Ketanji is humble enough not to pretend she knows how to have it all, but she does know how to give it her all. And what she gives to her family, her friends, she also gives to the law and to this country. A testament of her character is all the people of different backgrounds and beliefs who understand that essence of Ketanji. We've seen that in her endorsements from bipartisan colleagues from the bench and the bar, and from both civil rights leaders and members of law enforcement. And we will see it in the history she will make. I know she is honored and humbled by the significance of this moment, not for what it means for her, but what it means for our amazing country. Confirmation of the idea that America is a place in which all of us can feel a sense of belonging and all of us can reach our fullest potential. While challenging, I would summarize nearly 35 years of friendship in this way by highlighting Ketanji's faith in God and country, her intellectual brilliance, her goodness and grace, and a work ethic that makes her perfectly suited for the serious task of serving on the Supreme Court. It is with tremendous pride, love, and gratitude for her willingness to serve that I introduce to you my dear friend and an exemplar of the best of America's promise, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Thank you. DICK DURBIN: Thank you both. Professor Fairfax and Judge Griffith, I'm sure that Judge Jackson and her family deeply appreciate your being here today and your kind words. I want to add to the list of introducers, the man sitting behind you, Senator Doug Jones, who has introduced Judge Jackson to many of us, not for the first time, maybe reintroduced it. But, Doug, thank you for serving in this cause and for helping the President and Judge Jackson. Thank you all three for being with us today. We are now going to move to the next phase of the program, and that is to hear from Judge Jackson. So if we could set up a table. Before you sit down, Judge, I'm going to ask you to take the oath, so  -- please raise your right hand. Do you affirm that the testimony you're about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God. KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: I do. DICK DURBIN: Let the record reflect that the judge has answered in the affirmative. And having met that requirement, you may now proceed with your remarks. KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, and distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee. Thank you for convening this hearing and for considering my nomination as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. I am humbled and honored to be here, and I am also truly grateful for the generous introductions that my former judicial colleague, Judge Tom Griffith, and my close friend, Professor Lisa Fairfax, have so graciously provided. I'm also very thankful for the confidence that President Biden has placed in me, and for the kindness that he and the First Lady and the Vice President and the Second Gentleman have extended to me and my family. Today will be the fourth time that I've had the honor of appearing before this committee to be considered for confirmation.[*]KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: Over the past three weeks, I have also had the honor of meeting each  member of this committee separately and I've met with 45 Senators in total. Your careful attention to my nomination demonstrates your dedication to the crucial role that the Senate plays in this constitutional process, and I thank you. And while I'm on the subject of gratitude, I must also pause to reaffirm my thanks to God for it is faith that sustains me at this moment. Even prior to today, I can honestly say that my life has been blessed beyond measure. The first of my many blessings is the fact that I was born in this great nation. A little over 50 years ago in September of 1970, Congress had enacted two civil rights acts in the decade before, and like so many who had experienced lawful racial segregation firsthand, my parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown left their hometown of Miami, Florida and moved to Washington, DC to experience new freedom. When I was born here in Washington, my parents were public schoolteachers, and to express both pride in their heritage and hope for the future, they gave me an African name, Ketanji Onyeka, which they were told means lovely one. My parents taught me that unlike the many barriers that they had had to face growing up, my path was clearer so that if I worked hard and I believed in myself, in America, I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be. Like so many families in this country, they worked long hours and sacrificed to provide their children every opportunity to reach their God given potential. My parents have been married for almost 54 years and they're here with me today. I cannot possibly thank them enough for everything they've done for me. I love you, Mom and Dad. My father in particular bears responsibility for my interest in the law. When I was four, we moved back to Miami so that he could be a full-time law student, and we lived on the campus of the University of Miami Law School. During those years, my mother pulled double duty working as the sole breadwinner of our family while also guiding and inspiring four-year-old me. My very earliest memories are of watching my father study. He had his stack of law books on the kitchen table while I sat across from him with my stack of coloring books. My parents also instilled in me and my younger brother Ketajh the importance of public service. After graduating from Howard University, Ketajh started out as a police officer following two of our uncles. After the September 11th attacks on our country, Ketajh volunteered for the Army and eventually became an infantry officer serving two tours of duty in the Middle East. Ketajh is here today providing his love and support as always. And speaking of unconditional love, I would like to introduce you to my husband of 25 years, Dr. Patrick Jackson. I have no doubt that without him by my side from the very beginning of this incredible professional journey, none of this would have been possible. We met in college more than three decades ago, and since then he's been the best husband, father, and friend I could ever imagine. Patrick, I love you. William Patrick's identical twin brother is here as well along with his wonderful wife, Dana. Also here from Park City, Utah, are Patrick's older brother Gabi and his wife Natalie. And last, but certainly not least, my very dear in-laws, the matriarch and patriarch of the Jackson family, Pamela and Gardener Jackson have traveled here from Boston to be with me today. I'm saving a special moment in this introduction for my daughters, Talia and Layla. Girls, I know it has not been easy as I've tried to navigate the challenges of juggling my career and motherhood, and I fully admit that I did not always get the balance right. But I hope that you've seen that with hard work, determination and love, it can be done. I am so looking forward to seeing what each of you chooses to do with your amazing lives in this incredible country. I love you so much. There are so many others who are not here today, but whom I need to acknowledge. I have a large extended family on both sides. They are watching from Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado and beyond. I also have incredible friends. Three of my college roommates came here today to support me and I have so many other boosters from Miami Palmetto Senior High School, Harvard undergrad, Harvard Law School and all throughout my personal and professional life. I've also had extraordinary mentors like my high school debate coach, Fran Burger, may she rest in peace She invested fully in me, including taking me to Harvard, the first I'd ever really thought of it to enter a speech competition, Mrs. Burger believed in me, and in turn, I believed in myself. In the category of great mentors, it was also my great good fortune to have had the chance to clerked for three brilliant jurists, US District Judge, Patti Sarris, US Court of Appeals Judge, Bruce Celia and Supreme Court Justice, Stephen Breyer. These extraordinary people were exceptional role models. Justice Breyer in particular, not only gave me the greatest job that any young lawyer could ever hope to have, but he also exemplifies what it means to be a Supreme Court justice of the highest level of skill and integrity, civility, and grace. It is extremely humbling to be considered for Justice Breyer seat and I know that I could never fill his shoes, but if confirmed, I would hope to carry on his spirit. On the day of his Supreme Court nomination, Justice Breyer said, quote, what is law supposed to do seen as a whole? It is supposed to allow all people  --  all people to live together in a society where they have so many different views, so many different needs to live together in a way that is more harmonious that is better so that they can work productively together end quote. I could not have said it better myself. Members of this committee, If I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and this grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years. I have been a judge for nearly a decade now, and I take that responsibility and my duty to be independent very seriously. I decide cases from a neutral posture. I evaluate the facts, and I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the case before me without fear or favor consistent with my judicial oath. I know that my role as a judge is a limited one, that the Constitution empowers me only to decide cases and controversies that are properly presented. And I know that my judicial role is further constrained by careful adherence to precedent. Now in preparing for these hearings, you may have read some of my more than 570 written decisions and you may have also noticed that my opinions tend to be on the long side. That is because I also believe in transparency that people should know precisely what I think and the basis for my decision. [*]KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: In all of my professional experiences, including my work as a public defender and as a trial judge have instilled in me the importance of having each litigant know that the judge in their case has heard them whether or not their arguments prevail in court. During this hearing, I hope that you will see how much I love our country and the Constitution, and the rights that make us free. I stand on the shoulders of so many who have come before me, including Judge Constance Baker Motley, who was the first African-American woman to be appointed to the Federal bench and with whom I share a birthday. And like Judge Motley, I have dedicated my career to ensuring that the words engraved on the front of the Supreme Court building, "equal justice under law", are a reality and not just an ideal. Thank you for this historic chance to join the highest court, to work with brilliant colleagues, to inspire future generations and to ensure liberty and justice for all. DICK DURBIN: Thank you, Judge Jackson. Well, this is the end of the first day of the first three days which are involving more personal -- on a personal level the Senators on the Judiciary Committee. In a way, it's the easiest day because 10 minutes is merely a throat clearing warm up for most Senators on this committee. [Laughter] Starting tomorrow, will be some serious exchange and questions of 30 minutes and then the following day 20 minutes for each Senator to participate in this. We're looking forward to this opportunity to finally really give you a fulsome opportunity to respond to many of the things that you've heard and to answer direct questions. Members have until Thursday at 5 pm to submit questions for the record. We're going to reconvene tomorrow morning at 9 am to begin the 30 minute rounds of questions. We thank all the participants and members of our audience for keeping this dignified, respectful, and civilized. And we hope to continue that tradition tomorrow. With this, the committee stands adjourned. ClassificationLanguage: ENGLISH Subject: SUPREME COURTS (92%); JUDGES (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); APPEALS (78%); APPELLATE DECISIONS (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (78%); LAWYERS (75%); APPEALS COURTS (73%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (70%); LAW SCHOOLS (70%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (65%) Industry: LAWYERS (75%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (70%); LAW SCHOOLS (70%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (65%) Person: KETANJI BROWN JACKSON (94%); RICHARD DURBIN (89%); THOMAS B GRIFFITH (89%); ALEX PADILLA (79%); BEN SASSE (79%); JOHN NEELY KENNEDY (79%); JON OSSOFF (79%); JOSH HAWLEY (79%); MARSHA BLACKBURN (79%); MAZIE K HIRONO (79%); RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (79%); TED CRUZ (79%); THOM TILLIS (79%); TOM COTTON (79%); CLARENCE THOMAS (78%); JOHN CORNYN (74%); JOHN F KENNEDY (72%); AMY KLOBUCHAR (59%); CHRIS COONS (59%); CHUCK GRASSLEY (59%); CORY BOOKER (59%); DIANNE FEINSTEIN (59%); LINDSEY GRAHAM (59%); MIKE LEE (59%); PATRICK LEAHY (59%); SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (59%) Geographic: TEXAS, USA (92%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%); HAWAII, USA (79%); IOWA, USA (79%); NEBRASKA, USA (79%); PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%); RHODE ISLAND, USA (79%); UNITED STATES (91%) Load-Date: March 22, 2022 End of Document  | About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright © 2020 LexisNexisMorgan RichardsonPage 1 of 1Senate Judiciary Committee Holds Hearing on the Nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States, Day 1
